drug in the work place
drug in the work place
just , before employment
but that 's about it .
've never
in my business random drug
have to do it
they started that about a year ago ,
trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff and .
beer and stuff at lunch time
with alcohol
with alcohol
they 'll check for alcohol .
once you start doing that stuff , you 're
that 's interesting .
what type of field of work
's in the oil business
in the oil business
work in the office ,
so it 's pretty safe environment .
the automotive industry air bag , when we make the safety for the cars bags ,
and around a lot of explosives we work .
that sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on .
's all explosives , for it , because i work in they 're working
they have with each of the explosives they use safety features ,
but still , it can be dangerous .
.
under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working in high risk industries , where you can really hurt other people , that you need have that kind of stuff
as long as
do n't have that big a problem with it
they do fire them ,
this is it ,
start having my problems with my company
i work for a private company
and the policy is
a controlled substance , then you
it 's probably the same thing .
those things that
just you and then if you 're not worried about it .
that 's right .
and they do give you a second chance ,
caught or if
a little on the second chance
ought then if they 're going to give you the opportunity
but when you 're a private company , the rules always do n't apply .
it 's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody is i work around in an office environment
have n't run into anybody that 's been a problem
much like any lottery it works ,
everybody 's got
you could time it just right .
, he had alcohol on his breath ,
's and
that 'd be just as dangerous .
especially around equipment , machinery and stuff
that 's true .
have a beer at lunch time , but not
any limits on alcohol
tell you the truth
do n't
they must ,
have been paying attention ,
really do n't know
'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
you can take too far
it was not only drugs ,
