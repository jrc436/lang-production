been drug
that 's a good question .
had to go get a test blood
they did a full screen blood on me , and
but they did n't called a test drug that .
think they checked for drugs
they do n't tell you did they just .
two or three drug tests
and do n't mind them
do n't do drugs anyway
did , maybe
but do n't know
she is a nurse ,
and they get .
have , never
something about if you got to worry
so guess .
so guess .
do you think that it is right ?
have done assistant employee work and
the kind of cost businesses
it is in the billions of dollars and every year .
and is the only way that they can prevent that .
that 's true .
if your boss 's
'll and up for you
and , nobody knows about it ,
but end up costing the company lots and lots of money .
that 's true .
, it is right , especially for certain jobs
randomly drug
in that full force , .
believe every secretary in every company needs to be
face forward fall in their typewriter or something
so do n't know
do n't do drugs
really do n't care one way
so , i guess is
is one of the problems with it
it does .
generally because you know .
out one way or another if somebody 's got a problem on the job
that 's true .
is just the secretary , if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then it still is a problem
that 's true .
to a party three days before
and it 's been the whole weekend since they 've done anything
and they could be fired for that ?
that 's kind of unfair , also .
comes
so guess .
you need suffer the consequences if you 're going to do it
in terms of drugs , and they are illegal .
you are so breaking the law anyway .
that 's true .
that 's true .
probably is the biggest problem with those
that 's true .
and that is the biggest problem there 's probably .
think so
more than drugs
they would pay for an alcohol
but they do n't always pay for drug rehabilitation .
out of it , some of the employee assistance program
if they will give you an opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose .
that 's true .
think that 's fair ,
in the long run the company benefits
that 's true .
say on it
what kind of
it 's a urine test .
urine screen
it was really very official .
seal the bottle yourself
so that they are anybody 's or something .
that happens .
, known
it 's hard to believe ,
it happens , a lot .
it does
to help them out
known
, at the things that people will do ,
it 's amazing .
are
expensive tests and .
never had to pay for
it depends on how strong a test it 's really .
they 've got different degrees , as far as how far they can check back .
so guess .
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests .
doing hair tests
weird how
did n't know that
that 's weird .
and it is apparently almost like a calendar .
got pretty now it
they can go back and look at , in terms of growth in a hair , when you used and that type of thing .
that 's wild .
it is the amazing things they can find out from on your body different things .
that 's true .
that 's true .
never giving blood
of giving blood
talking to you
did , too
thank you .
