an elderly family members to
in the world ever you 'd want to do unless it 's really for their own good just the last few things
very very careful out
she had a rather massive stroke about eight months ago .
in home in our little hometown
we had to do it
what an occasion had for my mother-in-law fell
that really was not a very good experience .
it had to be done in a hurry .
we did n't have six months to check out all of these places .
and it was not really very good deal .
home that we have finally
and she was able to return to her apartment again .
all the places out there who might be available
there is not one on every corner , especially smaller areas , smaller towns of course .
probably the hardest thing in my family my grandmother , she had
and she had a fall
care of her house and .
then she lived in an apartment
that was and even harder actually .
because it was just a change of location
for her very because
she all across the united states have children
nine months out of the year just visiting her children and .
and that was
can imagine
that 's tough .
that 's tough .
ran everything because her husband was in the mines coal away
facing that situation and it 's quite a dilemma .
to go ahead .
all the brothers and sisters got together
and they have a conference actually .
that 's great .
for our family , getting down together and doing that the most strengthened things
that 's right .
, making that decision , and then finding a place
everybody and have duties to perform .
whether it was just giving money
you were very , fortunate .
known
and they have seen it coming .
like that was happen if something that
a lot of responsibilities times like that fall to maybe one child in the whole family
it 's not a very smooth thing and usually .
have only one brother
my mother also was very independent .
after she had her stroke she was n't aware of what was going on really much
that home life
of course , she would not have been happy there at all .
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us .
she was very well aware
and her daughter visited her
and her daughter visited her
and her several grandchildren visited her every day
that 's great .
it was more of a relief for her .
but she was aware truly .
that would be tough .
it was n't of
make it , as possible
as that upon
how close is it to a home environment .
that 's right .
that is probably the major question .
in a whole lot of areas the
, of course , just .
in the united states we used to have .
it is kind of cumbersome , when it make things in reality much much easier
that 's right .
things and .
one of the solutions to a lot of even child care things think
because they are just
after all they raised us .
good experiences with
money seems to be too big of an issue .
it is realistically .
we put on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem
that would , certainly help .
of living as high a
that 's just a matter of defining priorities or some priorities anyway .
think you 're right
was that it
it was good talking .
take care .
what did you work today
's see
work today
so , you can dress pretty casually ?
on occasion
do vary
wear suits
and sweaters
can wear jeans on
about how you ?
a business out of my home
and and get back into regular clothes again
there is no code real dress work .
, do n't like
really out
work in a big building .
wear predominantly flat shoes so
the winter sweaters
dresses , short sleeves , things like that one piece
have a limited wardrobe , since
still , but it gives it some variety .
accessories
what about your casual wear ?
you do like to wear jeans most of the time ?
.
you can wear shorts , especially when it is so hot on a day like today
dress shorts
really a lot of compliments on them and .
i work is
,
is really only the woman at work that do that , but
but seems to work for me .
it is shorts
but it looks like a skirt .
think so that 'll be good for work , too
it 'll be comfortable .
quite a bit changed
and have a closet full of sweaters
that is interesting .
do but wear a lot of sweaters and things like dresses sweater
'd like to be able to wear those here
the closet for
today definitely was a day shorts around here .
we 're still pretty much in winter , as far as that goes here .
it feel good ,
get out , and about
discuss everything there are about clothing
good sound .
it was nice talking .
it was nice talking , also .
have you seen
, have seen that
that was a really good movie .
one of the best things about it probably was the scenery
and thought the story was pretty good , too
have you ever lived in that part of the country ?
have n't
have you ever visited it ?
could be .
up to that
it 's going to win everything apparently .
that 's true .
with that
for twelve awards
so , .
the interesting thing is
when somebody tells me great that it is
and the thing is that it was a good story .
that 's what
did look at my watch after about an hour
you did ?
with the enemy
great to be really that
you have to go see that one .
going .
you really must keep up .
.
every weekend
must see thought
it 's a movie terror
it or anything like that
it 's more suspense .
at points
think they are both excellent movies but
do you know who is he ?
he is the movie critic .
and he has a talk show on the , i f l k .
anyway , it 's on to nine or something from seven .
people and called in
it is kind of interesting if you up .
a certain of a
of kids , ten or twelve years old a
they called in and
movies and .
it is interesting .
him to
watch the movie .
it is interesting though
is the difficulty with dancing with wolves
he or did just do it ?
his heart , was in it
but do n't think he knew it was going to be as big as it was really
think it was something that he really wanted to do
he wanted
he wanted to star in it .
he enjoyed the story line
think he really wanted it and
whether it won all kinds of awards
think he did a good job
do you know who was the guy that was playing the driver wagon ?
little a piece of trivia
when the guy
,
do n't know who is that guy
he do ?
every week as
you can , believe that ?
'd a never
one of those interesting pieces of trivia that said somebody
you did
i
it 's really funny .
thought back
and
and it was
it was a lot of fun .
do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go
but we 're at about five minutes .
should think we 've done enough
think so ?
have n't been watching my watch
i guess ,
it does usually cut off ?
that what , it does 's ?
do n't know
why do we end this thing ?
used
think it says hang up just
so so guess .
we do that
is the first thing for me to see
is an invasion of privacy
first the type of privacy and seemed
does not in the second time , but at least
think
, and
that 's right .
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion
really wanted but this after
and it was sort of exciting
it turned out to be an invitation .
on the order of probably , seven or eight a week
from personal parties or from these commercial things phone
, primarily solicitations
that 's a remarkable number .
rarely get
two , that they have any effect
and waiting for it to finish what it had to say
an obligation to respond even though not there 's even a person there and then .
seems to be little control
, because of some sense of the way the ritual be played out and
and then , that ends up being for me the most common example .
relative to this one you raised typically
and do n't
think that 's a good idea on your part
would prefer not to be known ,
that second type of privacy without you
ca n't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia and
'd like to think it 's quite low in this country and
is not and
no sense of
it in terms of information gone even
but do n't
from those sorts of things
is not sure
it comes from a sense of fact or facts
and do n't have a sense of loss from that if someone find out something about me that 's true
you must have then a relatively clean conscience .
or something
you do n't
did
when they canceled a letter
my sense of threat would
would have thought to be private for instance
but if it turns out that is even worse then
they have
what the person had take unsolicited phones calls
your thirty a week and then because now , they are advertising you get .
to select only companies give it out just like software is only given out to customers ,
you ca n't believe that .
it would be pirated
someone who is offering cash full price , for it to
a company do with it
is being able to know what your income
touch with
what started as an invasion of privacy and suddenly can be an invasion of your actual home .
or you 're not feeling
maybe so , that 's a little bit of what is privacy
because there is not so much invasion of my privacy
order to have not people
realize and for
things quite different in terms of that there
there 's less of a sense of privacy .
that is interesting .
no concept for wanting to be private but
alone is officially what it is generally being
doors do n't
people do n't
and you open because it is in your way
people walk out in
it 's very much .
and people would leave , me alone .
people start paying very much attention to you
does a set of social norms but
which is n't always the case in all cultures ,
that 's true .
have n't
think a lot of someone who do n't know how to say private
wonder how people have sex and things like that ,
the results of sex obvious , quite as the population goes up an extra every few hundred years million
there are hope ,
because anyone can be alone for some period of time
require for me , but
really do n't know how to live very well ,
really do and
that is interesting .
on a day-to-day basis , or either on a growing frequency
that sense and is now opened my door
is they and
my number to be
but no one is
that is so more of a sense of invasion .
going down a list
and they are either offering a service
they or are introducing some new product in the area
normally and when
of cooking something
and you have to stop everything to run to the phone .
that one that you are talking about is .
is talking
weird working hours
and invariably is going to sleep , the phone tears off the wall just about the time
out of a half unconscious sleeping
as soon as
somebody all ready starting , reading or off
that 's true ,
the ones that or .
just a computer voice
really really hate too
had some of them , even
they are voice activated
say twice before they 'll do anything
my machine at home
've got a whole bunch of messages
going through them and
most of them and .
we 've got a thing in this country ,
your phone number
working instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this area certain code and call them
have an unlisted telephone number ,
of those calls all
do n't understand even
so
,
that 's an invasion of my privacy
you on
let
that 's about that , as far as any other everyday occurrences --
a stop to some of them
would have gone either to the store
for their salesman to come out
that 's true .
living in an apartment complex , though ,
they come up to the front door
'll call the apartment manager and tell them there are people coming around ,
's and
they or are from a religious organization
really that and .
,
have somebody who came to the door about two weeks ago
would consider family hours ,
, and do n't care for it particularly
for them to my door like
they want to ,
is
'll call for them ,
otherwise do n't
with you there .
they do n't try and pull in me and drag me in
and do n't
and , it 's
door to door
and out into
and they 've actually the teenagers serving two years in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary work type
and do n't know ,
just do n't care for that at all particularly
up to my door , and especially religious organizations
have
the part about where you said
a storm door on
do n't know how much clearer it can be ,
with silver letters a red sign saying
that 's true ,
did n't go far that
but
could do the same thing , probably
do n't have a storm door ,
but do n't think that would stop people
it is
and go , instead of stop it says .
that would be technically illegal ,
it would
consider an invasion of my privacy , a harassment but
that 's true ,
that 's true .
what else ?
have up pretty much
, known
talked ,
and you , said
me think
and soliciting and selling things at the door
you said something else .
, ca n't remember what it was
that kind of touched a nerve , right there
but we got to talking about the people coming at the front door .
is
our five minutes are up ?
close to it .
pretty close .
talking with you
and to take it easy .
thanks ,
too got a call yesterday
, though , this is
, there is n't there
think there 's really
it is kind of an easy thing to talk about .
you have to push
and then we can start recording it .
you now ready
it would be the work force as far as changes in the generations
there was n't very many opportunities for her , when my mother was going into the work force
care of the kids
and have never faced that at all
you work when they are six weeks old ,
stay there and .
you feel and 'll probably right along with your husband just work .
think it 's better got definitely
to
much .
and it 's just going to get better .
it 's really .
in every field
they are not
ca n't either ,
a not one
do n't think men really took the time to work
hopefully , the next generation that it wo n't be even an issue ,
people will look just at you as a person and not as a man or a woman ,
think that would be the best goal
too
just your qualifications
and that would be it .
exactly ,
what you 're not
that would
, though , it 's kind of an ideal world
thinking maybe in time , that you 'll go by social security numbers ,
and they ca n't say that way
or the way
your age or anything
think that would be a wonderful way to do it
to
at you qualifications that you have
have also with women in the work force
as a matter of fact , that 's
it is .
it is sure .
that would be great .
it is sure .
and we could send her messages ,
basically worked out just like that of her house
would take just once every week or two
that worked out and too great .
and that is , if you have the technology for it a real attractive option
she was like she was sitting in the office , and
with different options
the job
,
do you ?
really
think it 's great
'll work two
and she 'll work two ,
that 's great ,
just off like that and .
do you get the full benefits ?
the full benefits
is that
but we 've really just got a wonderful system that we are working under .
that would be great especially with children , and so many things going on .
it 's really ,
that way and we 're not
you have your career and your home life ,
that would be a nice way , especially if you have young children and .
it is ,
it is ,
both of ours is school age ,
just in my son 's day-care
but even that they have extracurricular activities
and the older they get .
think it 's great ,
and look for more of that in the next generation
can say they
that would
, too , .
bet it cuts down on your absenteeism because you 've got off two days
sick , or the child 's
most of the time it 's just the weekend , now
just .
doctors ' and dentists 's office with
that 's been too real helpful ,
that 's real helpful , so
you do n't have to do it during office hours
it is always been that way .
she worked always ,
but it was n't easy for her to take off just that .
compared to the work that she did she did n't make probably hardly anything and
men and women in the same job work ,
men get
, too , .
but think that are improving
it 's such a slow process
it is frustrating ,
but , you can see it is wrong
you just want to make right , and
the wheels moving forward
really .
think it 's getting worse , not better
probably should get back to my job
, known
the
again
sure i
what kind of music
popular music to
all the time in my car
switch stations a lot
find myself listening to popular music , but
quite honestly and have little some children
but that 's not by my choice .
about how you ?
do n't have that , experience to share
lucky you
do n't have a player in my car cassette
, however , like a lot of different forms of music ,
quite often .
particular really to about
there is such a wide selection ,
a little bit of a lot of different types of music
done right or if
it 's not
n't really
how do you feel about rap music ?
rap .
it seems to be so popular these days .
really do n't have anything against rap music
do object to about rap music
have strong objections to that
it really was
heard when it was just starting
between it and rap the
a lot
you can pick up it really ,
by a lot of different music
, but they have been put to a kind of a rhythm rap
so much different
to a lot of music rap
all of the words to songs that she , are listening to
yet , and she thought they were brand new , original pieces .
they do cover versions of , standards .
that 's right .
they really do n't give the original artist or the original composer , the credit that is due to them really
seems to be the hot one of today
he used wild thing .
do you remember that song .
ca n't remember that who the artist was on
who
maybe it was n't that one .
because , is said
because they have n't got originally permission , from him to use it .
and every time on the song goes
do n't know
maybe .
, ca n't think
it was really old .
so many different songs
is to listen to this
that was really great .
that was a really good piece of work ,
it 's when the cover and then .
they destroyed it .
it was
did too
did n't like that either
he was a phenomenon ,
there were no reason for him to come really .
think it was in high school
think what did for him it probably was the fact that he was a good performer stage
he was very good .
hundreds of thousands of people are what it seemed like .
was really into the album oriented music , even then ,
you about to do n't know what you 're talking
you can only laugh .
can them at just
our age are showing when
like a lot of the new music
and then do n't know
it is in a very weird position right now .
that are using all these natural forms of music
that 's not really music world .
what do you mean by world music ?
a lot of where they make music that
and then , it 's when another form of music
trying to draw the best sources out of
the best of every type of music
some types of heavy metal
but would n't say that completely like heavy metal
world music take the forms that have been really the cream of the crop , ,
become so then , it
a kind of
they make it modern somewhat more
he is a jazz performer ,
we 're going to have to get off .
trying
do n't know
our five minutes
and it was just incredible
that a lot
listened
the muted trumpet and then .
me ,
and you never would think they can play together actually
we , keeping a budget about two years , ago started out
we have a computer here , at the house ,
is basically since then and keep track of it through the checkbook
because our payment house is a month , once
that is our biggest expense
take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck
a running
what do all you do ?
what have how much we have , we taken write down
of the year the
we made up ,
a budget for each household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our own money fun and just stuff like that
, time and then each
we try to stay within a certain budget ,
it 's hard to keep track of it
it or does work pretty well out ?
it takes some dedication to do it ,
but it works out real well ,
and you 're staying within your budget
and everything is working pretty good .
have to stay within it ,
if something comes up and you ca n't stay within it then we have a budget for we
you do n't then
you do n't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that .
of the month the
that 's a good choice ,
that we do this year
we 're going to pay off all of our credit cards
you 've got under your table paper .
we have another loan with the bank , and
by hope and so , by doing that we 'll be free and clear that
be out
free .
, is a loan automobile and our house payment
that 's good to be in that kind of shape .
we try to stay out of debt .
do long term
it is long term .
we have just and our life insurance for right now .
so , we do n't have any long term in stocks , or anything like that right now ,
so much a check pay or
it and then .
that 's what we 're doing .
work pretty good out
retired from there
and we have
some money in an i r
we 're putting it in c d 's right now ,
also and then we 're looking at it in getting possibly a mutual fund .
we got enough ever
if we need it and then we wait until it is expired
based on salary and what our goals was on a long term analysis and their agent did
we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time .
or not ,
that sounds interesting ,
our guy life insurance came out
if something was happen
if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me , figuring out what we would need
a big thing about to think
--
would sell and move back to my home town home ,
do n't know what he would do so
right now is that most of my financial plans
mine too
there is anything you 'd like to add ?
is that
it 's been nice talking .
to you too .
touch wonderful tone
books do you reading
therefore , .
read too that one
, had only once a subscription
but my mother always gave me hers
it is absolutely great the way that it is broken out and you can set up little trips and trips and things days
it is
like
do n't take a subscription or anything like that
a lot of things and management energy type of magazines
about how
have an interest in art ,
water because that 's my big interest at the moment
that 's great .
things lots of
that 's fairly interesting .
that i bet
that 's self improvement ,
that 's kind of a hobby
but it 's improvement from the standpoint of relaxing probably self .
self improvement
about how you ?
.
classes management
you books
if you 're not serving the customer , you better be serving someone is
on what the customer 's
our own customer and as you probably well known , .
's your customer , sort of thing
do n't think of in terms of improvement self
they
but do n't
like what for example
, do n't know
had some tapes that went with them , but not so much books although they have sometimes manuals and things ,
self improvements
managing different types of people
and the very last chapter is how to manage engineers .
so it is interesting ,
here are it again casual reading
with a lot of mechanical stuff
and it 's really excellent
, do n't know
for me a little
they are hard to set because it 's so interesting down
they get through one of them
a hard time
also have been reading a lot of things on quality improvement
but sometimes used the word is a little over
exactly right .
what it is we 're saying
think it 's just focusing on the issue in and walking your talk
all that kind of
but that 's just kind of part of it .
any other comments
not can think of
is under a little bit my quota
need probably make a phone call or two
we just , started
this is true .
enjoyed it
you too
.
have a good day .
do n't know about you
have an extremely lax dress policy at work , but
every day from jeans and one to suits business the next day .
it 's pretty bad ,
but it is true ,
they try to be real lax
supposedly and the policy is like we
go ahead
one the next day and suits business
's kind of that way , too ,
the legal department
have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
several times a day of documents boxes around
are doing that
and wearing heels and stuff
odds and ends and stuff with
a meeting , where we are having the attorneys come in , or other party 's attorneys and stuff
'll wear a dress and hose and stuff and
we 're kind of too that way .
the same way
i kind of try judge from day to days .
with the customers a lot
and we have a lot of government folks
is going to be there
months the same way
the floor and dig through boxes
that 's right ,
that 's right .
it is
as a matter of fact thought
we have them in the warehouse ,
was across the road over at the warehouse and
and it was n't
of the summer the
it was
of the row the very
and that was it .
we wore shorts .
we did n't know that was a big no , no .
the supervisor from another area and come to us up
only a few people
he and who worked , there
and he come to us up
he said , who is your supervisor and just .
our supervisor and our supervisor 's supervisor
it went up , complaining that we were wearing shorts and
did n't at least say to us
called on it out
awful how
it sounds like power hungry mister .
and do n't care ,
you can call them
but these was shorts .
that 's all they were .
, do n't care what else you call them
if they are below the knee
maybe you can
turn if they are above the knee .
these were n't even and really full ones .
have a problem with it out here last summer , they
these were n't even those and .
these was pretty short , black ,
that was the black velvet shorts
and she had on black hose and black heels
and she looked very , very nice .
you do n't but
she was in violation , as far as
nobody and say anything to them .
we 're going to draw the line
this is shorts .
and nobody will ever
so , we have a pair of those at home too .
sure it would
they said no
just because you put .
have never seen them without hose do it ,
they 've always hose on ,
still , but they 're shorts ,
do n't
they are shorts .
that d s , has a very strict dress code
had a friend ,
do they really ?
had a friend who worked for a year or so there
it and out .
is definitely
are not
wear you
could n't afford to work there
particular of kind
it is spelled out .
she had when her benefits packaging and all that kind of stuff .
and it told about the code dress
, is that it
is very particular about this , hair cuts , and
do n't know that would be a good environment to work in
,
do n't know about anybody else ,
may a lot of bosses and
is in pants
.
i work
, is in a dress and heels
and it is weird
get more so much done if
she was told and we were going to be in a warehouse
but she did n't really get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not to the warehouse , but the warehouse the office .
and just like she came .
any pants or anything and .
we 're in the warehouse out here ,
in the skirt
you ca n't do that in a poor soul skirt .
she finally tried to go buy a pair of pants
but it was just miserable completely for her .
that 's terrible ,
that 's terrible
, do n't know
figure just
go in pants in
in and in a pair of jeans
'll go in pants in , but
if upper management , does n't notice that and remember that later on
but do n't
a lot of the managers
and they are in jeans ,
we have to the general counsel assistants
it is funny and
because , there is one who always wear a suit .
he wears and sometimes the jacket to it .
some of the patent attorneys and
is n't
of had a variety there
that 's great .
is a lot of it times they 're going
is they or then
and they are usually
that 's the smart way to do it .
they come in , in a hundred six three dollar piece
it or would me .
look at this slick guy ,
what kind of money does he make
can now see it
it was good to talk to you .
it was enjoyable really .
is this kind of a fun project .
it 's really .
have done some of the other programs speech ,
have but never
it was talking just to the computer always .
this is a little different so .
it is kind of enjoyable ,
really is looking forward to it
a lot .
it been this week for you
,
.
we have gone through , what might be called the four seasons in the last week .
ours been like then
heard about that
a record yesterday and .
the wind dropped off , and also , the temperature
so , very cool
it feels cool compared to yesterday
no rain do n't think in .
is very dry
so our work yard , is being dry pretty tough
it also bring about allergies ,
we 're right now having a lot of allergies down here .
everything
the weather and
a lot of people
has a lot of people out at
the blue flu ,
on the blue flu , .
we have variable weather
, also , and we have ,
the grass been growing
mow , if you could go out and buy ,
and you do not have to go out and buy .
we have an unusually warm spring
we 're still in winter ,
we have no snow
no snow ?
speak of
from six to twelve inches during the winter
we had total inches less than four accumulation
in that regard , so it is fine ,
it is .
down in the southern and western more areas
about two hours from the northern border , straight south
it does ,
-- if any very seldom
and it was every day that way .
so that , you become
we have a relatively mild winter , speaking for this area of the country
there for eight years myself
but , did n't
originally can tell
very much ,
very much ,
as much as
my father , was in the air force
.
worked for the government ,
this is my first conversation in this series
received my personal identification number
is not sure how long we are supposed to talk
just as , as long
and just a lengthy reasonable conversation
not .
an application from
for some time
have been for a number of years ,
was so very much interested , in being a speaker for this
, is an environmental engineering and
.
and they just published
that 's really strange .
a representative in the area
have been a speaker in other similar type of activities , but
is this
was interested in being a speaker so as
much about the weather
is that
see 's
, were looking at it
speedy cuts short
it 's not
engineering place , or just the work place environment
it is actually water waste .
.
actually is in the air division ,
or out of a building
in the place work
and we take care of that ,
the call was supposed to be concerning recycling , in the community last evening .
about it before hand a little bit
but that is interesting .
have a friend is a planner
he modeling computer and so does forth
he got inputs from an environmental engineering .
actually , our division 's corporate wide ,
we have several plants here , of course
also air modeling but .
.
all of this information temperature , speeding wind , wind direction
a huge chemical data
that is interesting .
our data chemical
every on site , its concentration
and if we 'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station .
about music
and do you like classic rock or modern rock or which kind ?
, that is that kind of music ,
, is it disco
not kind .
that is cool .
the rolling stones and
went to their concert last year when they were here
is that
like
just did n't know that much about music
was n't sure what kind of music and
it 's very hard
heavy metal or classic rock to
what kind of heavy metal
what ,
we 're talking about what they call hard rock .
give me some examples
like bad company ,
what ,
bad company , is not bad
that 's not ,
a c c
a c c
why ,
have you heard of them ?
like that
that 's not really hard rock .
did n't really consider that heavy metal
a c c
but other bands consider it really hard rock .
really do n't care for that too much , i guess
and , what happens is like everybody
start they and then ,
just and they
with their shoulders each
you and then down
of all these other people
the kind of
do n't like that music
but , is that
really heavy metal
the difference between hard rock and heavy metal and is also the lyrics .
and you always thought about suicide .
they do n't talk about that ,
life in
of course .
you 're talking queen ,
what you said
but you got to also like queen .
were growing up
especially a night at the opera ?
see 's
opera whole in the background
that was great .
on the radio
it and up .
just because .
that was a real good one .
was pretty good
then , but they started
that 's true .
they come with some pretty weird stuff after that up .
they are still around ,
they 've got a new c
like the old rolling stones .
do n't like the new stuff
of the stones
.
the older stuff is the best of it .
for today 's rock and roll too much
, genesis
.
.
with he and then came out
that was good ,
but it was
a lot of money
with the invisible touch came out , and then with
ca n't stand him
i look at him
with these people , and
and you , was great
are you and now
it is still going to be a hit number one .
so , and that 's
but , did you go see that new movie doors ?
.
have been , kind of considering it
yet have you seen it ?
saw it when it opened
it was really good ?
and , they both loved the movie ?
they said the music is great ,
it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that .
then , and everything is great , said one of them
is going to give it thumbs down , but
and go
but why
because is
is the movie
pick just you and the music goes with it , up
so , you really did n't grow up with that kind of then music .
it 's just the music sixties 's got a lot to say .
disco , do n't like disco
like disco
i bet you were out there with your bottom pants bell , but
that 's true .
that 's true .
did you go to college ?
is going right now
that is cool .
but
did n't go then
, do n't know
disco was pretty much dead by then .
disco was n't really my time .
about music ?
about everything
everything , during the sixties happened
nobody name it
that 's kind of funny .
you 're right .
never thought of that
the years disco gone
known
what is it
him standing just there .
that 's a good example to look for in history .
happened in
do n't worry ,
do n't worry ,
you 're not missing anything ,
that 's true .
they do n't want to talk ,
they just do n't name it , so .
it was pretty bad times
that 's very true .
see 's
we have been talking for seven minutes ,
good .
have n't been keeping track even
is going to leave alone you
are
do you have a family ?
of supper the
it 's a big deal , but not
is
left it just
it is
somebody tried to call me last night
, but did n't have yet my number
just got today it
and so it 's
'd be available during this time ,
so .
then had fun doing this .
it is
all been able to do much as
pardon
these days to do much as a full family
we have gone all kinds of places ,
go out to dinner
we take the kids to the park ,
whenever my husband had time off or something , and we take them to the zoo ,
everything we can possibly as a family or .
you do work outside the home ?
n't
n't either
it makes it a little bit easier that way .
it does ,
then an my husband , enjoy spending time with the kids
he 'll take just to be with them them .
you have a break so too .
and we try to as much as we can at home , teach our kids
all kinds of fun things like that
we have family that are far away .
it sounds like you might too .
,
is so by pictures
phone calls and that 's about it .
to the park
go in the backyard
, pretty simple things
one is especially since fourteen only months .
and like to go places
with me being at home and having just one the income and you do n't have , this lot of extra money to do a lot of extra things
that 's right .
they think that 's a lot of fun .
so we try to spend as much as we can time .
our whole weekends devoted to our children except for we
during the day 's , but it
church and with us
that 's true .
you ever be to the place science
here too long
we and there ago went
the kids thought .
science one and two science place
we have been in place two science only .
is not sure
it was , when we went .
place in my mind is a kid 's area
they really seemed to go wild in there .
they have a lot of fun in there
and the kids can pet animals and stuff .
is that
that 's a lot of fun and .
tours going through
the kids and think that was a lot of fun , too .
that does sound like fun .
it 's a little bit of a ways ,
they do n't go for the food
they play around
that 's right .
it 's a indoor park fun and
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids .
that too sound .
parents and get
during the week , and it 's five admission dollars per child , all day
fun
think we 'll try to do that maybe
the kids , just have a wonderful time there
you pay , just
all the rides and then free
of course , they have all the little video games , and those little quarter to rides and stuff like that
but , they thought was that lot of fun .
you can have birthday parties there
so they have a lot of fun .
that does sound like fun .
've got some good ideas from you
do n't know if we 've done five minutes
is sure that will be good , but
that will be good ,
it was good talking .
it was good talking .
your suggestions
no problem .
take care .
my favorite show is
it been for a long time
meet never what anybody like
do you by any chance ?
you
very much
would
as a matter of fact , .
i watching
what you 're
that 's good .
you do read ?
because they are kind of based on books are
at least here in the united states for us , is the only access to of course that we have
are usually news and what is on public television
me too
you did stay late up and catch this red dwarf ?
that was a scream .
used to too like him ,
he was my hero .
they die at this moment
he can cut it never .
that 's true .
was just thinking that today ,
he did well in some of the movies later
he does .
liked his accent too
and , he can even
and he still comes off great .
he is .
he had my vote double .
do n't care
and particularly
what is about that ?
that was about the interior minister ,
it was a comedy ,
have seen several times it
it 's a scream ,
have to go to bed , but
have to get up and work the next morning
did to watch this red dwarf late
do n't think they should show during prime time it ,
still , but it was funny .
known
quite a bit said
reading in addition to the technical stuff all about two or three novels a week .
what do you do ?
what kind of work do you do ?
is a payroll clerk
just an accounting clerk
.
and just
needed , but the money
this is five bucks here .
we 're not supposed to be talking , though , even
not guess .
did hear about it
a data for
and , also that 's my field of work .
heard about it , and
we could go back to television shows .
speaking of public tv , have you caught any of this series on the bible ?
have
it is coming out with the idea that the bible is not true
you could interpret it that way .
one word for love of your brother , one word for love of your wife , one word for love of your father , and that sort of thing
in how one might now interpret the bible
they saying it is not true ,
you look at it
if then , you can look at it that way very much .
but as far as
that 's right .
but do n't know if there 's a limit on this time ,
have surely
think so too .
very talking
it was very nice talking .
and have a good evening .
too you
how it is appropriate to be talking ?
my husband 's right now teaching an aerobics class .
that the class aerobics
you 're a student ?
anything with
and how do you feel about it ?
have more time to exercise
the sake of
do n't
and try
this is my time exercise
a lot of time
exercise more than your average person and probably get .
a structured sort of thing
for exercising sake 's
to me it 's not fun or something like that
that 's the way my mother stand on it .
if , then it becomes a chore ,
and , she does n't enjoy it when it 's a chore .
down
a week
you like , because someone else is doing the counting for you ,
have always and
all the time
we could .
and it is
you are using different parts of the body
so , it 's like dancing ,
's and
like someone else 's counting , you said
so , it make it easier for me .
's move , instead of me having so much to think about it
you can trust someone else to give you full exercise just
and is follow along and enjoy yourself
, but is like you
that was a lot of fun and
you to meet different people and get out , and about out just
we did it as a family ,
so , it was quite a lot of fun .
love
love when it is swimming weather , so it
did n't realize that
is
have done ,
and did n't realize they were going to reach out to people from , all over the country
you would n't know that .
regional real differences
started out here
do n't know where they started , actually
big here , but really
and before that there was the running craze .
is how well , but elsewhere on
so , there must be something to some of them .
related health ideas
there is a sense of it being a package ,
institutes for
and , it does n't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything .
scientific fairly solid
with these distinctions
and there 's no reason to talk about one rather than another , so they combined them all together
there 's been some progressive medical schools , who have taken that approach out here .
people motivated that way
there is a correlation ,
but could n't
and would then each feed off one another and develop a little bit more and more a little bit
the more money .
can see that
know from institutes of learning like that
be willing to pay for it
exactly .
some of them out and fizzled
and some of them were disastrous
and others of them have an impact on the society around here .
one of the ones that have an impact , and was people becoming interested in alternate practices
and you could have long enough around them
more and more people and starts
and exercise is considered strongly one of them .
the irony is
all day in back of their desks and .
or they 're older .
pardon
sometimes think it 's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city
everything else .
living in a rural area
i
the race to exercise rat
stays in a rural area a person
think so .
as a fit person
a little bit about
and they do n't do very much vigorous exercise at all .
low , low impact , exercise stress low
some sort of relaxation
they do n't have the hard body .
they do n't have ,
and is an awful lot of exercise sort of image conscious .
to a hundred and some ten
you think a lot of that is too diet
and , is a lot of that diet .
that 's true .
read a lot of information
what is that ?
is as
also
it is in the urban areas ,
in the urban areas
is that
most , sort of modern looking restaurants , will
that 's great ,
it 's such a trouble here .
you 've just
was
and , it occurred to me ,
an influx of a lot of people from all over the country
so , you 're going to have more choices ,
but , in urban areas are it places steak --
it is changing to a degree ,
, even with health stores and stores food where you can buy
you do n't have that really ,
you would think .
think that was the topic crime in the city
do not live in a city
living in a small little real place .
where 's that ?
,
not too far
have been through there
is about eight miles south of it
as watching the news and reading the papers and all that , it sounds like the crimes in the cities really getting bad
those statistics and everything
, known
known
known
murder is nothing to them .
a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , i guess
are you
let and just
kill again and just them if
today 's to eliminate the criminals from society
if someone is known to have been in prison , they ca n't get a job .
you know .
they ca n't
and who is put the limit on it ?
out on the street after one or two years
your prison term
into the mental hospital
'll and if
a cure for it
but there is no now known cure .
in other words , if , that 's not real bad ,
people make mistakes .
go ahead
use that
or there are other consequences rather than killing them ,
, to make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against always
they might get some benefit in that , at least
committed they and they can free them if the people
can the property but with the technology we have today
and , you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act .
putting them in prison that do n't work , but
apparently , not
many years they 've been doing that
.
you look at places like turkey .
turkey has the death penalty , for just about everything .
of drug trafficking
of heinous crimes
there is no two ways about it .
you look at their society and
the repeat offenders and .
been in prison three or four times
three or four times ,
that 's true ,
known
one , you need
think that 's very important
very much on so that
for any reason take the kids away from the parents
because .
because that 's what our society becomes .
we have just a bunch of people ,
was doing construction work
they , these guys and work every morning
and they are
are so high , they could
they work , and
home and go
and and
go down to the corner store
sure ,
, do n't
and worked in a first grade for one full semester classroom
kid one
in the first grade
the finger and all that
said just to this kid , and
said you got two choices kid ,
you can step into mainstream society
or you can die .
because you will eventually .
known
, known
i work in school
is that
is like you
the younger ages know what ,
they and at home .
if , that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school .
it 's really ,
and that 's
you can see in the work place it .
when you have a conflict personality you worked with it be
and you got through it .
people , now get fired
or is even worse , is they
or one
that many people on
it is in their culture .
.
the company , took a position for these people and upon itself to find .
if , they did n't
a position for them
but she do n't like it .
she just do n't like to do that .
.
just have a hard time lately finding any spare time
that 's my case also .
got
and there 's no just time .
several years
my husband is interested in it even now .
me design projects
at the pattern
to do get that
that hard not
it 's not .
really .
you started on it
a lot of my own patterns
it was tough ,
but .
have any others ,
mostly that
and stuff
but do n't know
do n't have them all certainly yet
got to counting the other day
have two hundred ,
it can add quick up .
an inventory of
are low on
.
a lot of times you can do that .
all the different colors
came out last year , that they added
but , you do n't have much spare time either
lately .
just started a new job
and that does take some time .
how old ?
he 's seven months old .
and just into everything ,
not so there is a spare moment .
but would n't trade it for the world
we missed it last year ,
so he 'll have one hopefully this year .
he was a little bit young for having one last year .
enjoyed it anyway
you would have
all he liked this year , was the lights
that 's kind of strange that we got the same call .
is
to go ahead .
is that
but
have been doing it for probably ten years or so
thinking about five years ago
but it 's peaceful ,
the time to do it
got and one to do
is the child
thing bear
bought the cloth and the pattern for it
did n't buy a kit
it is that cloth .
it 's cloth
and it already has the borders , and everything .
those pretty
number one turned out , great just
done , in the colors that it
and did n't even know it
gave it to her
she and say how the colors we used .
said did n't
it worked out that way .
that 's great .
like
those pretty
she does n't
on the wall .
they are just too nice .
enjoyed this
too you
is the topic
and for me that are mostly newspaper and radio ,
almost never , as a matter of course
do n't get news from television , so
that 's not true ?
the different sources of news coverage
do n't know
wanted just more news
what is the one other ,
b c .
b c .
they were ?
the only thing
listened to radio on my job at work like you and
of what you 've got the
was watching on tv and
for our people all
they were n't even aware of it ,
how do we know if the news we 're getting is any good
can remember being in these earthquakes and
of view anyone else 's
but they get all blown up in the news .
specially tv
on murders and things like .
we have a lot of bad stuff , and
it really just got
wake up so then one morning
in war with somebody
you do n't even know about it .
but do n't read newspapers
do n't you ?
how
follow from one to another page
an interest in
can get out and get it
that sounds pretty bad to me .
who would steal a newspaper ?
you would
and they up even if it is just for the tv selections of the day
.
do n't know
it would n't just
you 're right ,
who would steal a newspaper ?
but , .
is speaking to you from
grew up in a l , but
work out here .
n't
and gone to work
is in the computer business
current events is not
do n't keep up with it often that
see 's
never have done before this ,
this is first your call ?
, so do n't know
it seems to me say it
think we have been talking for three minutes , but
nobody and .
got into a conversation with a lady last night
.
to you .
to you too .
how you doing ?
bad ,
not bad
what 's your name ?
waiting .
turn off
for about ten minutes
are
see 's
on the other coast
it is almost midnight ?
what ?
we are supposed to talk ,
about what
credit card ?
waiting .
one of my instructors said they were doing something like this
you working on
a masters in information systems
my masters in
where
how do you like it out there ?
from a bigger than this one city
that area
and it 's really small .
are all you have
so it is basically
but they do n't have a whole lot there .
where
and that 's about it .
and it is only a hour away to a large city .
where do you go ?
they look for
it 's hard to say .
known
did n't apply
it 's pretty tough .
it 's pretty tough .
let
so far the school take you only .
it is
so do n't lose any sleep over stuff like that
you going to go for your doctorate
probably .
is in the navy
get out of the navy
when you do get out ?
probably be another twelve years
are doing right now
what they pay for it , but if
excuse me ?
they wo n't pay for it .
known here that work for the army
or
think they are military
he and so are doing his masters here .
they gave him a scholarship for a year .
and he is doing it in a year and a summer .
and he is getting so
and they said they got a lot of benefits and that .
you want to join
you can earn a lot more money
you still there if you can earn a lot more money , once you have to get
they got a lot of benefits that would go with it
so .
in is it the money that not keep people
what they 're doing
they good about what they 're doing
of thing
and that 's not what they are paying .
easily
is sure
depends , of course
known
and far
and everyone is a manager .
get to earn so much money
it is fairly competitive since .
all the major companies get ,
and then they come in last
why they came in last
because the person asked for it .
he goes , the problem was there was five people saying row , row , row , and one person rowing
so he goes have you come up with a solution ?
is a , manager
but it 's like one person
, do n't know
that can slow down you really .
that 's the way it works .
that 's why they are having problems .
everyone is a manager
did n't realize that
it is
just the other people and then .
paper around
these people just sitting around , just going
of anything
and then along comes
is that
this track which it 's going around the world
your package is
they have this tank think so .
and they got to come up with ideas .
a on a lot of the market
and it fails
and you 're dead .
did
so .
that 's their policy .
unless you 're
or something
if you 're stealing something or doing anything like that .
but they wo n't let you off .
is a manager
so they 'll put you into keeping up the paper .
it is , how much paper is going in ?
you say that 's not my job , and then
so .
in other words , so , is that
that 's why they can say there is no layoff policy .
they do n't really say , but
you 're always going to have great career conditions .
kind of
but it 's like they have different just policy .
do n't know
my dad work for them
in their commercials , they never put down
they are the standard right now .
they have a good backup policy because is what happens .
and anybody can fix it .
that 's what you 're going to go for and so .
that 's a big thing .
and it is for example , like leading edge .
have you ever heard of leading edge ?
what ?
leading edge .
small personal computers
do n't know
do n't know
for a chip test
it ca n't
but it can
leading edge will say we 'll buy from you it .
they are still around .
have seen around anyway them
so , is that
by the time you 've computer for five years , and you 're going to throw away anyway it
most people
or they have to anyway .
and he got that .
was testing it
and it was
and then it takes up when all your memory .
more and .
it is why do you want more .
because it is
into wave
and you want to correct the errors into wave ,
it takes , so much
of course it does .
you put in there , and
and you want to correct those .
you make the wave
it 's going to take a lot of course .
what it is for us to make mark off models .
it 's amazing .
down to it the more they can do for you , the more memory they 're going to require when
like they say nobody can get enough .
more out
what ?
this is like video game stuff .
but that it was just lines , was the only thing
what do you think in terms of benefits ?
is sure we are familiar with the exact same benefit package of course
think we 've got probably one of the best around , and
they offer adequate vacation , i guess
the paying off time
think that 's just a fabulous one , and
in that or not
is n't it great ?
it 's a miracle just how fast that adds up .
have to agree with that
was waiting for the system to find
and started
and suspect that is probably true for everyone
consider to consider medical benefits
the medical benefits but as
the retirement and is more important .
really thought of it that way
that 's true ,
that 's true
to me the vacation 's real
's real important to me , and that kind of thing and
is a hundred vested percent you kind of look through the book
, now is only in my twenties late
you think about retirement not
, is the time to think
think they have one that we need recognize that we 're going to have to supplement ourselves
it 's certainly a supplemental way ,
it wo n't be adequate for my situation by itself all .
it 's not going to build up , quite enough ,
have to find a way to supplement that so
they make it easy to save so
have got money coming to buy , just coming straight out of my check out , but
and it 's probably not
if the money but would n't
i kind of have to trade off .
if you do n't spend it ,
though ,
believe me ,
myself
do you ?
and with you .
it is , in the world
do you
i debate about whether it 's really good or not .
and maybe you do n't start looking .
over many , many years
that 's true .
that 's very true .
for you , all the things that you need work on and you need do this whole big
and then was one of the things we talked about with her
two a year
we have to do that now .
he is now and two ,
what it costs are now ridiculous ,
in that way , we know that is taken care of at least .
about other things
that approach ,
that is exactly what 's happening in my family .
it 's really ?
a little bit older
said this is what 's going to be available ,
there all this is going to do is to give you a little spending money
you 've got a scholarship .
that 's right .
that 's right .
that is to us what she said .
him go to a state college or a private college
our answer was , we will have money available and enough for him to attend a state college .
if he wants to go to a private college , and he can
and that was kind of our view on it .
it costs just too much ,
you just ca n't do it .
, so do n't know
it just amazing ,
just do n't know how anybody is going to do it
known
it and get really scary when you start talking .
and said
that i
and only two years behind
, do n't know
and said that is great
that 's right ,
that 's right .
think there 's some negatives ,
be some negatives anywhere
the first company really large
little privately owned small firms
never had the big benefit package so and
so really do n't know how to compare it to other big companies
never had anything even close to what they offered
have so
that 's fantastic ,
to most of our competitors
so think ?
and you can
.
it is now up to you
it is to speak menu selection , so .
that sounds really good .
a thing
, then you can purchase of vacation an extra week by saying
a set amount out of each paycheck
and they 're deducting it all along ,
you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time , so
you 're not really being paid for them ,
the money is coming out of your own pocket , actually
but it is coming out at a time instead of all at once a little bit .
so , is that they were interested in really
a compensatory standardized time for overtime to
and do n't believe that any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days , if they did , that
something like to one or five to one four
or maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one .
as a repayment for they should give me one day .
and
with that person you have
differences from one to the next about who got it and that does n't get it group
that 's and with a lot of things there that way .
in , and what you what you 're not going to get
that 's for sure .
which is
probably but then it is that way ,
is sure personalities that came into play always
the question was who are your opinion of youth spending a year or two in public service .
think that it would be a great idea
, do n't know
think that it would be a great idea , but
they want to be or do
other people at the same time
sure all countries and need help
for instance , everybody have what they called social year there they have
it and basically , high school education was a repayment
and most of them joined
it was done internally and .
there was
what they are about possibly where we are sending people off shore here
think that would be real interesting for people to do ,
but , i guess , my concern about that would be the cost
but do n't know
did n't know
do n't
of all age when the peace corps came in that
was too
seriously thought about joining at that time ,
thought it was a fantastic idea
sent off for stuff on it ,
but do n't remember that much
in the language you
you got actually
it was n't much ,
think so
where they could n't do that .
you might end up with a revolution .
do n't
that 's been interesting , though , the kids that have been over coming back right now .
, that 's not a bad way to do it ,
, from some of the guys
public
and this sort of thing
so you do n't have just a whole lot of , what we consider street crimes .
in china and stuff , there are virtually no such thing as rape
the public service thing again
it , or can be
people will kind of set up their own little club ,
that 's true .
might not go if it were voluntary ,
do n't know how they 'd enforce it , but
shoot them .
put them in jail
do n't know
because he was in it .
he thought that was great .
the rest of it was all wash hog ,
but that was great .
it seems like it would develop , if pride in people , it is in their own country .
appreciate here some of the things we have
it would take quite a few people .
maybe so that part of it would be helpful too .
do n't know
that brings up
who would determine what .
c c c was run by the army
, if it was n't people who were really fair and in a legal way or something ,
particular to one part of
be that part of town and that kind of thing
, that could n't it
they have
and they went
and they built a swimming pool or anything ,
one , you can build only , and
and did n't you build over here it .
that 's true .
unfair or something ,
it is one of those things on the surface it seems like a great idea .
heard about elephant foot soup
it is easy to do once a foot elephant .
it is the logistics of the thing that gets you going .
it seems like there 's a lot ,
you do n't hear much on the news about young people really wanting to do anything good or anything like that ,
and that kind of thing
instead of all these gangs kids could
but they did n't have anything the kids , could be doing , helping positive
they start out that
we ought to use them if they are willing to do it .
the logistics of the thing to
is going to run
what ,
how
and they have situations like that down there .
when they come back , and they 'd have to serve this year ,
and it turned out to be kind of a joke ,
always chose , because they did n't do anything
.
and they have all kinds of things , agricultural , and really good stuff that they could go into
them in it very slim , that your chance of having to do it was
there are men and also women , and
nearly as
once that have elderly couples
and they are all over the world .
and , it is incredible logistics ,
a training
the language and customs and all those kinds of things
that 's kind of a private organization , then
he had a direct connection , somewhere
he had an really in
things he would do with an airplane ,
are off
they do n't
but there is funding that comes ,
saving up on
and the church , helped them out some
but , you know , that it is incredible .
with credit cards to try to get maybe just one or two ,
do n't like having credit cards for every store
just do n't like them
of with them ?
is
is really afraid of spending too much
just do n't
they tempting at times
but sometimes just do n't
that can be very , very true .
just so you 'll spend money everybody and just give you a credit card
that 's the idea .
card at no charge for a whole year
that 's right .
they make money off of it .
pay , so you would be paying interest
that 's right .
that i use mine for groceries , for everything a great deal
is that
is that
just a
that 's all right .
sounds like you have a little one there .
have little ones two
you have .
old how
four and two and half
two very active ages
is like you
, do n't want to write a check
of the month the
never .
my husband , do at work to get out just cash
but take the checkbook
just tell him if so
and he got it out
and do n't even
do n't have to continue , in order to get cash
that 's right .
could n't he do without it , since he can do it , right there for nothing at work just
.
and they begin paying interest right from on that very day when .
you 're right .
and that 's
that is correct .
you 're defeating the purpose .
the idea is to use their money .
during that whole month , then and pay .
, sending me a credit card or calling on the phone me at least
do n't want it
you can do
is such a good credit risk that they can go and say
that 's their favorite word .
think so
you 're right .
no matter of credit cards where
wrapped up so in them and then , did n't
that much stuff
and then , they ca n't meet the minimum monthly payments on it .
one credit card and
costing just because if you ca n't make , you are paying interest , again
that 's right .
that 's right .
it 's been enjoyable talking .
seeing that somebody feel the same way ,
take good care .
take care of your little ones
too you
luck .
'll to you just hand it off
and
it 's relaxing .
you kind of and get
by the time so goes before .
sometimes else 's ears and just for my own satisfaction .
, is not that good at it
about how
so never have time to deal with them
photography a lot
is that
used to do that a lot
be here next week
that 's great ,
one , you know how that 's first .
i play about every night
really and
that sounds nice .
was in high school and college
and it is really a blast .
my wife , hate it
but that 's the way i guess , 's life .
that 's the hard part ?
together , if you can do things that helps really a lot .
she 's into aerobics ,
we did together for about a month and a half and aerobics
that 's good , too .
that went over real well , and
but that there are about it .
it 's good
and it is healthy , too .
too
we try to get twenty minutes at least three for four times a week .
that 's great .
that 's great .
we and , like
time
been twice out in this year so far
you could say an issue
and putting cabinets up and , those kind of things
that 's great , too .
when we bought a house , we did
and that kind of stuff in
that is fun .
it 's really kind of fun .
it is .
it 's really .
get in there with you
exactly .
like things that can do two people ,
of doing things
that kind of gives you some space for yourself ,
making the dolls and things , that
like doing things with my hands
like
you do
i love
i love
and then say , this is really good ,
it is .
in the garden , working around the yard , of course , working
sure
smoke them ,
and all that stuff
that stuff that 's all bad for you .
and that was great .
great , really
that 's only way to do it .
they have some nice stuff down there .
.
there are pluses to everything ,
but seems like there is just so many things to do down here ,
the sports
in fact , which my children were growing up , we have always horses
that was kind of for them , and
but they were n't interested in it as we were , as
we have always horses around ,
that really and
that 's great ,
did n't see that many of them
horses ?
n't really
you have to look real hard to see ,
, known
, known
it is true .
and a lot of people
that 's about it down here , and
but that is great .
you too
too you
look ,
it 's probably late for you ,
speaking with you
me too
have a good weekend .
, do n't know
do we push which
but
see 's
is their , opinion
and there is such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the united states
their , vote is not going to make that much difference
vote for one person or the other person , the issues are
since there are so many issues , this one person can believe a lot of different ways on , all of them
so , it would be difficult to have that perfect one person who believed exactly what you believed really .
that 's true ,
the party followers type
and just go in
the bad aspects of a candidate and .
that 's good .
but that did n't work .
pushing for more people to vote
they think if people more vote , they 'll get more votes each ?
the people come out that will vote for him
that 's true .
it is down women 's rights and that sort of movement , but
, is it and so
better than some of the other ones
that 's true .
and it does n't matter who they put in office , they 're going to fall subject to the pressure the lobbyists can put ,
and it 's real true that they 'll say ,
once , and then they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things they promised beforehand
was n't just thing at all in the first place like the no new taxes possible maybe
going the way it is , and everything with the economy was nearly ridiculous thing to , that even try to do
about that next year
to raise taxes
after the war
so they wo n't even bother turning out .
that 's true ,
we 'll see in four years you .
that 's what they keep saying it seems like people with old-fashioned values
turn out to vote ,
n't voted in years , but
neither has mine as a matter of fact .
and , that 's true ,
that 's true , not necessarily because that 's what the media says
the majority believe this way
so they do n't even bother turning out to vote to express their opinions .
so that 's true .
wonder if they 're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there is little children bouncing in your knee , the whole time you are talking .
do you hear the dogs in the background here ?
ca n't hear them
the children next door just opened the fence
and they went off .
long enough
that was and sort of interesting .
what part of the country
are
how they did get you ?
they went through engineering companies ,
and we 're communications .
i work in a company communications .
might be interesting and
sort of different
that was very strange .
they were doing standard eastern time
do n't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes
standard central time is what they 're doing it by .
the days zero through which yet day 's which six
but did n't study hard that it
'll maybe so figure it out
you and sort of
and , that was an interesting topic .
that guy to
.
right by the airport
we do so .
'll talk later to you
found out tonight
you found ?
have n't
that 's great .
think he deserves of it every pence
the money they are getting
is n't
a lot longer season and too .
and a lot more games ?
that is exactly right .
but
see 's
do n't even know who won the pennant last year
me beats .
though .
we have been talking ,
tried to call earlier ,
a list of all these baseball teams and the cities that they were from
started then cleaning
and do n't
it away
's see
think the a 's last year was in it
have you ever played baseball ?
were growing
that was fun .
that is fun .
that 's a whole different sport .
see 's
let 's see , and
do n't even remember his name either
like to go on the nights when there are not very many people out there
it 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd .
think it is fun ,
going out there during the day
it 's nice at night .
have been
it is .
and do you know anything about that new stadium ,
you seen have all those pictures that they 're going to put out there ?
it is to be a huge stadium
and it 's going to have little shopping centers in it , and a lake or something running through it
make it out there
and they 're going to let liquor in there never .
is they
, known
every year
they get every year and
you take it in there ,
but they do n't allow them to sell it there .
but that new stadium , is going to be real nice
heard that you can bid on that stadium and
heard that you could bid on the stadium to have , they said
and it 's going to go to the highest bidder .
that 's the way to do it .
you hear
that 's my kids turning on their music .
staying away from them .
could
i bet
are
?
what is
what do you do ?
i
?
for right now .
is trying to get out
that 's a tough system to be in ?
real hard ?
it is
like but it 's
and they get ,
and you get tired of that .
though that is typical bureaucracy .
is it
in just the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones ,
, do n't know
the smaller ones just as bad
but they ca n't be though ,
they do n't have as much money .
most of the time
but the politics get worse in the small towns sometimes .
there are so many of them .
you do n't
in a classroom somebody walk
when they are coming for you to do n't know what they are there
funny how
it 's just there
and they 're writing the whole time .
no communications
and not to say
known
and they 'll tell you that they have written down something ,
and hope they are telling you the truth
and never .
is that
it is .
that 's about ten too many .
my job 's good , much better than a lot now
reading long all day
and it 's just ten children at a time .
that 's not bad .
it 's good ,
and you 've got a lot of federal money , too .
n't it changed a lot over the years
.
or working in the system
a guide curriculum
we go and do n't have one .
we do n't even know where one 's .
and so
just what you wanted to do , , you did ,
funny how
and what days , what period and now and
you do n't know , which is worse .
which is worse
so guess .
being told what to do is worse .
are long
you can talk for ten minutes
but you do n't have to .
you can ?
and
you and say
have n't
and we started talking about gangs .
been right around here
but , she was real interesting .
and then this woman tonight , called
you taken had any incoming calls ?
hers was so
she was telling me all her problems , and
and it went over ten minutes .
you did talk not all about the topic at all ?
we did ,
was the topic
what would you if you were having a party dinner serve ?
about the other night
and stuff like that
could go on and on about that
too
go all the time
never goes to the guy ,
he was it sounds like you really is up on this .
said a week at least two
so , that was real good to talk .
go see
we talked about that one too .
should have gotten it ,
he thought it was too long
enjoyed it
did , too
it was just more for my money .
did n't think it was too long at all
he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch .
is the one other you need go see
your kids and ?
one is eight
it 's not too cool for kids .
they usually pick .
i bet
they 've got it all figured out .
they want to see the movies all horror .
most of the time really
do n't you ?
massive just
that 's a lot cheaper then taking out them to the show .
known
especially if you do n't have to watch them all in one time .
it 's just bad weather
of course , you have .
known
and they 're cheap
nobody yet got them
that 's true .
unbelievable .
that 's true .
we saw heroes always have been cowboys , tonight .
was
it was kind of slow ,
, do n't know
one of those movies it 's not going to be around long ,
it will be a movie dollar in no time .
you do read ?
not very much ,
do n't have the patience to read
that at night to make myself
my mom and dad
you saw field of dreams a long time ago ?
did
was reading the book ,
it was
like and then i
got a book of his short stories , so
and that 's been real good .
who is the author ?
do n't ask me .
it like the movie was ?
quite a bit
but in the movie , was the guy black
he was n't in the book ,
that is one difference .
there was n't really a lot of difference .
with that movie in
that is interesting .
that was a good movie , too .
do you think we covered baseball ?
think so .
have a good night
first you start
are presently living in a house ,
we have
, is this and so
like you wanted it ,
they are good for about five years or four years and
and after that they start falling apart .
but they are a cheap house .
if you ca n't afford good something ,
they are good for that ,
the rain off
in how your case
my husband , in my case is not a carpenter
but , in fact , he is in electronics ,
is the way we 'd have ever only if he would build
so it took him about two and a half years ,
but he built a house us ,
it 's a brick house , and
that way so we could
living in kind of a small town and
and it is nothing fancy ,
it 's a house ,
it 's nice ,
and it 's real pretty
and we 're
that 's great ,
that 's great ,
another guy is building one now , as a matter of fact
he 's been doing it for three years
and the city 's
by doing that you save off a lot of money ,
because that way you 're not having to pay the middle men and everybody else you can
with that nothing
you know .
my brother , is a trim carpenter
for us the
and that helped .
that was a big savings .
we hire the plumbing and the brick and everything else
he did everything else .
we 've been six years in it .
that 's great .
you long to be in it
kind of small still now
we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it ,
,
first one 's always a bear .
we are having an architect friend of mine for us a house design
can and that
and told him , what all we wanted
and he is charging us about a buck a square foot design it
and and
fall in or something if
your approach is right ,
and that 's
talking to i file and in little my book .
that 's great ,
that 's great .
if we have n't did it ourselves we have
can imagine
but it 's ours .
if you 're happy with it , is that all that counts .
that 's right .
that 's right .
that 's all ,
you have only to satisfy yourself and no one else .
the appraisers apparently like it because sure our taxes are high .
if that 's .
it is n't ?
it 's really
is always
i think , my goodness .
that 's great .
about it does
and it was nice talking to you .
with you , too .
is living off my dad ,
, for everything is pretty rough ,
but he controls part that
control how much spending there is
my money is just food and
what about tuition and rent ?
who take care of that ?
the or even before starts school
and then the tuition is also the same thing
and that 's about it .
you want to go to a restaurant or something
you ca n't do that very often .
can spend that money
but it 's not
to school
because is a foreign student
the government and so does n't allow me to work .
all the money so comes from home .
in your monthly spending
the thing is
my money all out of the teller
besides one of my biggest expenses
where do you to call ?
too much money on phone bills
too long
me called down every so often there
told my dad , dad
wo n't so often called , if
we want to keep in touch
so does n't matter about the money because we need hear you from
you so called
because it 's more expensive that way .
so what makes you ?
the united states are basically the cheapest country to call out of .
a in other countries
you just called him direct
the bill and ?
got money to pay that , too
it 's too much money , not
it 's too little money , and not
a letter to him , or something
because he wants to concentrate on my studies really me .
are
masters in
and what do you think you 'll do with that ?
degrees with those
can work here up to a year
a job after that and .
you want to get into some kind of manufacturing ,
that you 're looking
computer communications and transmissions data .
you want to find , so
you 're looking for long distance type stuff .
anywhere from local area networks , metropolitan area networks all that
and so you have a family ?
have a wife and two children
does your wife and work ?
she does n't work ,
it is kind of hard to say now days ,
she and get paid for that
so she bring in some money .
on a full time basis here in town that
and you have a monthly budget ?
sort of .
in that i guess , we know that
and we know
we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with the monthly budget , and
we 're like everybody else ,
that 's when everybody goes crazy .
one of the i points which then that 's , do n't see
and do n't like to give any at all
'll ask somebody , if
that is something that you can use .
knew he needed an alarm clock and
bought him an alarm clock so
that is great .
necessary things , no frivolous gifts
going out once a year
all this money on all these people
you do n't care about ,
that 's true ,
why
in a lot of frivolous gift
finals and lots of
for example , we have now break spring ,
and went
spent , two hundred dollars around and maybe
so .
got , though , that
save up to do that in
, we let 's go before break spring eat out
out , breaking spring before
how much money
.
wo n't go out and then , if
my roommate went home , and so
it was worth it ,
it is sure ,
it was a nice place .
and you do n't have a car
the
's see how long have we been talking here
six minutes and a half
's ?
to you .
to you .
have a good time .
of quite a
do n't know if it is the dust saw or the mess you make or the smell of the wood
it is more like the mess you make
about cleaning up it
because it is out there .
about getting except when i track in dust saw on the carpet stuff
the wife , and get kind of aggravated about that
get , but then
some of both
you like to do your things
she happened to be doing ,
'd help her with that so
have much opportunity to work
trying to start a business up
a good time for
it 's been beautiful this last week
could do with a little less wind ,
the temperature been pretty good so far for working outside
usually starting in the fall .
that 's kind of what my wife says .
got something to cover her legs and feet
of brothers and sisters then a
they take some time to make .
found one that 's real easy ,
ca n't even remember the name of it now ,
but in strips you make it .
and it 's real easy to do ,
keep your feet quite as
a mile
that 's the name of it .
a mile
a mile
is sure what she does not
, is n't it
, known
we have a problem with our connection
we have a very small phone company down here .
instead of call waiting or call .
we ca n't have that down here .
all the time
that is one way to end a conversation
it gets
have got kids all over the united states
is talking to them
have you started yet your garden ?
did get in there ,
got to have those
last year had four jalapeno plants
think one of them , died
can eat all of those
like nobody else in the family ,
but always got
my husband , do n't like them either
but can always give them away
kind of
they is fun to grow .
planted hills four of them
had three or four seeds in each one of them ,
those things just flat and took over .
it was n't until ,
maybe it was because it was too dry ,
a good time to plant those is , if
, would think so
seems like they went to leaf , all
in the summer they started making fruit
you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon ,
it may not be ,
it may not be .
you think they are later in the year
that 's true .
to go ahead .
is
to go ahead .
, it 's a little over six or seven minutes
that would be fine .
just any time
for
talking to you
have a good time .
come out ,
so ,
but is not a chemist
from industrial areas , factories
, do n't really know
understand very well
were in fact , and
like peanut butter
and so on
a few years ago , and that was ?
this was quite a few years ago .
people say it is somewhat better .
and particularly in the winter months .
shutting down , if it
it did burn coal ?
do n't know
the information , is one of those kind of pieces of news wire services ,
so it 's hard ,
never did see the full story ,
so do n't know
that is such a spectacle .
it would be a shame to ruin it .
individuals could do or
do n't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals
and thing that sort of all
do n't know what we can do as individuals from that apart
what do you think we can do ?
you think it 's more to society .
i kind
there is n't a lot we can do about a lot of things on an individual basis
if we can then , but certainly
do think we have a responsibility there and
is not always real
back down on some of the air pollution standards much too much
lobbyist and the car manufacturing companies
all those restrictions really too hard
we ca n't make quite
still living and then .
suspect that is that one thing
think we can do more as a society , but
being responsible in order to be group responsible individually
air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that is necessary to get rid of the source of it
suspect that there are going to have to be a lot of pressure
and probably be the only way what can happen
and do n't know how long that will take
people also have to realize they ca n't have and eat it .
so , if you do n't want to burn coal for power , about how nuclear energy .
we do n't want that either .
in the sun
if really came
it 's just the same thing with the gasoline ,
is the government and not yet
and they do n't want to pay for it .
billions of dollars
have other causes
certainly oil was a big factor .
think that 's probably going to happen with such things as air pollution , and
then maybe we 'll have a little bit of help when we get serious about our motors in our automobiles .
you do have any in your area air pollution ?
once we 'll get some , in
and so on
is that
but it 's not very usual
the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities
we really do n't have that either .
the comfort particularly in the summer
seems to me
growing problem
we covered everything we need to here
we have given them according to my watch about seven minutes
it was nice talking .
and enjoyed the conversation
did so
have long you lived in this area ?
of years a
a lot than it
before we have ice and snow ,
storm ice around this time of the year .
this year and it is
it 's quite really amazing .
and it was the first day of spring ,
ice so much that , came down , later on that afternoon and evening
it was horrible .
was talking just today ,
he he could be here , rather than
do n't know
, like
like it
but it does n't really matter .
cool at this time of year because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
it 's really
most of my time in weather warm areas
the ice and snow and just do n't hold any allure for me at all .
is not so
got used to it , but
it was really strange ,
and then we got used to it
it 's not that it 's just hot or dry ,
it 's just not very comfortable ,
a little bit
we were down there
right before we left the last day and had
and the air conditioning , went out on the car
conditioning all the time
and it was just killing us .
it is terrible .
that 's really bad .
just so
you 're sweating ,
down look at your arm
the water leaving your arm
it 's so hot
bizarre .
the change of the seasons
so , it 's
agree
, but do n't know
it probably more tolerable in
as some of the others we might have gotten as a topic
got one topic ,
had some pretty controversial topics
so it 's just my fault that was .
it gets
you can only talk so long just about the situation .
, known
just that not all
it 's nice talking .
, and would
and be able to do these fantastic in space things
now they have a new one .
always like show that the very best probably
with the characters
the movies too good
kind of along the same line and .
started thinking about this
of that show
you have n't
and what is he ?
so he do all kinds of strange things like that .
see what we can come up with .
and used to very much like the show
some of the little things
and just decided
i thought , in part
sort of
did n't get the booze out of the house
ever had any trouble with that
have my favorite shows
usually and make time in my day or my week to watch those
have small kids , but for the most part ,
really when they are up on just a minimum amount of time
that well real
do n't
that would be a shame .
have n't seen the electric company in a long time
but they 're not making new ones .
have n't seen in a long time it
he 's still around ?
do n't think he is making new ones ,
the old ones all but .
.
.
so that are still a real good show too
and and ready to go ,
, what is on
i figure your children
have little ones two
they like so .
being in the afternoon on
they come on both .
and from five to six
without under foot them to do
is not sure it was that great for my children ,
turned out , but they
it did n't hurt them any .
for the imagination of it all
watching some of it can be a little violent and sometimes stuff for kids .
my little ones
what we can do
this will be possible in perhaps .
of thing
ever had a favorite one at one time even
see 's
about how man from uncle ?
always he got
that is impossible mission .
that 's right ,
impossible mission
used to watch that
can still in fact
thought those was very good
have seen some of them on repeats
they always had a good plot .
, on what was going to happen
they are going .
do remember that
the doors of days a
and it was very , very funny .
, do n't know
's old not enough to recall that one
have , i guess
.
was really little
may
they would n't let
had catch them all on repeats
they thought that was violent too much for small children .
watching a lot of these things on in the afternoons or something repeats ended up
that is interesting .
violence from tv
so maybe even .
that is a different topic
probably .
covered it for me ,
and we 'll talk perhaps another timing .
it was nice talking .
tell me where you are calling from .
from
did n't know they did it long distance
they do it all over the country , because they need collect all kinds of different dialects
it was nice talking .
same here
think we are supposed to discuss our view of the soviet union as a continuing threat to the united states
how do you feel about that
would n't consider to be a threat at all
much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore
are worried about them
as a burden is not as a military threat concerned about them
they are very large
think that 's a real important aspect
see 's
is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a reality
the people there have money ,
that 's not their problem ,
but there is no for them to buy food ,
you ca n't eat money .
and they have , a problem , their whole attitude ,
, is not sure which crop it was
because in the fields
why was saying the people in the city
the government
that 's not my job .
a lot of
but they do n't know how to act yet .
they do n't understand some responsibility for themselves .
it 's not just the government 's responsibility anymore .
you ca n't just blame it on the government
when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself as well that then put
think they are having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back and
only going forward
are expecting a call
is it came through
talking to you
thank you ,
the last few days , one of their young hopeless stars
it was a catcher .
they do n't really and
they are not around the highest paying ball team .
is not
would , too
, even
that 's right .
, take
when he was in high school , he enjoyed
think , but they 're doing better
to
can imagine
was a kid
we 're heavy into that too .
think it is fun more to play than it is watch
, too , .
of course ,
of course .
this morning in the sports page
just a day or so ago
full five innings and .
of for a pitcher to start out strong that
no big deal ,
it 's just part of a day 's work .
, known
he is something else ,
he is really .
they could do very well ,
sure they could .
do n't know
figured just because of all the publicity and everything they were under a lot of pressure , but
really .
all their players
some of them too happy about it
at least , that should help ,
that should help .
it should sure .
it should .
and of course , there are also
really .
sure .
that 's right .
you have n't
have a few times
they are a good ball team .
that 's right .
really .
sure .
would
tell
that would draw a crowd , would n't it .
would
it would sure .
we might actually get to go to a world series .
that 's right ,
would n't be something that
it would sure .
is that
there is sure
really they and .
sure he did get in a slump
but , they 're saying this year 's their predictions
, he is n't he
though , is n't he
he is really
he is sure .
hit home run
that 's right .
ever for him not there is a in between
that 's right ,
of this year the
and they are not sure they 're going to be able to sign him again .
to sign again him
or that may not happen
you never know .
that 's right ,
it 's a long way away .
is sure they 'll do a little bit of everything if
that 's right .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
.
there are going to be a ticket increase this year ,
do you know .
had n't
either , have n't
, have n't really
those cowboys again this year increased their prices
, but did n't know
or do n't
either , have n't
we have n't ,
about sending the schedules out yet even
it 's too early
because we usually get .
usually in advance .
it 's a good idea ,
we try to so often go .
they get if you have young children .
.
talking to you
and hopefully , we 'll get talk again .
you take care .
you said you 've cats four ?
have cats four
old how
they range from about a year and a half to nine years old .
have one my oldest quite nine years
have him probably five years
you get
my cats
lost one , one time
one the first
and he 'd never been outside outside by himself .
had a child
, known
searching for this cat
i
they laughed at me , and
,
through the same things with ours
they have been ill ,
care of my cats
is absolutely crazy
and then we have a baby
and it is that comes first
the cat or the baby
the cat was here first
, known
it 's hard .
with us and then there 's
funny how
it is , whose corners is this one .
that 's sweet ,
, have the two
the other two cats
they did n't , and
and they were n't doing very well inside ,
got a house
and they 're doing great out there ,
.
he does n't want to do with outside unless you there is anything but
other than that he got
if he goes into hiding .
that 's it .
he is probably been through all kinds of nightmares .
for life here
all four of ours
.
we started with two outdoor cats out
he did n't like cats
he lived through it ,
could n't believe it
the cat died , almost
but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat ,
now he love life .
i
and he is so much thank you .
, when that happened
, known
about that
but that was too for us a traumatic experience .
can imagine ,
with what did he
and then he started with a bull whip chasing him .
people crazy
absolutely
and it took us out of the vet and surgery in
as he started off
and then we did all this for him .
but he 's been a wonderful cat .
i
usually after something like them that happens to .
them or something
do n't see without pets us , without cats
this void
ca n't take because they are outside , as well
one day one of them , wo n't come back
feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things and .
ca n't give them up , but
about who are taking care of them
every time on
my husband was such a sucker for animals until
had we to put
and my husband just died .
it was we ca n't take back it
keep it now
it is now here ,
we have to keep it .
just move away from home
two weeks , when to realize ,
so found this one
that is interesting ,
'll call them
and he was
and he was the last one she , carried across
the sad big whole story
have so take him of course
for him after that so
asked the vet why he did that
n't even
but he does n't bite anybody
that 's good .
just .
'll come up
's kneading bread
it just drives nuts us .
just .
, like
they are
lived at home
but they 're actually a lot more than cats trouble .
really .
the cats independent so
and they have so much more than a dog personality .
.
but they are so much fun to watch them play .
.
,
get more than one cat together , because it bring out their personalities
and they just act so funny .
outside , they are like brothers , the two were
have never seen cats two so close
through the house
the two other cats will follow in pursuit and then .
it 's like this training .
a training of cats running around .
it sounds like a train .
we have wooden floors
through the house
funny ,
can imagine
would n't give anything for my cats
to death .
they are
your cats 's names
how sweet
and what you have .
they do n't and
.
, is a medium hair yellow cat
.
they do n't
not a thing
and they came from the same litter , and everything .
and she is
she is so
you ca n't help but love her .
and she is right there .
she is the oldest one ?
she is the oldest .
also moved out of the house
so
if something happens to her .
known
of the world the
it will be .
you get
my mother have dogs
and is no
this is nothing like cats .
you can walk a dog
and that 's
cats good all the time
if he were a person dog it would n't
it would n't have ,
that would be a problem .
is that
like cats
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date
and there were all cats hanging over him .
had they
was and
he said , of course i love cats .
, the whole yards nine
it was so funny .
you getting rid of your cats
you getting rid of your cats
ca n't be pregnant
is
watch me .
the child will learn to like cats .
is
we getting rid of the cats
either would n't
'd be no way
was the whole family
that 's life ,
that 's how life goes .
but
just to death .
, known
i love too
it 's been nice talking .
it was nice talking to you too ,
enjoyed it
to
awful how
it was truly awful .
it was not
some interesting things about
because the characters was
a mental picture of it and of the few good things that was in it
and it was .
had a lot of it
rather
two of them
the man rain was one .
that was great one .
was n't
loved it
, have n't seen
it and .
you need see that .
and took all this
bet
especially in
and it was really a fantastic movie .
was
, it did n't it
that 's right .
it might have one best picture , too .
it did ,
it did .
that was ,
it must have been great just being with him on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his lines and all that stuff .
believe better
that was so funny ,
that was
unbelievable .
feel and everyone
that 's right .
but there 's a lots going on in there .
it 's amazing .
it was a picture of relationships and again .
the relationship between the two that would never again
with that movie so
saw it three times
you did .
so much tell you just about that movie , because it really rang a lot of my personal background
have a brother is that older myself
nothing , serious is wrong with him
but we have gone through these lapses of a relationship , sometimes ,
and then we get back and forth for no direct real reason
aspect of the movie between the brothers
that was
that is tremendous ,
it 's good because it does make you think , about your own family .
a lot .
and it did bring out a lot of between you and your brother thoughts .
no question ,
he is one of these guys though that do n't really like to go see .
like them up the bang
teeth go get him to see it
have heard him give
he saw it only one time ,
he did n't go for more back , and
but he said he enjoyed it
at least one time he saw it .
, do n't know
be came on
he will do that , to research it and be able to mimic with the kinds of problems that he had a person .
was
do n't know about any body else
it was great .
was everybody who saw it
he did great .
it 's just
up there
absolutely
is ready for it ,
but they are predicting some snow more for our direction .
take care .
take care .
our community do n't really have .
where do you live ?
a big recycling real
a lot of the communities doing
so , they 're really not full force into it ,
's , but
we are attempting it , so
we could do more
for the company power here
about building a generation garbage burning electric plant
but it was n't just effective cost , at the time .
there is little recycling trucks and things throughout the city and
but there is n't any advertising campaign .
is that
but they make it hard as as possible ,
not very convenient
think is one of the best things is those cash for cans
do n't know if you have all those things around
and like that because
and you can just stop by .
you still have to go to the centers
that are real nice
and started doing at work that
for people to put their aluminum cans in a trash
, helped really a lot
are everybody
them to walk little bit put farther rather than
really like that
people but
sometimes because , it is not the right people , which is really , really sad
we started at work all the recycling stuff .
is they really
think what started at work it last year was earth planet thing we have
that started a lot of off stuff really , and ,
that 's good .
but that is about the extent of it .
at least you are trying something .
it would be nice if it could be more .
is the driving factor for recycling the paper computer
really do you .
we sell the paper back to a manufacturing paper company .
that 's a neat idea .
by not much ,
that 's really good ,
is they at least
and do n't understand this
and here .
and do n't understand , sometimes , the logic behind it
someone moved offices in my building
is moving pretty soon
and they are good boxes .
is that
and they were just going to throw them away .
, did
exactly .
did n't want to waste that
and it 's hard enough to find .
you can
they do n't take up so much storage space .
that 's very good .
taking until the boxes for about two seconds
was doing a favor them by taking them
the grocery store and stuff to
the grocery store , half the time
so you ca n't use it anyway .
scouting out the copy is constantly room for those boxes and
is that
perfect boxes to put in files
they are good for storage and stuff like that .
or of clothes season in them
and they 're just perfect .
, do n't have now
and leave them out and put things , even in them
and they look just as good .
that 's a smart idea .
'll have to try that
that are really
ready with little the design on them all
they are the exact same thing .
is that
they just made .
some money
are you and
is that
for newspaper , but
ours real hard to find
that is the one thing that really discourage me .
they do n't pay , at all ,
they are real hard to find that pay the places .
and that is really
the regular place
think , but they should
the
it to get people , doing it ,
you do n't have to pay them a lot .
think there 's two of them , that have in several openings ,
and it is for recycling
and some other category
maybe there is
you do n't and
that 's good .
we have two different trash cans at your desk at work .
you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash ,
one in the paper you 've but
you do n't throw away any of the slick paper , like magazines
you ca n't throw any of that away
and you ca n't throw away certain type things filing ,
, would be easy to take all it
, do n't know
do n't of course
of having to separate paper
you make it a habit
to doing it that it 's a habit
and your empty trash
every other day
and every other day .
we are running late ,
thinking that you are working to separate it sitting there
someone else is n't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags and .
they start keeping an eye out for those
separate them
is that
to those two different trash cans
and they 'll start separating them .
, do n't mind doing that
are doing something
talking to you
too you
,
that the last movie
do n't go to that many
about the ones that went ,
have you seen it .
unfortunately , have n't
is really good ,
it is .
've ever seen
them back more or less
it but off .
where he ca n't control his movements at all
and it was just so realistic .
that he is an actor
he does have a funny part in it ?
how he does do serious
he is good ,
he is .
only have seen in funny stuff
, known
me too
what was that show , but
but that was n't it .
was n't always in that show
, did n't see the movie
the book
did too
was thinking that it could n't be a totally funny just part
in fact , it got some pretty serious deep in it parts
what have you seen ?
saw it
we have seen one both .
cry through it ?
the whole way .
it was telling a friend ,
each long , but was about half an hour
where did you cry .
see 's
thought and from there on , all the way through the movie .
's
what other parts
ca n't remember any of the other parts off right now
the horse got
when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him .
, is an animal lover
you can hear my dog .
unfortunately we do n't have any animals ,
it was a beautiful story ,
it was really .
there was a lot of too pretty scenery in that movie .
it was
that was ,
had n't
now to eat of course .
it was n't .
that was great .
and there were so many of them .
did n't know that
that was pretty .
think and about how it just changed the whole landscape ,
could follow you ,
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes , and that sort of thing .
kept with them
known
though they graze
that would n't be a problem .
have you seen any of the behind the scenes of that movie .
they tried to keep it very close to real .
was wolves
what ,
that much howl
that 'll teach them in a couple minutes .
and that 's all they 'd have to do .
that 's funny .
have
is that five minutes ,
, do n't know
it five or three 's .
is not sure
is not either
, though
me too
for called
thank you .
too you
back by that
so many ramifications to
look at them ,
heads of
keep some day a woman will be president and
have some question , but whether they will ever , or not really get around to that
think we 'll have a black president before we have a president women
and do n't know whether that is bad or good ,
we address the racial issues in the united states , before we can go anywhere
think we are supposed to hang up
it was n't the matter of wealth ,
the matter that they were not wealthy ,
'll talk later ,
thank you .
tell me
it 's hard to say .
anything men can do in this sort of scale of things have much effect at all .
what do you think ?
probably the greatest cause are vehicles , especially around cities
do you live right in the city itself ?
, is more out in the suburbs
certainly work but near a city .
about how you ?
living in a rural area .
it is mainly farms and no heavy industry .
.
and , it 's
up in the northeast corner
but there is n't a lot of heavy industry .
there are the freeways
so we 'll pick up that .
about twenty miles away from the state airport
the fly patterns of the jets now getting bigger
and , it seems like we 're catching that all residue .
have the emissions from the power plants , but
the coal
there does n't seem to be much emission from them ,
's , but not sure about the rest of the country
it is interesting
is
people in the morning in that neighborhood up
during the night seems like they 'd blow their stacks from the warehouses , for powerhouses , off
that at night too
all over them and .
so , you 're right ,
they could do something about that , i guess .
that seems
are
they have been getting cleaner .
they have
but
directly to the air pollution , other than acid rain
rain
recently review technology in indicate basically acid rain may be a little bit
is not
up here ?
have n't
some of it does
some of it runs and
and some of the fishing was supposedly making a comeback .
ca
read
ca n't remember
thought it was up there , but
you kind of think it 's something else then
that 's what this article .
, did n't say though they
they did n't say what ,
that it may be natural other things at work .
disease
so it is less than clear .
do n't remember the article well that
, but do n't know
what do you think we can as individuals or as a group
we can demand for one thing more efficient automobiles .
still think that 's , one of our major causes of pollutants
go about that it 's a difficult little bit .
new vehicles , though , is a big problem .
the new cars and is , hardly anything .
they are better ,
about how the trucks and buses that all but out there .
they 're out
is not really sure
fuel is one of their biggest costs .
diesel engines but
diesel engines
they do generate a lot of soot
we could also push for legislation for rapid transit systems .
a little on that
most people do n't use because it 's so inconvenient rapid transit on the other hand .
but only because we got used to single person , single car , driving .
that 'll help , air pollution ,
that is so helping .
what do you think about a device , a right on a tail pipe meter
you pay and you on how much ?
that 's an idea .
will every city and town
if you do n't have to pay any tax
you just or buy one of these things
maybe you could probably devise so it closed off your tail pipe slowly them
the you and longer the less
if your tail pipe and then it closed off
and you could n't start your car anymore .
that 's an interesting concept .
that 's your idea ?
obviously somebody could take just right off the tail pipe again
you would probably have to build right into the muffler or something so it .
like a catalytic converter
you could take too off
into every muffler
that 's quite a concept .
you should pursue that or patent it .
,
that 's a good idea .
if you could come up with a device that 's the thing .
but it should n't be too hard to do something like that .
but that 's
you 're right
and that will solve a lot of problems .
if you approached the automobile industry
you might generate some interest in it .
the automobile regulatory agencies or something
but that 's a good idea .
through a group or an organization
you do
like to eat
because a lot of it is one meals dish , type things , and they 're kind of convenient
you do n't have to deal with different things , coming at once out eight
cook usually when you have a party .
usually have smaller groups
so
i guess
heavy sauces
that sounds good .
.
how about you ,
you do
we 're talking ,
we have just a party dinner
our senior pastor and his wife came over .
is the only thing , though ,
so it was n't
there are salad and
but it 's real hard to make them .
do n't
do n't
is that
is just real neat stuff like that
it 's really good ,
catered to their diet , but instead
and it was good and everything ,
it had in it all the vegetables ,
it .
is , if they 're on a diet like that
came over a couple weeks later
did what make that night .
a roast
ca n't believe
broke my husband
ca n't believe that
like that during the week
just it but when we are having guests , we just kind of say .
we have extra crust with it , and
it was
that sounds good .
but do n't think we gained any weight from it
the same way
they do n't want the extra calories ,
dessert sometimes be the only thing that i kind of play down
and she did n't eat it .
that 's good .
that did when
you want to say about it
comes right off
guess not so .
it was nice talking .
too you
an interesting article in
and he took the course
or he left
that 's right .
and it was very interesting how he did it
, is an air force officer and
so it was interesting for me ,
mine from the air
that went over there
and they are getting a tremendous amount of support out of it .
that 's great ,
if the vote in the congress to authorize war , if necessary , were actually pretty close .
it was .
do n't know the exact figure
almost certainly would have to be
that 's right .
especially the ones came out and said come on guys , let 's
we going to wait
over there in the mean time
no doubt .
whether we should wait longer ,
but know there 's a lot of reasons to wait longer
we concerned about their military capability
think we over , estimated it and
, concerned about it highly
think so too .
was and
they were ,
and they were in fact
it is true
it probably would have we done a frontal assault
that 's right ,
that 's true .
that is interesting ,
interesting .
hear at one time that
is he and now ,
and that greatly concerns me .
that i support
think that 's a positive thing for them , after thousands of years
, was n't going to take anymore they
they did n't have much choice ,
they could either fight or die .
so
my training of
so ,
'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region
for this desert shield and desert storm thing ended
it 's a positive thing ,
basically , have you and so
and are not sure just that there are going to be any permanent easy solution
they up becoming divisive themselves .
it is interesting ,
it is .
is looking forward
, known
that is absolutely unprecedented
an incredible foreign policy on the part of the president and the state department
never happened before ,
and do n't know if it will ever happen again
may not .
it 's been fun ,
talking with you
maybe the computer will pair up us together
you never know .
your music interests
just about any kind of music except rock acid ,
do n't care , for rock acid ,
too
grew up , but
did too
any kind of music
classical music
is too
do n't like rock acid either
up in a small town
so we have only one radio station
so it was country music ,
you 're
we do n't get two channel .
our cable , does n't
that we got ,
is that
it was ?
we do n't get two channel .
and it was tremendous .
actually did ,
his too
it was
he is really good .
come from a musical background ,
a big appreciation for
do n't like much of the new stuff that 's coming out ,
is getting old
do you ?
lay back on the couch
that is nice to do that is .
play an instrument in my life
always too
me learn the piano or something
but 'd love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out just
the forced ones
could do that never
was never
but .
's music in
that at church too
have n't done in a long time that
see 's
what kind of music do you not like ?
the rock acid
do n't care for music rap either
that 's not music ,
that 's not ,
, do n't know what is that
but that 's not music .
do n't want to listen to it if
it 's not music ,
talking in
it is not at all exciting
it does n't give you relaxation ,
you ca n't dance to it ,
you ca n't do anything to it .
like and
have you ?
are
they are good .
are
have been , never
the music in that was fantastic .
was hard to get tickets
ca n't remember in advance , tickets we reserved how far
but it was at the state music fair hall out
and it was well worth the price .
it was ?
bet it was ,
bet it was
so often a real good one like that one
that would be nice .
saw babies sugar ,
that was good ,
that have good music in it .
it was ?
do n't know about what is that
what is not that old real dancer ,
ca n't think of her name
got it right on the tip of my tongue
what you 're , about
long real legs and dark hair
she 's got black hair ,
what you 're about
ca n't think either ever her name
ca n't think of it
being here a few years ago
the country last music ,
really like country , music still
my husband like real well country music
and
a bit over
, either have never
show , too
just do n't care for him , but
just have never
it is ?
who is that
some of his records , my parents have
had some
sold some of them ,
do n't know if you were old enough to remember him
heard
he played in the western old movies .
have never
back quite a way going
was able to get a little money for them
but my mother and dad use to own a restaurant ,
it 's hard ,
the guy when they would come and change would give her the old records and
is that
out too , at the time
there is not ?
you 'd think there would be .
not the problem is most of the record players
that 's true .
that 's a shame
going to antique stores a lot
is sure you could find
but that would cost a fortune , if you could find them that worked .
those things were big
you could kill somebody with them .
warped easy real
is just so thin
they are meant to last , at all , and not
tapes
we buy cassette tapes ,
machines , and will eat them
so the best bet , these days and
so that 's all you have to listen to
radio .
that 's just what you have ,
think it was back to better ,
the radio , is more exciting , really , than television and
it on the radio was every week ?
what days , were on that
you can
what do you think about the idea of having volunteer for everyone service ?
think that it would n't really hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service
and there have been so many people who have done it
have and
and think they 've got a lot out of it
you doing any kind of volunteer work now
right now , not
have done red cross work , but
when people would do it ,
when they finished high school ?
as they finished high school it would
were in fact
think there 's a real challenge there and
whether you 're really ready , there are also this issue of
think it gives a different perspective and
, more than someone who just goes right straight into college if
the only complication is how do you something like this fund ?
a lot of parents
some groups have their children go away for a year
even the religious organizations
them for the whole year , year and a half that they 're gone and .
it is interesting .
get them away from home
were we
to something that will give them a job as
either a military mandatory
do you think that would be reasonable ?
think that it would
was
feel if the men and personally .
what would have them do you ?
there 's a lot of unemployment right now .
if they were brought in
what ,
into the service ?
it was
my father was in the c c c .
he was in that ?
it is not the best thing in the world ,
but it gave them something to do .
it seems that there is some things like the programs .
the more depressed areas
in fact , we , helped with help to help humanities
that was a good experience , and
but you take out the kids
it would be a good idea .
we 've been doing this three or four minutes .
you do have any other comments further ?
not really .
'll talk later to you
have a good night
where to start
had that much , of course
just
had that much time to think about it , either
your credit rating at
that 's true .
did n't think about that
permits and of course , of course , using your social security number
now , a social security number
is of course , and in another aspect of this
just thought about it ,
to one or more professional organizations
think is an invasion of privacy
.
some of these things in the mail that i wonder , which in the world did they get
filling out when one
got where it ask all that salary information and everything , yet
have a real hard time doing
you send something with your name and address and what types of things off
not only that , and
it opens you to phone solicitations
sat down to eat dinner ,
carpet
have
had them of course , for real estate investments
you get send in this particular card
a free trip or something along those lines and .
a lot of these
going through the book phone
some of them sold
one particular group to
and they have for some , reason for me three different names .
is the address
my office address
my first name
then they have a third one under my just two initials .
mail and at home under each of those names get here .
so know
as far as an invasion of privacy
the phone number the worst part
it 's one thing to get because you can put it right in the trash , just junk mail
but it 's the phone calls ,
down to dinner because they know you are at work all day pretty much
home from work and .
you but if it 's a salesperson , it 's just do
and have lately got
sometimes come home from work
hung ups on
a salesman called during the day
was n't home , and
down to dinner later on
the stuff mail
as the phone calls nearly as
called even if
you cutting off the phone
might get an important phone call ,
is
come home from work
need balance my checking account ,
need do all kinds of different things like that ,
even though and just like , this is my quiet time , feel
need get things to do
nice , because they 'll leave a message if it 's really important
can call them back and
that 's right .
have many phone calls from customers
rings phone like
and you come home
and is to have to answer the phone
if it is some salesman , and just that makes it even worse that much
let it pick the phone
now we have a voice mail system at the office .
a ring at all
that 's an idea .
will let the ring phone three or four times just
and it makes it so convenient .
can you just route on most systems and
ours is that way , too .
and that 's when
that 's it ,
that 's what we have .
knew that there were some type of a tie in there
think we did ,
that 's good .
did n't think we could go too far on this thing privacy ,
it is close enough
for called
talking to you
take care .
you want to start
first identify myself as
it gives me a perspective on that
happen recently in the place work to both in society women
a significant change both participated
,
you see women and going off to wars as well as men .
why both the father and mother going
the children and .
that 's kind of a drawback to me .
it is
being brought in the day centers care up
wonder about them in what way ?
from what .
more
they contentious much more
have much experience , with children in that situation
my experience is just with what we did
so they really did n't go through the route child care and
they were able to be home together .
and we experienced that never actually .
to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so
just do n't know
what do you mean ?
one might conceive of the possibility that there might be a kind of a professional mother , person .
that 's strange .
and could
have a philosophical problem with that
that 's right ,
that 's right .
relative to being a mother or not
very much have an interest
necessarily with the necessity to have
, do n't have
that did n't bother me ,
never
care days to
it would be a sort of care days ,
but it would
to come in and live with them ?
could easily envision that
to come in and live with them ?
was going to be kids four other
and you were paying for really high quality care .
more of people like that with an opportunity is a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
a day care
the day centers care not cheap either
have n't really ever looked at them
you at all , of what they cost aware
single several mothers absolutely ca n't afford it
on and taking care of the children
that 's just a rate that you have to pay
really do n't have a vision
that is , too .
thought that they will be more in the place work because is the door open .
and it 's just human nature through an open door to walk .
and would be glad to see that
is running across single women all the time
and that 's a little troublesome .
it is awful .
and that 's a change that we 'll see maybe .
, perhaps to take care of the children , in the event of a separation
think we 've done it
think we 're to do about
thank very much you
it 's been interesting .
you take care .
what do you think about the idea of kids having to do public service work for a year ?
think it 's a pretty good idea
or helping elderly people
think we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
and are not sure that 's not a bad idea
that 's true .
think it teach kids how to grow
about how
with you .
and they did , do a lot of public service activities ,
parents encouraging their kids to do things like that
that 's really great .
they
ten or twelve years
.
and they do n't follow at all it .
senior
,
, not just do it anymore
interest
are even less interest there
.
grab , grab , grab walk out .
you 're absolutely right .
think it 's really a good thing
of course , there 's third world countries that can use all kind of help .
but there 's a lot that can be done in this country right here , too .
think we ought to start right at home here , but
not so sure helping overseas would be such a hot idea
we really address what we 've done here
a month perhaps even then overseas tour six
it 's been really good .
about this for a few minutes
good topic maybe another call other
but do n't really have too much more on this topic , i guess to say
with you .
we agree that it 's a good thing , they should do sometime both
you take care ,
and the day
too
too
how do you keep up with current events usually ?
a news magazine once a week
do you ,
read the newspaper
and try to catch one of the morning talk shows ,
so try to catch that , if nothing else
that 's true ,
that the news coverage
living in a kind of small town
excellent local coverage
the national news
a real good job and .
have so
about how you ?
have an opportunity to hear just the facts
seems to be more and more of it ,
the void come naturally with both presentations radio and television presentations
they could pass on to us factual more information , but
is going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions
do n't really need their help to do that
we 're certainly in agreement there .
or they have more over that same frame time to do
which answer that is
you do watch that ?
, used to
maybe n't anymore , but once or twice a year
just do n't ever since and watch
we have the same reaction whether we came
they really , was
do n't
do n't know if you 're familiar with him or not so
not really ,
have seen in the last few years
but never got to see his actual nightly news
and he did a pretty good job .
on the nightly news , but now , he goes into his commentary
to get into the problem with him
frequently with his commentaries
they reported the facts
all they can offer is an opinion anymore .
what did you think of the news coverage of the war ?
almost felt like it was too much
of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening , a
spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst ,
a lot was going
your prior experience with
and try to guess where we are going
, do you look at
have taken them all for a year at one
in giving anything a chance .
keep coming back to that one , but
so , is that kind of my favorite .
it is primarily a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports .
that sounds good
if you were short on time , you could
it 's too one
all we have to find in the interest of efficiency ,
most of my reading in the bathroom and .
is going to spend in there
it seems to fit nicely and , just so .
we got an introductory subscription , for
prior to that were all we got
try to bring in a little bit one that were better for us
to broaden your horizons
it ca n't hurt , .
it ca n't
try to catch because it is another example , it
they show you just the words , and the facts
and they do n't offer any commentary ,
a quick chance up during the day
because we do n't listen to the radio at work at all .
go without hearing anything the whole day
's with you ,
is talking fingers , sometimes
you do have that ?
you have different numbers that you can dial , telephone
dial and then in an code access
what topic to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a update soap opera
that can give you current updates news , current updates weather , things like that
and it is offered through the local phone company free of charge .
that so , is that .
it does sound very interesting ,
it gives a wide variety of things you can call and find you
our phone company out here will get to around , offering something like that maybe .
so , that is something you might keep your eyes open for ,
on throughout the country
who 's your favorite team ?
think ?
they did have finally a fairly decent year this year .
at least they are coming around .
they 're going to get better .
.
that kind of killed last year at them .
do n't even know what is your favorite team , actually
did know
just
and they have n't been doing too hot ,
got in fact the cowboys
he was a good player .
, do n't know
, do n't know
for
been over
and get on into the end zone
you could never really see him play , while he was with the team , because with the cowboys
so you really could n't tell if it was just him or the team
always assumed he was too good for the rest of the team and just
but do n't know
he 's been doing real good .
with him so far
did he actually play in the pro bowling .
he was
somebody and then got
and he was supposed to go .
is not sure
have n't been keeping up with football ,
and on about football
since it 's kind of season off , but it 's kind of hard to think back
have no idea
no earthly idea .
he was going to keep him as the coach somehow ,
, but do n't know
how they did end up this year ?
they started out , really bad
they went one and six ,
and then they won five or six in a row .
of games the last
kind of like .
on the upswing
just about much
in fact they were doing better than the cowboys ,
and the cowboys , came on
the cardinals and got
the cardinals ,
do n't know
think the cowboys probably have a better team
of course , he sat all season , along the sidelines
, he never did a whole lot
he did n't get see much action .
too bad
and he did n't look good too
so , and no one is going to have any more much faith in him .
think they are getting a different guy for a backup quarterback in fact
have n't
reading something about them signing on somebody else , or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody a few months ago
but it was n't .
who 's it ,
so , sounds like he is going to be all right for next season .
it was his shoulder that he had the problems with ?
do n't know
think it was
think it was on his shoulder he had surgery
but .
got my day thirty notice yesterday , but
notice for what thirty days ?
is
we ca n't talk much more ,
but just thought
what .
called you
about football for five minutes
ca n't remember
have done this
usually have , too
your ten minute limit
have done once or twice
did n't look at the clock when we started talking ,
about a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in football
making sure we get .
this was a long time ago .
that 's about it ,
was into the cardinals for a little bit
of course .
always have been a fan cowboy
up in a city that has one of the greatest football teams until the last few years
there 's no question about that ,
it was really exciting , when the cowboys were really big growing up .
because my parents , would have tickets season always
they 'd go to all the games , and
and the hype was just unbelievable .
and super bowl and other all this stuff
just because they are having a bad few years to decide
out of it
and they 'll wind up being good again .
really good young players
but , they are raising prices on their tickets .
they are so banking on doing good next season .
again
to going ,
thirty bucks or something ?
it was all one price of all first .
just on the lower levels is the highest prices ,
and then the highest prices next 's
then from the twenty to the yard ten line .
they are some kind of in the corner areas sections , and then
of course the cheapest and then is going to be the end direct zones .
but they have about four or five different prices , now that they are structuring it with ,
obviously is they going up more or less are what it 's going to do all but
now the tickets got so even lower than the lowest one last year .
is not sure ,
is not positive ,
did n't really think about that
to the good section in the little bit cheaper but
'll ever , but not
, have n't been to a game cowboys
because my dad usually can get a holding of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have tickets season , and went
and they 'll give them to somebody else if they 're not going to use them .
with my dad to a game one time that went so
it was kind of different , i guess .
and before that it 's been quite a few years .
, have been wanting to go to a game
never have just got to it around
this year
that is interesting ,
lost almost our electricity here
there .
how you 'd find out about this ?
that 's how we learned about it , and
took a class , and so
said some money and just for five minutes talk and
you ready
is ready
started
'd be a very wealthy person
the steps but ?
you have to see ,
, i look at it
or , has crime as increased
crime and if so increased
go from the country to a city , crime always increases
because in the country , still .
the people in the country and do n't want as much as the people in the city .
the country move to the cities
they get the same thing
they say why we ca have the same things that these other people , have n't
and the thing we can do is that we need money for drugs ,
we have to go get some stuff , steal it
it is easy ,
you said the magic word there .
which one ?
drugs .
and that is certainly
the main reason
because you have deaths .
you have murders
other people 's stuff
a lot of it do with drugs
the thing is that it 's like you might be standing somewhere ,
you are driving out
and you are driving home back
and it 's late at night .
and somebody walk in there with a gun .
they 're going to want the money ,
these people there to get money for drugs
they do n't want the money so they can do something else with it .
they do n't want the money for food ,
that 's for sure .
to cope with the problem
it 's on crime in the country itself .
it 's like , you have other things ,
you have the aids
, some people
may be part of the structure power that are keeping us from spending in that direction the money
but those people never get caught .
that 's right ,
they 'll never get caught .
is going to try to find , if
and they 're not going to take me alive .
such a big army outside
that 's right .
might be the leading drug dealer here , of course
but you wo n't find me dealing in drugs ,
there is no connection between me , and the people who was caught .
that 's right .
that 's right ,
one person do n't know the other person down the line .
many times is part of the structure power
because it is sure
this guy come and over ,
you doing
he started talking to me ,
and he 's got little his brother selling drugs .
came up just here to work ,
you did ,
you make very good money up here .
who , a lot of money
and in the movie good fellows
you did see it ?
only heard about it
in one part , the guy , goes out of jail
within two months , and he had all his house payments gone everything , paid
they have so much money that they did n't know what to do with it at
that was also in the movie .
been nice talking
we have been talking ?
we have been talking .
the call
talking with you
same here
was
credit cards , is an easy topic
it is n't .
it is .
is sure
had some good experience and some bad experience with them
now is like a lot of other people
pay off my credit cards
have done pretty good at it and
go in the store
there 's a big difference .
there 's a big difference there .
but most of mine that i use is
,
,
on a cash basis , except for gas
it 's too easy to run into the gas station .
you work out of town , and everything , that way
that is at least for me .
but
really have some bad experience
have n't yet , and
not bad
of the month the
try to keep but
in that respect
have except for emergencies
really have any bad problems with credit cards
they have wonderful features ,
they are there when .
they have bad drawbacks , too high interest , and then
it 's like paying twice .
that 's true ,
that 's true ,
by the union credit , though
that seems to be a pretty low interest .
compared to some of the other ones
you do n't have an annual fee there , and
that and .
we used ,
and we can go ahead and pay off when it comes in it that way .
to do it , because that force to pay for it instead of saying you
, known
take a long time ,
that 's right .
it sure does .
it 's been going down for a number of years , of course
but this is the last year you can take .
talking to you
talking to you
and maybe we 'll get to talk again .
how do you feel about it ?
do n't have any strong convictions about it ,
that 's for sure .
have n't done any service corps peace ,
ever thought about it even
you do know anybody that 's been ?
think that 's a terrible idea , but
that is like forcing someone to donate to a charity .
try to teach young people some , civil consciousness
it is definitely up to the person ,
it is
, do n't know
but do n't
n't either
have nothing to say about this
n't either
, do n't really have an opinion except for no
think that 's dumb
have been here for almost just four years
that is , how we know .
you and was up just there then .
last weekend
had a good time old
that 's good .
back to the topic at hand
what other types of community service would
the peace
this is a year long term major commitment or six months ,
or do n't know ,
are all for donating my time to worthy causes ,
here and there
'll do big a big brother sister local thing in every once and
or 'll go do a
but is that time .
could n't possibly commit a year or two of my life to go do something
they could n't cover my hourly rate .
could n't afford it
have this thing against bugs , too
'd catch a terrible disease and die probably
i doubt
but , you know how it is .
you do n't know the culture usually
the other cultures and some of that
but do that ,
, do n't know
do n't know
do n't know either
out of college up .
two spent years and , none of this .
and then to come back where they left off
so , it 's
it 's really for the community give back to the type of thing community .
, do n't know
kind of like
a lot of people
and are useful as that kind of a timing probably
in that perspective maybe a little bit ,
when they are in the college the
is sometimes help support it
others , people do
but as far as the peace corps .
think a lot of it 's when people got older
have a different perspective if
but n't
n't
cut off there
is that
a chunk of their life to do work service
is going to go get a good job and make and buy
or try to make a living .
do n't know anybody who is done that either
because we got this topic
certainly did n't mark anything to get this one off
, ca n't imagine
had this topic , and
, and did n't feel like talking
up so
you talk to somebody about it actually
so you have the same one .
you 'll get it over with here .
known
how many times have
probably five or six .
not a whole lot .
have done maybe four or five
she just sent me the information out .
got a holding of it ,
sent back in it , just
she stuck my name on some list ,
the information to fill
what other topics have you that have ?
about the weather
it was hot here , and
so that was pretty interesting .
talked to someone about the , education system and
what exactly what was the focus
but that was fairly interesting .
talked to somebody about credit card usage and
and her family , did n't have much just
and they did n't
did n't know how very how much about them
with my visa everything
it and all off pay .
so that 's a good deal for me .
free money for thirty days
is that
do n't get in debt
that 's always a good plan .
ca n't think
stuff like football and stuff that
and have gotten n't yet
see 's
have
we did .
funny how
so we talked about the cowboys a little bit .
so we talked about cardinals .
so that one was all right .
and then what else
was caught a little off guard , so
and could n't think of anything at all
started making up stuff so
told that this woman
my grandfather gave me , once
when he gave it to me he told me and it was impossible to kill ,
you could freeze it ,
you could dry it out ,
no matter what , you could n't kill it .
killed it pretty quick
do n't have either too much of a green thumb
do have one plant here ,
hanging out for
think it is one of the easiest plants , but
do n't know the name of it ,
have n't
have you ?
that 's a wonderful movie .
the length are n't too long ?
.
we all heard different opinions about it .
you do n't even realize it .
it was too long
they thought that it was going to end , and at certain points
it did n't , and
and it kept going on
thought it was great
have seen some different clips of it ,
and it looks good ,
had the time to go to
ca n't remember what said they were his name
that 'd work ,
let
thought that were really funny
do n't know his name ,
the character in
saw one of him the clip
rather that was .
the driver wagon
is absolutely beautiful , but
them in the dirt probably a little more
the styles ,
but they did n't it quite enough it seemed age .
but it was a very good movie .
will have to see then it
what have you lately seen ?
actually , have been to the movies
think that was the last i saw movie misery
did n't see that
n't really either
went with someone , but
it 's an excellent movie .
, were n't sure
just do n't want to have anything to do with it just
it 's not .
heard somebody talking
she cut off his foot or something .
in the book , apparently , she cut his feet , off
she breaks both of his ankles .
, and could n't watch
but , you could tell when it was coming .
so
that was so that he could n't leave her ,
just it still seems a little .
that at all
you would n't like to see anything happen to anybody ,
it was just how she got so up , but
her emotions
but she was a killer ,
the character prior to
but no one knew that .
we have the time to go to the movies lately
, known
we do n't see movies at the movies a lot .
not without my daughter we see
they come out on video tape ,
them and then .
want to see sleeping with the enemy now
that looks really too good .
that looks good .
want to go yet see
want to see that either
, known
do n't
some friends that went see it
and they said .
some aspects of
liked that movie
so in other ways , it seems
that is about it
it was nice .
maybe we 'll talk again to you .
it was nice talking .
being a former drug user .
in using drugs was not a good employee
an employee of the company
i work for a modern tire tire company
where do you work ?
most of our injuries
is , we 'll have if a man had an accident and a test drug
then he is given a test drug automatically .
it within hours of the accident
when he goes to the first time the doctor .
do n't know if it 's been a deterrent not , because we 've started using for the past year or so it just
we 've let some people go that we found , .
have n't
a separate testing drug
and they showed it negative .
the tests themselves
think that 's probably true , too
that 's sort of scary .
cocaine and then has also
he positive on cocaine
, you 're he just saying that
that 's a bad situation .
, , as far as
think they should
smoking areas
but it 's a little bit separate .
the building
and it 's a factory environment .
have and
but it 's just wide open ,
is not
think that 's bad and
the drugs that i way in the kind of environment factory being think it is essential
just for a couple years now the random
giving a hard time my boss
they never , called
finally , the day we declared war and was my time .
my boss gone for about three times
and told him that he is in a high risk group obviously
the executives ?
did out when we started that they were going to do all them first and of course they specifically on single them
the executives ?
would n't be awful that
was interesting
ca n't
like , is a former drug user
so do n't use any more drugs and
what kind of drugs
all on the job and
had it
it 's really lucky away from that you got .
is really
life is so much more enjoyable .
was losing just from doing a poor job jobs and
that 's it .
much less the drug
just life in
that 's right .
is definitely for it
that 's right .
in some cases
a chemical type
out there and they have serious some chemicals ,
they 've kind of thing that water .
and they have people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals .
and that is really frightening .
just pushers paper like
would think there would be
you 'd think so
but they were n't ?
do n't
is n't
at that time , and they have
that is so scary .
have a friend that was telling me about her brother : get high all the time ,
just ask for a living casually her he did
and she said he is the supervisor of this chemical land .
and just went
we should move ?
me move as far away as possible
that 's awful .
, up in the sixties
it was back and then popular ,
have but really
and they 've really a good for the young people campaign .
it 's not smart ,
that 's right ,
and that 's good .
that is the best way to stop it .
it 's really .
think we did it
it 's good talking to you .
do you have a favorite recipe ?
that 's what said it to discuss some
maybe a recipe ,
it says what you would have for a dinner party .
thought begin said it
maybe we 're all set .
for five minutes
what you would have for a dinner party , says it
you , what 's going
is that
do n't know if it will come out
other things like potato skins and then was going to make .
that sounds good .
you do n't necessarily
that 's always a good thing .
they have too healthy stuff
better even than other kinds of food
and
it nice and fresh
that 's true .
is that
like
of those a
and was
though never made
easy enough to make
think that it would be a lot of work
they are
some chocolate chips and .
that good 's ?
have but never
they really good
do n't mixed well
but they are
that 's good
because they were n't in season ,
is that right ?
of course , .
do you want to discuss the recipe ?
have a recipe if
a lot of people try to stay away from this
is that right ?
have never
it and
about to take a quarter and a half of milk
and you put it on a really low heat .
of the pot the
do n't
the milk
a cup of cornstarch in it
and have this thing
a whip top out of milk if
, do n't know
they are
they are
some of them , they used to be a hundred dollars ,
milk into a dessert
, but did n't get that one
but it 's real handy because it does n't have a cord
right into the milk
it does an excellent job , and
just hand or .
but do n't think it gets it good enough
before the milk gets and then
really them in good and .
a cup of sugar and then about a half
every for about ten seconds
and you just keep beating in it .
you 'd have to go almost probably out
for a good seven to ten minutes
and then you can make chocolate
or you can
really good vanilla favor in it , and some butter
that 's really interesting .
it come in ,
our mothers used to use it .
have some
you could use that
cooking chocolate
that 's really interesting ,
of anybody making their own pudding before
is that
the regular pudding , the chocolate
if , and it would
and it was red ,
a recipe for
out of woman 's day or something
is that right ?
is that
it probably would be a lot more work and turn out probably not as good .
the trick , is to get the cornstarch
right in the lukewarm milk
the cornstarch in a separate bowling
put it in
put it in the cornstarch
the cornstarch into
little balls and stuff
in the cornstarch the milk
'll do , and
'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat up them
my husband really like it thick
it is a little less , when
put in a nice bowling glass , but
some people do n't like that , on the pudding film and
might and put it back on
do you put it in the refrigerator then
it in the refrigerator
hot in your refrigerator you 're going to make it work too hard food
that 's true .
knew that
is that
do n't know
that 's my great hard recipe .
liked music in
none of them and .
do you know who is he ?
, like to listen to a whole lot music piano and
a variety
sort of
not all country but
do n't
do n't know
some of his songs , though
all the time they are not so sad country
they are just kind of sometimes sweet .
they are not the typical country where they are just my wife left me , my dog left me
my truck is broken down .
my truck is broken down
and my house burned just down .
there is a guy ,
he plays piano .
think he is now dead ,
but he plays .
like
play the piano ,
just it or ?
very badly .
've got a piano ,
and my mother vowed that someone in the family , was going to learn
have all so
was the one who did the least poorly , and
so she gave it to me .
and here sitting up mostly
you good to sit down and play it
it 's real relaxing .
it must be fun to be able to play it
can you people will sit and
and you ca n't sing along either
, do n't play
like jazz music
do so
what is that ?
about that
what is that ?
said
forgot about jazz
we 've got about five of those .
.
, too
they are
went in a store music
and you know
heard and a piece
and it was
is n't
peaceful , so that
but , it 's relaxing mostly
singing a song or something like that
you can just sit ,
little those booklets that came along
and you can see just .
the people who have written certain songs ,
then he buys the pieces on have that person on it .
what you 're saying
do n't even know who did which ones ,
but he does .
ca n't identify them either
just like
one , come next
but do n't even know their names
, do n't know their names of the song
but can identify them
like that
i course and like .
in the band you were ?
was in the band ,
was so
was in groups and stuff chamber music , and
so are used to pieces
,
and is like you
like the stuff older too
what is his name ,
the trumpet play .
you did like them ?
mostly the older groups
, like
we got
and , like
like the group .
they a lot sound like
if , it 's
what type
have never
it is
it is
but it 's
but it 's
a whole bunch of
he ca n't hear me .
, do n't remember how many people
but , it 's got men and women
and it 's nice ,
it is pleasant music
it 's not where it hurts your ears to hear it .
it does n't have all the brass and everything .
is my husband
we 're going to go to commerce and see a friend .
you must live in this area .
are
you 're
just because there is a friend , up there
not because there is much else .
having in all the different areas
for colleges ?
and they have been doing a lot of that in the area .
's through
no more for me
no more .
what do you do ?
is just a homemaker right now ,
's , but
and that 's
and , just .
is really interested in the legal environment , but
but do n't want to be a lawyer
'll go back to school
that probably 'd be pretty interesting .
about four showed hundred , up
and it was for a murder trial .
and they have us fill out a long questionnaire .
we stayed till about one thirty
called the ones that they are interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time
that 's how it works .
and they say it 's going to last about two to three weeks .
was an investigator
was and
be that the one and
she and since taken off with another lawyer who had been getting cocaine from his client , and then selling it ,
had and
finally they and
is he and
and this is
,
the investigator
he got off right away .
and wrote
so i figure that
and wo n't be chosen
not necessarily
.
but there 's probably what might make something else .
not for the jury
pretty much a lot of people would know about it , and know some of the different things about it
but some other way they might weed
you do n't believe in death penalty
the death penalty
could believe in in
you 're not going to want to have him have that punishment .
for another murder trial before
it is and so hard because everybody 's wanting to go on and get the sentence done ,
and if there are so much pressure on you
with a decision
you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt
you have to find whether they 're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
books .
mainly these days .
that 's very good .
, too
is that
a lot of novels
and whatever that takes up pretty well your time for reading
it does .
really he and .
just a really want to read it
that 's good .
that 's good .
hard for me
read magazines and stuff like that
do get to sit down and read
and , like to read
read too to my daughter a lot .
do you ?
like reading those to her so
and she really enjoy those .
that is so good .
we do n't have a lot of time , read ,
so for both of us
i guess
this present and
how old 's your daughter .
five .

he is written some children 's books as well
and they are
what is his name again ?
have to look for those
do
his , children 's books
just to read them .
that 's good .
they are good ,
they are great .
that 's good .
that sounds
it is .
it is
'll have to look for those
is that
my daughter had precious collection moments
because it 's like that real easy for her to follow ,
she 'd never understand if any of it .
it 's hard for me .
that 's right .
it 's hard to follow and understand real ,
and help
the hardest thing is
, known
it is sure ,
but it 's good reading
and it is good for us , and everything .
that 's right .
do really enjoy it
read a lot of his
and , like
that 's good fun reading .
ca n't put them down
you ca n't ,

they good
do really enjoy his
there is another guy .
what is his name .
known
who
known
it 's a guy .
he and writes the same thing , though .
real , gruesome , horror stories
that 's good .
his last name , ends in
known
think who you are talking about
is in a book club
in there his books and .
read any of his
it is one of his first books , the stands .
long that thing
known
all of his books have what came from that
kind of
that i love
thought it was great
it was really ,
and loved
that was my favorite .
'll die just
for some reason that .
he just bring stuff alive .
you could just visualize everything .
and that was a pretty scary movie , too .
think they did a pretty good job ,
, but did n't follow exactly they
but they did justice do it .
that 's right .
they do n't follow very well when they make them into movies books , but most of the time
that 's true .
liked it as well
that is , another big fat one .
did , too
that was good .
you did read that one ?
it broke my heart
is a dog lover
too
and then night stand ,
, is that night
dead zone
is that
what ?
dead zone
read that one , too
that was a real good one .
he is written a lot of books .
just just like any other job
known
is that he and then under another name .
that 's right .
he is really interesting .
he is
could do that
known
have gone back and
, too
once you can get into the language ,
it 's so kind of hard to keep at it ,
that 's true ,
they are
literature ?
that was one of my favorite literature was in school subjects .
too
used to love good those old books
did n't mind doing that at all
think of their names
that was another one .
talking about
good old books and classics
that 's right .
neat is
a lot of people just do n't
it 's really hard for me
do you ?
so it 's hard for me to sit down and read ,
can imagine
but just when
too
think we have accomplished five minutes
we have , too
thank very much you
it 's good talking to you .
too
you on a regular programming exercise right now
it and .
about how you ?
's kind of off and on
off on
have been kind of off and on
right now is kind of off
'd say off on more than
what type of exercise do you do ?
aerobics impact low and then .
you do n't enjoy very much that
not really .
you do find that to be boring ?
and , consuming time
it 's not just the exercise that is boring and consuming time ,
it is afterwards ,
you have then
is this something that .
want to play yet or not
it is one of those universal type exercise machines .
n't really down
so it is collecting dust right now .
a lot of things
had an exercise bike
use to have one
and finally got
that 's good .
then go every now
you do n't have any excuse when the weather is bad
just got the bicycle out today ,
and it was nice real outside ,
have to get out to do something
ca n't ride a bike
sitting in all weekend here in the house with
it 's nice too ,
it 's been too nice all weekend .
but
need start something again
have
but it 's
and keep a program up consistently n't really ever so
have you ever had any injuries from jogging ?
have never
do n't to develop any injuries
about a mile or two
that 's not quite , so easy .
you have to have the right , type of too shoes ,
that 's very important , .
walking on toe fronts and
do n't have to buy all
do n't get very much use
my breakdown about every six months
the exercise
is very consistent , not just about maintaining a program
'll bicycle
out on a consistent basis
'll get tired of doing that and go out and maybe about three or four nights a week , but then
but that gets old too in a very short order ,
really need get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
do n't dust
at least exercise while dusting off it
that 'll be good .
have always found to keep something going
we have a choice of taking on exercise education physical courses , when
an one of those involved a six weeks
and that was very helpful
and we consistently increased so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
that be very helpful
you going to do that
to
have n't
but it 's
that sounds like something good then to do .
sounds like something
nice way to start off this spring
get back in shape
how often do you go out on your walking each week ?
switch every other day
one day
the aerobics and .
about how far do you go walking ?
now get my tolerance
had just surgery , then two months ago less
is just a little over about a mile and a half right now , and
that 's good .
good just as if
it 's just it takes to get to the same effect longer .
, is so upset
on the joints then jogging is less
it is
and you can get a on it really good workout .
do you go to an aerobics class
have a cassette
i tapes use .
and they have
and what is
do n't know if he is still on any more or not ,
use to watch one on the air
was thinking of
was
he 's not bad
n't usually either
on the beach
they do i pact low stuff now ,
they do .
they are on every day .
he 's still doing it then .
every morning
'll have
at what time ,
ca n't remember what time
check it back
looks good on that show on
every now and then
not everybody has a perfect body picture .
taped a few session that they have on there actually
n't done so much as
is that
is so kind of bad about that myself
is that
have n't
us pretty soon .
sure i
to you too .
to you later
capital punishment ,
honestly do n't feel like it is in my opinion strict enough
are it or in
at all
you do
you know
and that , the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced ?
let them stay twenty years ,
with that
we do n't have enough prisons ,
be some kind of punishment , for these people
that 's right .
if they turn around , because they get away with it ,
and they get away with it ,
and they get away with it ,
they and then
a slap on the wrist and .
in jail thirty days , they get
going through fourteen appeals and how many hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer and .
that 's right .
that 's right , honestly .
, in a lot of ways
you know
they living at our expense
really a rough time , it seems like
you know
, is not saying innocent person
a hot written checking , for instance
really like it 's a rough time for them
a murderer and well to prison
he is just there to serve his time and get back out on the street .
with that choice is that
that should be life ,
and less they 're out .
if they are even in that long .
or appeal
it was an unjust amount of time , an extraordinary long length or something
time ,
'd like to see more as a deterrent ,
now it 's not a deterrent because it is not really effective
there should be for this crime , this is the penalty .
someone in
it , you get back ,
this is what 's going to happen .
and it sounds horrible .
myself saying this
known
back out again
over , over again
same thing
then they put back in jail ,
they get out , and
innocent more and more people and
at our expense said
a lot of people do n't really
you know
still , but it could .
, known
it in the paper , every day , somebody who is done this or that , something really horrible
they get away , and just
nothing and happens .
the other states , know what their capital punishment
anything , like that
they and then took it off the books ,
it
, it did n't it ,
to death
they reinstated later it , and then
but the penalty did n't go back .
you know
and is n't protecting the rest of the people
left , really out in more or less ,
and especially in things
for one this trial and then he gets , up
find anything out about the facts that he is done over and over and over again this
the first time
a lots of things and
but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too .
and three years and then later
, just do n't make it
there , when you 're afraid to go out ,
and it was n't
who said in a small place like
we could go around ,
was a kid ,
but now are raising children
ever ,
would run between my neighbors , three and four blocks sometimes , when
do n't let my kids out of the front yard
see them .
we run out , pretty soon
have , but
talking to you too
what do you do this weekend ?
pretty much spent most of my time in the yard , or at nurseries buying for the yard stuff .
what you do
but they have gone of neglect a few years .
so , we 're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation .
different beds flower in
get rid of a few problems and things like that weed
do you live ?
on moving to mound flower
and work garden
seems like it
the place we 've been living at we 're just leasing it .
'll
'll
just scratching two or three inches was just a chore .
it was ,
it was
and then you do n't want to get out in the yard , even when
it 's horrible .
it 's a nightmare .
it is actually done ,
know right where that are at
we 've got to a foot of soil maybe eight inches ,
it is solid rock from then on down , and then
it , is ,
put in anything as far as shrubs and things like that
it is .
how do you put in there trees ?
we 're happy just that so far there is trees already there ,
anything like that is
is an awful lot of
it , not even , considering a pool or anything like that and
in i guess
and it makes for a different challenge ,
keep hearing the stories of different parts of town all but
the first thing the old guy at the stands there asked what is part of town we lived in because said he and
each one and work in one part of town
that 's it , and
that 's what basically he was trying to tell us .
we tried planting tomatoes last year
and they turned out pretty poor .
'd known , the variety and everything
we have also roses ,
in fact , we put .
what roses type ?
a few different , type tea hybrid varieties .
of the real short stem a
but do n't know
because the sun 's so intense ,
the roses just fine there
is that
we 've got the lake different editions all around the house
and we 're
the direct sun in
complete long just all day
and , we are struggling to find something for those areas .
not have you , done a lot of surgeon tree work on your trees
they are in pretty good condition .
we 've been pretty lucky on that .
just if , that may be all right because , we have some fruit old trees .
so we may be getting rid of that just
they be doing just fine
but they really need pruning .
a year is not really enough
that 's true .
that 's true .
do n't know
what kind of grass but ?
would hold
but it does n't really .
but .
there is such a difference , through the year .
it 's already
they have been living there for now about three months ,
been bad so that have tried to plant grass
just and they have some big problems time , ,
that 's it .
just their lawn blow away
but it 's
about two or three acres of
it is beautiful ,
you can see the house from miles away ,
but it 's a pretty neat little job
but , they save a lot of energy
but they 're going to have to start gardening just for them .
is it
the whole way .
they said , and we just plan on spending the rest of our lives , just getting this property developed .
it 's amazing ,
, and do n't know , what they have
all the water
actually , they can pump water ,
they have to get permission
but they can pump water up from the shore ,
they have to pay some kind of fee per year .
think right now , though , but
but just think of all of the money that they 're going to have to spend getting just that
really them for tax and .
and you are talking just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes .
it 's ridiculous .
that 's really ,
limit that flow into it , even though
the dry land farm
but do n't know
just to come back
and the air is just so dry .
do n't see how anything can survive out there , for long periods of time
they are smart ,
they are about the smartest around tree .
that 's true .
that 's true .
say they
is so that
they do n't do anything .
one of the house and things like that
of weeks just a
it is kind of disappointing .
do n't know
off just a little bit
do n't happen to have one at home
do have a personal computer on my desk here , but
a type of work station ?
and it works just fine .
no big deal ,
it does the things
it 's not even that .
think that 's about where it is
word
,
use both at work here at home
i bet is a pretty nice setup
it is .
unfortunately need of it all
and is
all my home needs in
have got into more
, have you
and them useful
you struggling along those lines
always be in the next to the last generation of word processing software
can never stay current with that quite so
used to call it
some other machines in days
can believe that
very frustrating
again but have been dealing with large files both data and otherwise
b of specs the
not really .
is not up on that sort of thing that
just a huge filing who try to describe the requirements of
it sounds like you are pretty much into computers .
sure need them
need try to do my job without them
can believe that
it 's been interesting .
play around some
when you start seeing all what they can do for you .
of course , and needs want
.
that must be a fairly recent release .
that came out around the first of the year .
it does a few more things that have been available before .
's , but not sure it 's such a massive improvement
enjoyed our discussion
did , too
and you have a good day .
the
where do you live ?
used to
there for a long time
that 's great .
so , we have many recycling activities
's , and in full support of all of them
, too , .
is our community
a they just opened up .
that is something
got out here by a whole lot better cooperation
very at all too much
the garbage men come by on your garbage regular day
think that 's great
, one for metals and one for glass
and then you can either bundle .
that 's great .
because the city , then get the money from the recycling and , it really pay for itself
we 're all for it .
one is for white paper
one is for colored paper and
tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines
and there 's no way to get rid of them .
it just seems like such a waste .
it does .
it does .
have seen talking about using garbage for energy
and you could also apply the magazines toward that so .
that would be a help .
they would do here that
got so little landfill space
they have to start hunting for places to put the things
known
we did have another experiment novel start this year .
now we can put out all our clippings yard .
you buy these heavy-duty super giant paper bags ,
you by the dozen usually buy them .
that 's great .
that 's a great idea .
in recycling , like that
many people to
and we would n't mind going its extra effort to do it .
think if they make it so it 's not a horrendous inconvenience most people would
--
and do n't mind ,
in and stuff like that the cans
now but do n't
get that two cents when you take it to the store then up , them
known
but so few people have enough to make
more in gas getting down there
also plus the valuable is in line .
had for the bags recycling the one we use
that 's great .
just like they take it off .
they can just
and they say , as long as it is clean
they do n't here
any clean and dry plastic bag
there , and place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers ,
and now we 've got the bag for the plastic bags .
,
my about once a husband .
and he 'll go pick up because he just ca n't stand that them .
nice ,
that 's great .
and you otherwise would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse .
but they have to be in one of their bags paper otherwise .
all have really
that 's not going to be a regular feature .
those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills .
stay and .
along those lines
, too , .
that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile
a lot of that stuff
have one bag full , you
and is only the difficulty with that
but we 're using the china cups at the moment ,
of the year the
are you and then
that 's good .
should they
believe
have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take
and so it will be good , in the long run .
it will sure .
enjoyed it
good to talk
what 's your view ,
do you consider a threat the soviet union ?
know what kind of a threat it is
place completely turned around much that
if it is a threat one
you never know ,
it was seen as
is happening
are we
are sort of say , if we 're not going to do that anymore
'd like to think that are n't true and
the whole thing is
'd have been asleep for five years
are , of course , our economy
do n't
heard , but it one time ,
and finally who knows
just one person can
even if it is the best thing in the long run , it just steps .
still just a little bit of the whole thing
have n't seen
and one of
of course , it did n't
and that may have been a kind of far way of thinking about it out
do n't know
it is interesting , anymore
have not been world powers , course , but
to get back ,
or we 're going to force you .
or we can do something about it .
okay and said
and that is enough .
and the tanks took care of that pretty much
he do some change and
believe in this first pass , around
and took off suddenly toward some pretty hard just socialism ,
there will be a union
that , the whole soviet system
seeing now with a lot of those , areas
those people did n't vote to become part of the soviet union ,
they have no choice .
that was always kind of interesting ,
the stance of these people be free
we all joined under a common direction , and a bond common to begin with
is not
probably more into a pact than a volunteer or willingness to join
the whole thing was put together by force .
there is no real question about that .
it 's not they come in , and
then , just given back and never .
that is , a little different situation .
countries seeing that buffer , is n't going to help you that
and they 're going to land in other places ,
that 's going to be the safest place to be .
that 's very probably true .
that 's very interesting ,
never thought of that
, really do n't know ,
i hope what 's happening is exactly the way it appears
when it happens finally you say
nobody knows what to do .
what really is happening here .
it 's real ?
that was it ,
and , these were all the soviet economists
they have some real fancy names for them .
as a vote
they backed down on that .
died down on that
but it is merely an economic now .
what you do
something is called an economic force or what is called a military pact ,
you can change the name of something
wonder if it still exist , but .
not welcome home particularly back because they are having shortages housing now
they are going home
that 's what they 're saying
we going to do with all the soldiers over there
was the question
read just
with little two kids can understand that
that is simple .
to escape
and do
finished just one last night
a great book .
, it 's very a typical though for my reading
strange book
by somebody who was there
a guy was there as a foot soldier
can imagine
what is the latest one you 've read ?
tell , what
, is trying to back now think
an awful lot of periodicals and almost what you calls reference books
have similar problems
as a matter of fact ,
, finished one
think two years ago
and did n't do that much for me
but the period of time were fascinating .
, was of freedom battle it cry
think it was cry battle of freedom
of freedom cry .
it 's not a story of the civil war , and
to the events that brought about the civil war that
there was a lot more to than that it
there was a lot more to than that it .
it was a political move .
really surprised me
and are not
have got the same problem
that way you put
all this civil war pride and
is n't much there , there were ?
they 've been there not even well .
they were n't
was and after the only way that they have any part in it
and keep telling that my husband ,
and he keeps saying , .
,
and they have an interesting time there .
'll bet they did
ca n't think of the guy 's name
, why they held them off actually
that , could be it .
you did n't
and they did n't get across the river there
and that were actually after the war were over
and they won the whole thing
is that
is that
if corn did n't grow there , and it did n't matter .
so what does that make me ,
's she then
is fiction science of those kind
kind of it
read a lot more than
get out two or three books
read all four of them
understand and
he 's been on the road a lot in the last six weeks .
was space ,
did n't get on that very far
and even then was so disgusted with it
whatever one it was that it was a blockbuster seller such .
got a hundred about pages through it
ca n't do this
kind of
see 's
do n't think
that 's a big , thick book ?
for the
because that is
awhile back and they have
take command ,
that was pretty good .
do n't know
'd call it fiction or fantasy science
it is sometimes awful hard ,
some of those got
they can
put them
loved
and had a hole in my roof
was waiting for the whole house to collapse , and
read and rather ironic
you 're reading dune .
any piece of
, that was n't it
the movie and was awful .
it was ?
it was just terrible .
did n't see
, do n't know
figure out at all , what ,
real in that
'll tell you ,
you like scary things do ?
books pretty scary
that 's true .
somebody , saw the other day the movie here , told me
they did n't
or not want to go see
is the book
just
wo n't tell you then
that is the one .
that is the one .
because the character who is so horrible is another human being .
to kind of like him
is this guy smart
the worst kind ,
how do you feel about the laws immigration ?
ethnic particularly for certain groups from certain countries .
in the last several years
but that 's just my opinion , of course .
known very little about the current immigration laws
do not quite go along with that ,
that does n't make .
again , kind of having within this century , come from an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides .
both my mother 's parents and my father 's parents were immigrants
is so now and then about that
they fit into the family
they were born all here
so do n't have any real strong ties with the immigration laws
do n't have any personal feelings about them
have n't and
believe we should permit constant immigration into this country primarily for economic reasons
my grandparents came over during the time when there were quotas .
with that
they find a new market for their brand of crime
there is another aspect of this , too .
was not aware of that
age , for example , is one
think we should be a little more circumspect about it , but
my opinion
long enough
think so .
talking to you
long enough
thank you .
's see
is supposed to start
everybody done it so far
we paying a lot in taxes
we have a lot of freedoms
one of the only countries in the world that have all the things that we 've probably
the government give money to the stuff hospital
up for many years , now
have to agree
and you 're right .
we do have a good government .
things , the taxes to support
sometimes it to be
or get all of the waste out of the spending ,
it seems , but
there is
the city , and can add theirs
the county , and adds theirs
which seems to me nuts .
we paid when and six cents on the dollar ,
and that was one of the highest in the nation .
think it 's seven here
seven
seven seven five
whole
it drives me crazy .
screaming about we do n't want a state income tax ,
the sales tax to go up and up and up and up
and they do n't do anything about it .
are
what
do n't have the state tax
that 's true .
but
is the sales tax
that 's true .
where do you come originally
.
an urban area
.
do n't know
and has some experience with taxes there
just here
, but do n't know
,
that 's right .
was for a long time holding
you find someone at home
and so that 's what they were trying to do with the situation tax .
do n't think they really cared about the answer ,
they wanted to try and catch him in something just .
in paying taxes , but
and
like everybody else try
than more to
they up for useless reasons
believe , but they are necessary
really
deal with taxes in much when
not really .
spends a lot of time with our income tax , though
for just a few years
schedule a
all the deductions and all that
when they passed the simplified new tax act , it seemed
it really did .
saw , that , too .
, except that they took away the deductions , the interest , other things
we 're looking at buying a house ,
and that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house .
and it will help tremendously .
five years ago we bought ours
and it is the one thing ,
it seems like you make every month those payments
you paid all interest and no principles
so that definitely will help in taxes and what you will get back .
can about it ,
paid twice a month , every two weeks
is a month
that 's right .
if so , you 'll come out extra paying one month every year .
that 's right .
if , and it will take off of your note seven or plus years .
that 's right .
and they did that .
and that is exactly right .
, though , is the note
because of exactly what you just , said
you 're making more one month 's payment every year .
that 's going on the principle , and
it does n't pay any interest ,
or , it does n't usually .
so , that 's a good way to do it .
it was a good payoff for being able to pay off it sooner .
we 're not going to go longer than twenty .
but , we 're taking our time .
that 's good , though .
we started just two or three weeks ago .
and we 're not going to kill just ourselves
two houses or three a week at the
that 's good , though .
it is kind of a buyer 's market down there ?
that 's good .
credit union had nine percent interest .
that 's pretty excellent .
, do n't know
we could n't think of a better time to buy now than .
that 's good .
ca n't think of to a whole lot say
ca n't either
the call , though
too
talking to you
same here
there for two or three years before
i guess before
just a
to go ahead .
anyway , but
so she was at school out here ?
she went to school there .
what was her name ?
good luck in your house hunting
thanks a lot
.
.
is in human resources
that is interesting .
work in the waiver .
really do you ,
and for about eight years
and then have been in human resources for the last two years
and , i work with those same people all those nine years
kind of part of the staff
are turning in a capital request right now ,
.
where you 're from
what
's sort of an acting engineering process
not officially ,
but that 's pretty much
is that
good deal .
, like
he is hard ,
but we needed that .
that 's good .
it was the same kind of thing ,
he had a lot of good results .
here that 's what he said .
he 's got into a linear flow that we never have been in before us .
a big real
making more stable too
that 's good .
it anyway was
you too
can tell
they will ,
my daughter and wants to put her to bed me .
too
have a good day .
too
with any of
living around the area in there
and there was to take nowhere else
and they said they moved it just behind .
known , because we were doing the same thing
and we started taking them up there .
and then , it all disappeared .
did n't know
and , we 're going .
find out that it is behind there
could n't even think of what you call them
aluminum cans ?
that are too
really , and that is really about it .
what else any place really take anything other than that
the room to store all that much
known
running down there
known
known
we 're kind of the same way .
is really going to do this , and
different things in different places ,
just so go
we have a pretty good size in our kitchen pantry
have just got three trash cans sitting in there
dump things in
, too
and they are
you ca n't get the down to any size .
so ,
we kind of about a year and a half ago started
we were using food baby
and there were so many baby food jars .
some of our neighbors was doing it
to take some places
and they take some things at the mound flower also
that will be good .
give it to the city of mound flower
something out of it
that 's true .
and they wo n't raise our taxes .
n't
just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here
everything is made from that .
they would do that , because at least somebody was getting the money out of it that was going to use it for good ,
just like sounds like you have a little one .
it was good to talk to you .
it was
they pick up .
they really do .
it would make it easier a lot on all of us .
to you later
, first
's rocking my little girl to sleep ,
so you are a homemaker ?
i guess , that 's .
so guess .
.
with two kids home
we have a new one in the house
she also stay home and too .
have a wide variety
not so much
you sound like my husband .
go there .
the good ones
, but do n't know
have seen
the show
just do n't watch it
think there is enough to pick from out there , but
and do n't think they should watch
or used to be really hooked on all my children ,
.
'd eat and then
and my kids started recognizing what was going on
gave up so it
have
now do n't
every once in
, and do n't recognize anybody
that 's a good sign
might this
was five and six and my mother watching the edge of night
you 're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm , and the edge of night .
secret storm
and they were black and white back to back
and was
my mother watched all that stuff , too .
thought and as the world turns , still may .
still be on .
it was not too long ago .
a lot of
you 're right .
think some of the tones of the daily prime time 's questionable ,
have to agree with you
keep them on
,
it 's too real interesting and the difference in my kids ,
my younger one does n't .
tapes and stuff on
a lot of
that sounds like you got your hands , full there
speaking with you
it was fun .
have your catalog ?
do n't think so
just got my in the mail
me make more phone calls and
had a few people
have but never
get
give them your pen number
is that
have a good day .
can tell you pretty much
and is the one other night court .
think they are real different and
do n't think they have anything in common ,
but mostly it is kind of fiction science ,
and it is adventure and things like that
court night 's pure weird just fun , and then
it is nothing serious about it at all .
of them the two be my favorite shows two
but that 's the way it is ,
my husband 's favorite shows two
enjoy watching both of them , and
but did n't like night court to
have seen so much
and is
he is .
and , is that
that 's right ,
at times
i guess
him changed , though ,
this season he 's still
but he is
just because his mind was on the ozone layer , and global warming and other all this kind of stuff that he turned down a date with some beautiful woman even
part of
think it probably add a little bit of depth to his character
of course which he needed .
think so
involved in so many other people 's lives
he is doing amazing things
but he is doing within the bounds of what a normal person them
is that
like
what do you consider your favorite shows ?
my favorite show is
.
they took out
ca n't remember who are her name ,
did n't enjoy her
think that 's what they try to do , and
they say , and there was a conflict between her and him that they could never really get her into any character that they could use .
the second lady ?
the second the one
they did n't .
they were never partners .
she would go her way ,
and he would do his ,
did n't like
but it seemed like it was almost two different organizations ,
hunter , was the boss
and other this girl , was not
, when did this happen
so
with that of
like the new lady
'd , but that they did n't have the romance there
'd have just as soon the story police without the romance all
are afraid that that 's what they really wanted to do ,
think most shows , were doing that
and then they went away from it
they are starting to go back to it , and now
maybe and that 's
, do n't know
the mystery
and that 's
but they started it ,
they 'd pull it back , and then
and they 'd start it and pull it back .
or whether they 're going to be partners just
i kind of
always of
these two people
, and
is that
and just
maybe it 's not a good example .
was the last season , to where the two of them got
that was the killer , and
was going to say
to go ahead .
is what killed it
same thing
so the show and died .
do so much more of the subtle hints and the little subtle plays on things before
are everything
the characters ' personalities and of course , another one of their mistakes 's .
why they would do that ?
no sense
unfortunately , that is probably true .
the big shows soap opera , when in ,
you do watch who is the boss ?
have seen before ,
but do n't regularly watch it
hardly ever
the same thing to
and then they pulled them apart
then if the show let them together get all about
kind of
you do n't care or something like that any more , but then when
probably ,
it affected me when
too much lately is not into rock stars ,
do n't particularly like either one of them
there was no way that they could stay together
or at least , that 's the way i look at it .
, so do n't know
would have been hard
would think so
you 've got relationship to develop in the first place ,
they would n't be easy .
that 's kind of interesting .
about what need do we , is n't it
we covered our time
it 's been good talking .
really .
the first man
been
this is so a change .
the second female
you have a little bit of variety
kind of
thanks much .
personally do n't have any children
so children would n't be very convenient for me right now .
they would
how do you spend the time with your children ?
of mine both
and they 're into sports
as a matter of fact , that 's what we are doing tonight .
are
baseball started
does the year old eight play baseball ?
start at five here .
and , in his league do they have a pitcher
or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what ?
nine which my little boy will be nine in may
is he so
but
we 're into baseball ,
and it seems
there is always something .
and how about on the weekends
do you do sports
or do you go out ?
.
go somewhere if we 're not doing sports .
the summer time
and where do you go ?
different places every year .
you be out of the country
know first before your country
and that must be the thing .
they have n't really either .
they went to the memorial ,
it 's when on business
it 's not
it is a beautiful city .
i bet it is , too .
and that was the most boring place on earth .
different places
we kind of staying usually close , but when .
now , but do n't know
but let 's see ,
that was fun .
that was ,
lives in turkey ,
my parents and down there .
is so alone
that was a lot of fun .
but , what happens is that we used to fight a lot ,
there are so never much of a thing family .
also , we 're
was less than a year old
have always so just a mother
always thought , so when
my dad , all he wanted to do was get money for us ,
so he could buy us material things .
material things
threw never a football or something
he wants me , and now
he wants to be best friends now
best friends , now .
and it 's very hard for me
you to be up twenty years old
it is always the same men and
he that he is getting , and then suddenly see old
he wants to be best friends and
can express myself only
because my family , taught me that .
it 's i love
do n't feel like it
my uncle and his family
when his little girl was five years old , and everything they would go to the beach ,
she could go to sleep at two in the morning and
was brought the same way up , and
it does n't matter what age you have ,
so long as you can get up just you can stay up ,
you have to
honestly
have to death
and they have children ,
their children , but does
we have
and get really after that
because you 're saying , i too work full time .
you might have ,
but it is not your kids ' problems ,
, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying
problem ,
good and bad at the same time
first of all you are coming
of the problem
that 's very hard to do , and
once because you 're
very with you so much
before we started because we were still in college , having children
would not have been a good idea
my father was before he had me , raising three kids
are you
and it 's pretty hard ,
have only two kids
, but would n't have you then
but then you would have a lot of money .
that 's right ,
but you ca n't take , though this money with us
keep looking at it
four children 's expensive especially for me , but .
, are paying thousand three
what is it six , two hundred thousand dollars for one semester .
people say it 's expensive to think it 's college , and
, but if everybody would be a little bit responsible
what does it cost .
it costs five hundred dollars a semester .
to a state college
living at home and
it costs and two hundred dollars for books ,
, but a semester hundred dollars ,
if you can ,
save up seven hundred dollars probably four one hundred thousand dollars
you learning to be
excuse me ?
out of college
is
my husband 's into computers .
they send me back home
my dad want me to go back .
and you do n't want to
never because if then , you can get out .
you do n't have any money to get out , .
was and
and get
have kids there , and now
'll never leave the place and then
then you 'll never leave .
, known
and that 's what happened to my brother .
he came up here ,
bad off from being able to stay here that his life just went down the drain up , not just so
maybe something will open up for you .
have been calling a lot of companies
there ,
some of them interested
can work for
talking to you
same here
, do n't have any first hand experiences about
have concerns , but
and have a few ideas of how to combat it
you need money
so that is one thing
that 's crime that you ca n't fight it if you need that money .
and it 's been a very large city and growing increasingly always .
it has kind of the split population .
a lot of
that been the worse thing that we 've seen
the neighborhoods into
it or do stay in the bad neighborhoods ?
but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies , rape and car crime .
there 's a very high percentage of car theft .
a lot of the cars
and they take them apart ,
, is really lock up your car
very much so ,
very much so ,
downtown if you were come , in fact , they have for there
they are in the car , until
the river walk area , which is the tourist area
at evening again , but they have the tourist high area , the area , which is nice , walk river
but you do n't want to get off the beat track .
is very tight
you do n't so and
there for just
and it was n't over
of the island the other
it was at night ,
this boy , and really wanted to go on the beach
and they look at you crazy
you do n't go on the beach .
it 's a big tourist town ,
for a walking on the beach at night
they said , and no ,
very safe in
it 's just so sad ,
it 's really just so sad ,
it 's really just so sad because you ca n't enjoy any more anything .
education is a lot of it .
and they have just hopeless lives
down hopeless tunnels .
think education helped a little bit there
and the kids young
kids with elderly people
their snow in the winter time
they have a big brother , sister big program .
they have bottling drives ,
they have outings cleanup .
and , you might keep them
in school , one on one like a big brother trying to tell him , but again ,
it 'll get better ,
your mom so does n't have a job
she does n't work , and
you do n't know ,
you can be better than that .
you do n't have to live .
that 's good ,
that sounds like they 've got a lot going on there .
but it 's so cheap
they do n't have a problem here .
they can deal with that scale .
they might have troubled youths hundred five .
the kids now , it 's twelve years old
and they 're selling drugs
everybody is responsible for the society ,
they do n't care about anybody
they are just the bad rich big guy
and we do n't have ,
so
and we should take it .
do n't
start with a lot of these kids
many of them , they all
a lot of the parents that it is totally irresponsible
these kids old fourteen years
the parents might be thirty years
's thirty years old , and
, is kind of irresponsible and
or do something
their home drugs
the kids sitting there in the same room
it 's just that they have absolutely no morals
and it 's really sad .
and do n't
do n't know what the answer is to that problem
like your idea of education
get from someone else from the schools
those kids
and they come home ,
do then
feel
do n't know how to make it better for them
, ca n't remove they
they ca n't leave and say it 's not acceptable , just
, is leaving the big city , mom
, and are going off
when they are ten , they have to live in it ,
it 's really sad ,
if they did have a big brother , sister big program
those people help the kids
them like you 're judging us ,
think so
and are not good enough to raise my child , that 's true basically
in a big city not just because
, do n't see
just a matter of night
known
all kinds of
but there 's a lot of them ,
but any big city has a bad section .
it 's very prevalent ,
a lot of the crime is very prevalent .
they are very bold it seems .
very much
everybody pretty well , most seems
there 's a lot of crime there , and
so , it 's pretty quiet ,
the streets at night
people in the parking and run ,
can walk the streets
, would n't
think if there would be trouble in our house ,
you would n't so
do n't think you would , but
someone might grab around with you you , mess ,
that 's what you 're going to have to expect that to happen .
'll have to keep in mind that
and never really got into that too much
and did n't know anybody who had a boat ,
do n't so too much in saltwater fish
one or two small sharks
.
with them do what
put them back
a big kick out of
shark i love steak
but the i ones caught was never large enough to really do anything .
a limit on
a fish sport
you can catch actually those
and there 's no limit .
there is a limit ?
have no idea
shark in the gulf
once been
have n't
could do that
try once
you did .
did n't like it ?
of it the
it looks
it 's a rhythm or something .
bass tree
almost got an owl once
you did .
that would have been something .
or you do
are
people who catch and then .
you just like to sit down and watch it .
that 's right ,
have never
that 's nice .
about you
have n't been really in a long time
that was real fun .
at lake worth
memorial last day
caught my first bass that were actually big enough to keep and
was
and that is really about it .
mostly just the lakes around here ,
i fishing and take home and cooking
too much joy out
a little bit of relaxation from it
mainly want to say , but
did this ,
was out there for a reason
was with my daughter , a friend of hers and a friend of mine and his daughter
was the only one that did not catch , a single fishing
my daughter caught fishing ,
his daughter caught fishing ,
he caught fish .
everybody but you .
was out on a boat party a few years ago ,
it had to be you .
catch one to save your life .
that 's right ,
the boat to
the captain boat party , and could not understand
funny ,
and it was really , really , really bad .
is not a catcher
though it but .
out as much as
a lot of
that would be fun .
actually pick them off
hand picked .
that right
fish in a canal
they have all these canals , up through this retirement little one area
in the canals
, and was catfish
and we was pretty bored with that .
some crab in here
we 'll try to catch some crab .
, has a rock to weight it down
and with it just runs
there is no hook and of course ,
so it ca n't be a fish .
is sure it 's not a fish ,
, do n't they and crab
they just do n't run with your food .
so ,
it has real teeth , like human teeth
it looked and
had no idea that it was
my father long distance describe just the thing
it had the in its mouth , not the chicken rock and
is itself , but the rock
it 's a dog fishing
'll never get over that
get anywhere in the water , water salt around
do n't
have never
and it has a strong huge mouth ,
that is where it gets its name , obviously .
one ever caught is probably eight or ten inches
just huge , ugly things just terrible , but
you can eat them ?
to even if
you do not want to do anything with them
that is like this fishing dog ,
to death
it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died .
threw out my line and
a shark sand , which was a foot and a half or two feet , probably long
and scared me to death .
, and then felt something relatively heavy
and are going to get one really
with putting yet someone in there
but my mother 's
have always so
how do you feel about them
can kind of see ,
can really
to be the last resort if
had a touch of experience
if it 's a to have thing ,
she put in , and
he was n't very long before he died , but there
that maybe they wanted to give him some medication to sort of just
and that is always
i kind of think that 's
that is like everything else , though .
run
but never have been there actually
and knows she is about the kind of what would n't allow a lot of the horror things to take person
but is
, known
also involved in one
really a wonderful job and .
but there still are those little things that happens
more if it comes to that if you ca n't just
you do n't sometimes
that 's it .
tied with their own lives and things and usually working
other things
one would be happy at
think that are too important
, too , .
where my mother , is one to
in order to get in you have , but
in other words , you ca n't
but then if they have a separate for those who need all the time care section
and they have a long waiting list , too .
be able to walk in the door
so you ca n't wait until you are too bad off
off ,
then , you do n't want to go do
everything you worked so hard for all your life and
that 's a hard one , so
but it 's
there are some really nice ones .
there also are some private ones
but of course , would be able to afford to put my parents in something like that never
that 's the problem
that 's way out of my reach .
someone has a small amount of money
but can go in and get the same care
the
so do n't like that aspect
they could put it in one of their children 's names or something .
still , a lot of them but do n't feel comfortable doing that .
it is their money .
that 's right .
feel , anyway
my mother about
you have control of your own business
what she is so naturally , retired
is still
is that
really
just as long as they can ,
have and then on the other hand
that 's true .
with a lot of people around
they are
lots of stuff going
and they 'll take them places
, do n't know
it 's not all bad
then if you ca n't get around and do things you 've really some problems
around ,
, but really do n't know what the other solution would be
n't really
but
'll hopefully really when the time comes
really
, have been raised in one
things to look for
and do n't think they 'd want to go where they used to work , either
n't really
that might be kind of tough .
it would , really
is still in it ,
and really do n't think my mother 'd want to be there , either
it 's been nice talking .
too you
we 'd get back better
what do you think about it ?
we doing in recycling
think we need do more
to do more
they come and pick up .
have a hard time of separating my trash
have n't just and
and we try to do a lot
but there still are a lot more we can do .
we do n't always read
sometimes it just sit around , for
do n't get the paper every day ,
but that is done
'd like to be able to do more
it 's not always
can imagine what it 's like up there
is sure where the can thing , is not exactly
me a gallon little bucket five
and it 's just outside the door garage
into the bucket just
it is actually metal and
it is
did n't want to buy a plastic one
because those things would
and they 're metal ,
but it was only seven dollars ,
not too bad
we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here ,
but we have some occasionally around ,
for other kind of cans , it 'd take only , but they probably
do n't think it would crush steel cans ,
it 's pretty tough .
, do n't know
the other ones for
need more look into it , but
, even with the newspaper they say they 'll take only sometimes
they wo n't take
so do my husband ,
a lot of
just now come on board
we 've been throwing out there paper away for years ,
ever since big this thing earth day came out
is sure they 're doing here that some probably
is
think it is necessary ,
, like
these boxes , cereal
now they are starting to make ,
made out of recycled paper
think they are just fine and
work of the guys at work there
it is his birthday ,
we 're pretty good friends ,
and that 's what it 's a recycled paper bag
got happy printing on it , and a little cute phrase birthday
it 's just a bag paper and
and it 's really
think we 're doing better and better all the time , but
we ca n't just
there are not going to be any room , shortly .
it out on barges
are we
think there 's quite a bit more we could do
put away ,
now .
but , you 're right sometimes it does seem like it 's more than what it would be worth trouble
it was
seems like you are so busy anyway ,
and then that is just one thing to have to worry about more .
it is sure .
so that you could do that , it 'd make it easier a lot more programs
get into it , too , or later
get the kids in it too .
and we just do n't have any place to store those kind of cans .
pick a bunch of cans from people they 'll save them for us ,
there is no problem there .
but what do you do with them in the meantime ?
that 's right .
do n't want a garage full of cans
that 's right ,
who do
people do n't have room for that kind of stuff .
is not
things just like that , they get .
.
the bugs more
that 's for sure .
that 's right ,
are pretty lazy right now
pick it up .
.
need get better at it
if , a little bit goes a long way .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then we 'll get there .
that 's true .
that 's right .
for talking to me
for called
no problem ,
take care .
see 's
in the trial by jury .
you persuade everybody to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure you before
really until proved guilty theory .
think that 's a good way to do it
that 's about all .
then for any case involving serious injury that maybe to another person needs some kind
certainly involving that , trial by jury for anything but should .
not having to take a full court before
there a type of word called a jury duty
lesser degrees of magnitude
and he had his pockets full of stuff when he was caught
that kind of stuff you can turn to the judge and say , your pleasure your honor , just
and there is not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing .
the way our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time , but
of right to a speedy trial the true
that 's a good idea .
do they need a lengthy big twelve jury person
or do they need a person six
and the seriousness of it ,
how
like you was saying ,
somebody go off for three months and try to figure out what happened really like that a jury
that could work .
we call supporting a whole segment of society
good idea .
not you have a real case .
this harassment
that 's a good idea .
in the bible it says that do n't
that is so right off that same kind of principle .
bet
that 's a good idea .
that 's true ,
that 's true , too .
are the whole judicial system and the government
it does n't work ,
but it 's
so that could work ,
who is that
is
that may be right .
it is there in some place .
think we know that we 're talking both
, known
but that 's
too
too
but it 's been a pleasure talking .
same here
what part of the country
was just
that 's quite all right .
is so
is that
are
'll
and it was nice talking to you .
my pleasure .
have a good day .
too you
some of your favorite foods
we got what some people call the best in the world beef .
in our house , it 's
there is this whole special place in the back
you can make a barbecue so .
and it is
have to find a place around here that have that
in mind ,
or for a family
excuse me ?
when you have company
is down at home
we having this
'll cook it and
you all these different meats take different times and then put .
you do n't go buy it from a wholesaler .
butcher little shops
so known
and so they got the place meat .
and so you just go there
and , you ca n't find there ,
you got to go to another place to find .
you have poultry place .
serve what with it ?
the turnover ,
,
and then that is start with out .
and then is what you have also
and that 's about it .
he moved ,
that is so before your time .
your parents might remember if they were here then .
we were only there for two years .
he was
are
this was of the century the turning around .
'll tell you ,
we and both .
usually mix
really easy recipe and
you can many of the things in a microwave steam .
do n't know if you have one
it is ?
it is
buy the fishing
you can do in the microwave the breaded fishing , so
and
what kind of fishing ?
any white fishing
's good ,
that
's real good
take to a cup of water boil
n't
wait ,
wait ,
wait ,
either way they 'll spell it .
pork how much do you
could probably go half a pound
you can do the same thing if you have ground beef also .
fry stir just the ground beef
drain off the oil
just in
and you 've got another dish .
it does
would serve for quite a few meals you
it is not at all expensive .
listen ,
it was good talking .
same here
your recipe
thank you .
think you would offer as far as information about selecting a school ?
a pretty good idea of
finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of job assistance and all
some fields which a person should go to that school , all four years
some fields where it is not really necessary
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff
it 's your core education , your education general requirements .
they get a liberal arts degree
you 'd like to go to
is that
did n't care about the program or anything else
wanted to go
what was in your degree ?
political science
political science ,
is going to school right now ,
, have a friend and
are
known
think
have a friend ,
if , you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public institution
and it 's a lot cheaper .
to a private for the first two years institution my
after that she , and found out
she said my parents , they wasted really a lot of money .
this is about twenty years ago .
feels as far as selecting a school
it does .
did n't after
and and
decided , to hell with it ,
did n't want it
went to law school and
and did n't want that either after
have n't
did , but really enjoy the law
, wanted to be
just wanted a degree law
would be far better off in the field paralegal being
and do n't have to
is so that
and are pretty happy with it so far
is a speech major therapy
that 's very probably useful .
is actually
it 's all working together .
is really education , which requires really about four or five different fields
wanted to be a teacher ,
a substitute teacher for
could n't
but is being a public school teacher
a disgruntled graduate student
is just a disgruntled person all around
think law would be a fine profession , fine field to go into
was in a political science class ,
the remark about lawyers , about their integrity
probably you got everybody on you , because they were all probably going to law school
there was a woman ,
lawyers and all this
best my friends
known
best my friends
now blacks
, known
law was a lot of fun until
and it does n't become fun anymore .
have a friend
's she
into law
what 's going to happen when she gets there .
will all of her dreams
it is very much like that , except worse if you 've ever seen .
and probably more
it is .
that happening
very much .
it 's a lot of that .
it was
on being a lawyer
if you have any doubts whatsoever , you get better not .
ten years and .
but would n't trade the experience for anything in the world
in law a
went to a language school ,
and it was an institution united states .
was at the time military
what branch was in you ?
what branch was in you ?
was in the air force ?
was too
think for military experience were fine ,
the service after
it ,
had a terrific job
what was your job ?
command
was n't
did n't go crew flight
did n't completely through that field make it
was in school intelligence and short about three weeks ,
, did n't make
i sort
they should actually do some reading
that 's right ,
even get some experience at it or watch at least some people
and they should study it .
for kids working after school said
a person people
that 's true ,
in high school was
tell , and what
can tell you , and
as a technician lab
and worked front desk
and somebody could walk in the door ,
was going to do and
was too the same way
is not a person people
it 's not just for me .
is going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot
that 's good .
drug for certain types of positions
endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives
with that
driving like truck drivers and things
think definitely
's and
prior to hiring drug companies
within my company
do n't know of
feel like it 's really and
it is
they go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over
by doing that every time not save money
at other your place work
random about
if that 's an invasion of certain people 's rights
if it 's not fairly done .
and that is probably my question is how do you know it 's fairly done .
do n't
then it is
that 's not necessarily fair and .
it is
but then it is kind of like a lottery .
another person does n't win anything
and it is
.
how they do pick their people ?
an initial testing drug at
but it is to identify the ones who have the problem
.
do you think that should be implemented in the place work
has a manager or supervisor
not do n't have a problem with that personally
but think that might be a violation of someone ' rights
personal problems for
their manager and assume that they have a problem drug
if someone assumed of me that would
a drug user would behave when normal
your supervisor accused you of using drugs
have been in the same job for three years ,
three years in
have already and
what type of job do you 've ?
is an environmental engineering
three times
in their lifetime
have so for some reason
that 's pretty high statistics .
or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone
at all .
it 's a legal job
so it 's really strange .
that 's odd .
now have for the prior job
from my old company
what the man hired did n't
or do they have the ability to say tested her
she negative up
do n't use drugs
once they tested just me .
used to work , but
was just one of the office folk
the service people but just across the board .
and
it 's a rotation .
.
what you 're in job
are fixing power lines
the power lines and .
they make , but those guys are the drug testing schedule .
.
they say we 're testing you tomorrow
while test you every three months
so they know .
it 's made very clear .
have we spent our at least five minutes ?
think so .
nice to you
to you .
it is doing a good job or a bad job
a rural place more like
public schools being
but you 're excluding high-level education .
.
do n't think there are so much of a problem there
it is
is sure
them go to a public school system there
people but of course
and they ca n't do that .
, do n't know
the schools and bottom percent across the country ten rate down here
having been through school grade up there
the teachers do n't know what 's going
that 's really too bad , because it is giving some people unfair advantage .
what we learned .
high up there
just what 'd already done
a parochial school before
even the public schools and .
more direct education
a career path
or you get
learning over and over the same things
they talk about it
or if you 're going to go the science route you can go to a school who specializes in science or art target
is an engineering student
and are not going to use them if
gone so much further if
that 's true .
was fortunate
is a technician
in high school
they do n't know what to do ,
there are too many kids and not enough teachers
and too many of the kids do n't care .
in the cities , it 's really to learn
the parents send them because they are supposed to , and there
plus it gets them out of their hair .
you can send a kid to school ,
think if you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage , but
some kids , want to go learn
but most of them just want to go play .
or maybe they are
and they 're at the world ,
can see where that would n't be very good for a kid ,
he is coming up , will you help me with my homework
, they get away from me ,
had a terrible days
a lot do with economics in
that 's true .
at the moment , not
, do n't know about that
but a lot of the industry up in the northern states is moving south
if that 's going to have now
we 're behind down here .
live here
maybe they 'll bring their good schools with them ,
if the industry comes hopefully they 'll promote good schools .
of the school the
you are most likely to do better in school .
they 're going to help you .
hope .
hope .
do n't know
a duty of
my parents always helped me
and do n't know ,
it is
you are raised
can see ,
and she 's got four kids .
do n't see where she is going to have much time for them
so do n't know
you have to wonder just ,
is
, the federal government
where the money 's supposed to come from
do n't know
advocate
more taxes or better management of what they got ?
we 're in a recession here .
pass the school budget this year for the first time in many , many years
even though now , we got eight unemployment percent when it used to be four or five
closer to home
it 's all money .
a couple other topics
what you can do
who knows ,
instead support the church
good job in
you could n't go to a public school in some places .
it was miles down the road
they are
you have to learn ,
would do to my child , though that
any good ideas
it is ?
do n't
supported it
and it 's too bad really
, do n't know
builds just
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school .
we have a very good public school up here
a degree out there and means a lot .
it 's a very good school .
we have some two year college also .
there is a colleges four year .
they all have a pretty good reputation .
do you think we should adopt it ?
do n't like metric system
n't
the history of our country been inches
a big advantage in
how fast they can drive and how far away is something
and it is not in our national consciousness to do it .
our land , is in acres
who is an amount of something
with you .
benefits to the metric system
do n't know
is why we keep wanting to do it
use this system , which have n't really backward still yet
it 's just pride of
and it is .
it 's probably not as accurate ,
, probably do n't
it 's not
but like , come on you said .
have six years of college
and do n't know the metric system
and do n't care to learn it
we have a computer for just about everything now
back and forth between them
is a mechanical engineering
was designing packages for people ,
had work both systems back and forth
and it was not hard
you can push and a button
one system to
there 's a lot of people ,
you 're educated ,
's educated ,
my husband 's ,
a lot of people flat educated not
they do n't have any college probably much at all
they do cover the system
in schools
they and
and that is acceptable .
it failed too
this is ridiculous .
figure out how much gas they 're really getting and do all this
is it came on
take the pressure ,
you need twenty gallons ,
and it 's just like another thing
just leave them alone ,
their water in cups
them alone
and it just do n't make that much difference in the average life
that 's fine
may not
do n't
we are one of the top superpowers of the world .
it may be arrogant ,
us to
kind of
we can
and if it just do n't worry about it .
it is
because it is another language ,
think we ought to do with the metric system
that 's funny .
well , that 's good .
think we kept it
that 's all we need say ?
it 's been nice talking .
too
think that was good
that was the best one .
off the topic
you know .
and we were talking about income tax or something .
good talking
anyway , .
have a good day .
go there .
a bit than this time of year
think that 's true
think so we are a little ahead of schedule on that
was out in my yard yesterday afternoon ,
noticed that all grass coming up , and
that 's true .
it 's been a fun breaking ,
but the breaking is over .
of weekends the last
every time at my window it 's gray
'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend , but
for that
a little worried about this one up here
we have long a weekend
a little bit on
heard whether it 's going to rain
clear out at least by noon tomorrow
and the rest will then be without rain .
that 's good .
probably for this time of year that are under what it 's a little bit
the weather on the news in the evening
is not certain either ,
but you 're probably right .
do n't like it when it is too cool or too warm
done when it is at that sort
that 's true .
, that 's the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't very much vary
you 're probably right .
other any time of year , that is not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold .
think it was one day a year ago this week and
they said we have a freeze and some kind of bad weather
it was n't just a bad super storm ,
we see in the late spring time
, was going into the grocery store
, was almost directly overhead and
and have never known to lightening at that temperature it
that 's pretty unusual .
and you take really notice of it , too .
that 's right .
lot up high
and could n't get away
do n't like that super cold stuff
move very well when
are enjoying really this now
this been interesting
challenging to the brain
in
but talking to you
you have a good day .
are
am
it is
had it ?
recently just got
and we bought a house .
but unfortunately the house is taking up my time .
a club for a purpose
in about two years
with the guys here and then went out two weeks ago
played out there , and in a tournament
kind of
laid long enough to get rid of all bad my habits off
try a slice through a hook here
and ca n't do that
finally got out ,
have been watching quite a few videos and
not have been able to play
took out a few videos
i hope is the right track and on .
and my handicap 's twenty nine .
that 's great .
like
been , too
have got my wife
that 's going to be one of the next investments probably
get out of the driving range
we can hopefully and start in .
bought her a set of clubs four years ago
even
won the tournament the other day ,
she is ready to get off into it ,
that 's good ,
same thing here
can get out and play a few hours of golf at least
and it 's not going to cost me , really an arm and a leg .
walk
do n't ride
a little exercise there
have got the same attitude
tell ,
eight or ten years ago , when now ,
and then while finally got into it
's been my main involvement
of winter when we ca n't do it the
it 's pretty nice .
and my parents came down what
was
we 're out playing golf ,
and they 're freezing cold back there ,
got into the service
i just kind of and let it now go ,
one of the guys and then one day at work
and said
have got my clubs ,
in quite a few years
got into it , and then back out of it , and then
years to get back in there
that 's right .
really .
it 's nice really .
it is ,
it 's a lot of fun , especially if you can find .
that be the hardest thing
that 's true of any sport .
you do n't want to go out and get
people do n't want to play with somebody
is too slow for them ,
somebody around your own handicap
that 's right ,
have never yet up
with a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else
that 's true .
always .
that 's true .
on , come out
and they do n't mind , if you make a mistake ,
it 's pretty nice and friendly out there
that is so .
and you ca n't find in all sports
that is absolutely right ,
but play with the same people
after a short period , once .
'd like to work up
a mixed league
for that and
whenever that 's next month ,
and it will start then ,
of years a
and they were just starting to learn ,
and they were shooting a hundred , hundred and twenty
wo n't take it , so
that 's good
that 's good ,
that sounds like a lot of fun .
it is something we can do together , and
she does n't do much hunting ,
she could care less about that .
she does
but golf , would give her the exercise
she 'd be outside ,
give her something to do that
it sounds like we 've got real similar situations .
took my wife and along
and of the same situation .
and she talked the whole time we were hunting and stuff out ,
she 'll make if that comes along , but
but it is interesting ,
bowling bad if
you do n't
that 's right .
any novice how to hold one and learn how to do it , and to do it can pick up a club and learn right .
an in any aspect of it at all
that 's right ,
could pick two or three out of my game shots every time
can do it ,
just got to do it all on the same hole ,
it will get better , and then
and you just keep going ,
and you 're doing in .
it really work that way .
first got back into it
and did n't get it done
and need
naturally anyway
now the ball will go straight
never broke a club or anything ,
'd get sometimes upset about it , but
do n't get upset any more
and that 's great .
talking to you
bet .
'll go back to work
like
see you later .
and you are talking about credit cards .
we put up .
have one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up a delightful evening
i wish
you should try it .
done for me after
had a business going
and silver prices
had a coin shop , but
, was up
and it started falling .
started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards , so
things got worse and worse , and
and finally .
you lost your business ?
what a nightmare
it was .
it was one of those things ,
it 'll get better next week .
things will pick up .
and there were so in bankruptcy court old
was you n't
ca n't do that
you can ?
were buying from other dealers ,
and they take payment any way they can get it .
that 's a nightmare .
was getting back the money ,
were selling it
was n't just buying to hold onto it
and all other that good stuff ate them up all
they 'll send you all those credit card applications , when
out all because of course .
of hundred dollars up to
, cause all they wanted
thinking was n't a thing about it
was just stupid ,
was every time and
get good such bargains
and do n't know
we 've been getting those .
, got my master 's
and they started sending those things to me again .
they get as soon as you are a graduate student .
they did .
from their records
got back one
the bill would come in , and
'd and pay it
paid it , and
this nasty letter from them saying , you 're overdue , and then got
pay .
just in the mail
so did n't do anything about it
get two weeks later
over to our attorneys if
, and looked at that
my checks come back from the bank
they were n't cheeky .
they were ,
tell
they 're charging that enormous fee every year
so what is now it ?
or
what do you mean
for the green card
but then , what 's the interest ?
that 's the card .
of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill , comes in
there is n't so any .
see 's
it 's not too bad .
credit cards
they are dangerous .
my parents do n't use them hardly .
n't either
n't either
and is that it .
do n't want to carry money around
'll do that
do use gas cards
impact is kind of bad too , though .
you record those little suckers
is just too easy ,
that 's the whole problem with it .
you 've got cash , a little bit of cash and you do n't have
of course , you got to charge it and keep your cash .
.
got into all kinds of trouble doing that
are
my husband says
but do n't really usually consider
have now having been out of the game credit for some years
maybe that is , how we got in trouble .
, it is n't it
it is ,
is a lot of restraint but
the cash instead
with cash ?
i wish
could you 've got a discount you , could n't ?
could
have
but there 's always
especially on electronic goods
especially now .
that saw thing
world circuit or something
circuit city
circuit city
you to be in there
their prices that terrific
they used to be ,
now that all national
it 's national ?
they are all over the country now .
else ,
they used to be good .
remember when they first opened up
they did have good bargains .
or you 've probably something similar .
it merchandise service
you got merchandise service .
it was merchandise service the place to be used to go .
circuit city and came along
kept creeping up on prices , and then after the years went by
and service merchandise actually be cheaper than them now .
for much .
what we can talk ?
do you work
n't
is a graduate student
is a professional student
sounds
it is .
we were talking about that just today .
it is great .
we could be just lifelong students .
it is great .
.
you going to school
what is that ?
you 're on break spring so ?
.
ours does n't start until next week .
are
is
what do you mean
,
what a dead place
is
've got a nice little business at home ,
you getting your degree in
human factors
and what do you do with it ?
not a thing
what is it ?
it is sociology .
it is
is my master 's
so you are working on your doctorate ?
, wo n't
get a little plaque you
use a lot of people ,
off several thousand people
they might be ,
heard today it on the news ,
if it could have been me .
how much longer
and get done this summer that ?
is going to start this summer
of the year the
why
been working so much already done
that
limited application in
we 're in here , that there are in the area
you thinking about getting
none at the moment
you to
for about two years now have it
and it is
trouble with it
and so it 's a little bit larger .
that only the difference
loved it , and
really did
finally decided to go check out what was the , foreign cars , but
have always , up until now
for just one time
it 's an excellent automobile and .
prices and so forth , but
is not a real fan car
do not opt for something that would be expensive ,
think so too .
those was not good cars .
rid of it two months after
so around
have a friend that has an auto shop ,
absolutely just he and .
there was no comparison .
drive around a lot
and it 's very comfortable on the highway .
drive for ten hours or so
my criteria
probably in another six months to a year or something
'll go ahead and get it and if
the moment single
and if that would have to have something to do with it .
but do n't have any plans for another two , three years of even looking probably
cars too expensive right now even to think
ca n't remember what the name is
absolutely an beautiful automobile and well
ca n't conceive of doing that
went down here about two weeks ago to a car show ,
that 's how expensive they were .
you , and then saw dollar hundred thousand cars
and ca n't even though
that 's true .
that does n't seem likely .
is not really crazy about driving
have never so
little sports car
it was never my own car
it was always someone else 's .
that sort of thing , and
but to go out and drive had any appeal to me in that regard really
have
think so .
or to shut off tonight the system
is that
very easy when
that have a great conversation ,
and they told us that we could n't do it any more
to a lady last evening
we were talking , and
was and
was
you have a pleasant evening .
too you
take care .
understand that it is being proposed as a requirement , for young people to go into public service
they did specify what young means exactly not .
think it probably would be a good program
think two years probably is too long
think maybe a year would be , the longest
you 're probably right ,
two years might be a little too long .
and there will be a lot of rebellion in that
and do n't think they are going to be serving anybody when
that 's right .
that would be the problem .
would
n't even aware that they can do such a thing
or maybe offer them some sort of an incentive to do it .
is not sure what
pay , a salary of any kind
but that kind of takes away from public service .
that 's right .
they could probably
, and are not familiar with them to know that
is not really either
that 's right .
you know ,
that 's right .
most kids and have gotten themselves these days .
that 's right .
,
so , it 's a really tough question .
that 's right .
they could n't just take off to do that .
that 's right ,
upset a lot of people
it would sure .
given to something like that
in that kind of program
it ca n't
pretty much the way
that 's right .
not really sure even at
maybe they need publicize it a little bit better instead of making it
a choice of
and they could get some results out of it probably handling it that way .
in their own community ,
that 's true .
a lot of kids that would do it just to get away from their parents
that 's right .
that 's true too .
that 's true too .
but , they would
those programs available to do that
neither me
what kind of quality job would they do
around for their year just
or would they really make a contribution of some kind .
it 's tough .
it 's tough .
it 's tough .
know who is proposing it even or how
is not sure either
a lot more information
would be the easiest for them
it would take up more than anything time
but it would n't take up a lot of money .
and things like that
that 's right .
to school
and you have a kind of a captive audience ,
and you give them your speech and maybe little a slide show or something ,
but they do n't know where to go to do anything .
that 's right .
that 's a real waste too .
it 's really .
it is .
it 's really .
that was a big thing with him .
just do n't hear much about it anymore
do n't
n't either
that is one ,
anyway , it 's a tough question .
it 's a tough question .
thanks for your time
talking to you
same here
take care .
too you
you 've kids
we have one .
she is only nine months old .
about yet public schools
is my degree
we have a little bit of a basis for conversation .
was a substitute for about a year teacher
wanted to be a teacher
was going to like it
and decided , not for me
in all subjects or in all levels grade
took just one through six grades
was going to be smart and get the good kids ,
wrong .
my degree was in fourth through seventh grade
but .
and expected to be a lot of trouble it
but it was n't that bad ,
they call it something else .
but at the time , is that
you kind of group your behavioral problems and together
but it was n't too bad .
we got real long well .
mess did n't
get with them
those little kids do n't understand it .
especially with the young real ones
do n't like this as much
got in my certification
wanted to teach my kids at home and not to put them in the public schools , if possible ,
my reason and for that do n't like the inappropriate varied influences that you find
that 's a nice way of putting it .
you can find if you look real hard a lot of public good schools
your children on an individual basis ,
and too , most people do n't have that option .
have seen
it does n't
for the private ones , of course accepted
are we
do n't know
n't get away with the things
this kid comes to school with his lunch box and
doing with that
and he says , my father gave it to me
did n't it and
could do about it
ca n't stop the kid from money to school if he wants
have
was doing
just say he was one of those that you would n't types
could do about it , but
have the option of calling the police
and you do n't know if you were reaching them or not
maybe just and have them taken out
that does n't do a lot for them .
but it does n't do anything for them .
some of them were
had only
was that they were on alcohol or something else
but it ended up better
, do n't know
guns
and do n't know
it 's something .
just teach the basics in schools
across the board that we 've done something wrong
we here and
we ca n't balance a checkbook without a calculator .
do n't know
have seen how their school system works and
by a complete rote system
so do n't agree with that either completely
definitely but needs to be a balance somewhere
is what law school
it is ?
what you ended up
did the same sort of thing , and
hundreds and hundreds of cases
one for the whole semester
and it is , how well you can remember it all .
how much can you stuff in your brain .
and found that
never did
some of the very best students and consequently had excellent memories
as and two together as far
it did n't show me anything .
gave it up
did n't want to be a lawyer anyway ,
the degree
do n't know
what can we do about it ?
good question
money is not the answer .
there are plenty of money in the system ,
they are now throwing more money at it
things getting worse
think it 's like a lot of things in the united states
the and in the politics of it ,
and over again in the power
and there 's no way that , that can be done .
without wiping out a whole generation of kids in the school system , not
on
do n't know
can see it 's a lot better than what we have now
give authority back to the local school
right into the classroom
they 're going to get complaints
it 's like doctors in lawsuits ,
kind of
lawyers help created that .
have at least
we turned the school schools into now
we 're going to send for seven or eight hours a day our kid here
and he is out of our hair .
and the other part of it is
in the home
you can have the best school system in the world
then if it 's not going to help either .
, so do n't know
, do n't know
do n't know what the answer is
you want to do an interesting thing
they do allow it ?
under certain circumstances .
you have to prove , you 're teaching something them .
you have to follow , a preferred curriculum ,
you do n't have to
if you have particular religious beliefs and then they are
ca n't think of any examples
religious certain groups but do n't want their children in public schools
do n't think they were in this area
by the state school board
that is interesting .
a few cases about
got taken to court by the school system
is glad the parents won
that 's the way you got your education in this country .
fact this past weekend since
and have wallpaper , up
it took me and all weekend
down the walls , the wallpaper
and that have
and then took another day
just .
was the wall behind the paper
you did get good results ?
not really .
it looks so , bad
to either paper back over it
but it did n't cover it ?
it covered the spots pretty good
but it did n't just
moved we
we 're getting a house , and
this wood dark paneling at
we went to one of the painting stores
and you can get by , said they just
i
more or less .
,
it was just a real dark paneling grain wood type
and it was
and we put on
because , but it was really hard to cover
it was something like that ,
, we have n't done it when
we to make the house look nice sell it
the job was considerably tougher than we thought .
and they have gotten somebody with an estimate to come in
quoted it or something and
that 's an awful lot .
have you tried getting outside estimates to see it ?
not
now we have when a company that came out and painted it .
and it was fairly reasonable .
we have a brick house
if , it was like five hundred dollars .
that 's reasonable quite .
that was n't so too bad .
you tried
have n't
over the long way
this is not on the topic
did finish it , but
and my wife took a piece of brick
and she wanted
it is
and she took it
of paint the
a gallon of it
and it is remarkable just how close it will match the painting ,
and it electronically do it .
so , they did do a good job ?
but is it .
you put your sample under this thing
and it 's really remarkable .
and then they wanted
it is remarkable .
this look like this
that look like that
's all right , of course , and if
have you have problems getting colors to match ?
as a matter of fact is
later or so it does n't match , and
it is the very same type of painting , and everything ,
what 's the solution then ?
have no idea
the whole thing
you 'll get at it very good at least ?
you could go back and painting , over the whole thing
an interesting topic that
just 'll do a little bit here , and a little there
we painted to the house ,
painted we
and it had
we did the one wall
they do n't do that in the newer now houses
the mold , everything is white .
in a new house everything is white .
white ,
we get ours to look like
luck .
we wound selling the house up .
it does ,
makes the rooms look bigger
like it had in molding .
.
it makes the room and
is still white ,
the molding
white .
all the way around the room that makes it look very attractive ,
it explains why they have everything white
about what the
it did make a big difference ?
not particularly
because the house has so many windows
room have good the four living size
of course , at night and
we have a soccer field is about a hundred yards from our house
right at our house
we did n't know when we bought the house
do n't really
a lot of
to about three feet just the dark
and then we left above that it white
it did n't change
.
scrape having to go back some of that away and
you have to do that very , very carefully .
it takes a long time , and
that 's right .
you can work to death yourself .
so good over the weekend
it is kind of frustrating .
it is .
a lot of work
a lot of work .
go to a meeting
it 's been good talking .
to you .
do n't know
grew up in the sixties ,
guess at that time it was a changing time for the whole scene music and
have kind of gone back to more of a flavor in music county
is not quite sure
seems it , and
the pot sound music
were looking for
at the time country tell more of a story .
of my roots of growing me
become more of a fan country over the years
you take it was the type teenage years
that was my teenage years .
we 're
so we have an interesting perspective on the music on the times , probably
is just a couple years older than you , so
which essentially really was one of the nerdy types in high school
that style of urban country if there is such a thing , to
very interested in
found it for me relaxing
the classical tastes
as far as classical music to
kind of
and
have and
played a little bit of piano
continue to do that
want to do it
never have the discipline to stay with it , and
an easy rhythm and tone
and it 's something to fall into easily .
is way kind of the say ,
different periods of
by all different kinds of music
a real love for in classical music , probably junior high and high school
so we consequently and wound up playing a lot of classical music there
that got
on those classical roots , i guess
for some reason not there 's a whole lot of his stuff is about real crazy ,
but he does have some things .
think and electric light orchestra even had some real influences by classical music
some shows that television
do n't know which are chicken and in that situation egg
beach china
particularly like tour of duty
, is particularly interested
it is almost , but that the music
that could be well .
the title of it was
and if
's hear song
that 's their signal .
they can hear the music unconscious signal behind it ,
that 's right .
when you did first take your first piano lesson ?
about first grade , probably
returned about every four or five years
can play some of my favorite themes
by the pressure of other types of things
it 's a consumer time .
it is .
'll be able to do it
a mystery and on them keys .
a pretty good mathematical concept for
all the math and music people supposed to go hand in hand
but it does n't for me .
it is making connection that especially with the mechanical parts of it .
was never able to master all that
or you 're not going to play out ,
and said the folks when it came
they sold the piano ,
the only one who have an interest in it and got to , never really
in life
just some other world listening to for hours that if
's kind of like you ,
'll get around to it ,
'll do something with the piano ,
but probably .
and another we knew we just got a chance , never
never just got a chance to come out
that 's the most fascinating thing .
it 's a pleasure talking .
of luck in
take care .
you take this subject much more personally .
take back , thirty years it
is going back , too far from my parents ' generation when mom stayed home
might you if you were educated
until you have kids or something , and if you really pushed it , you taught
you were a teacher , until the kids was little if then .
you were n't supposed to want a job .
can the floors bathroom be on any given day
today is of course it and then
you are supposed to only want the job ,
in totally care days , because everybody else goes to care days
everything they need in care day know
a day really good care 's probably going to cost more than you 're going to make at the job , but
'll and
at least for a lot of women depending on what she did .
did it for six years and
for one , and
was pregnant ,
was my oldest
and it just drove me crazy .
it was so you and the kid
that 's the thing ,
you get along
for example if you 'd been a technician instead of an engineering .
and the technicians know when they are going to be there
have been better
have the flexibility that do n't really go with the family
would as long as my kids were little
so you figure one of these days you 're going to go back to being an engineering ?
you 're saying ?
are not going to go back to being an engineering
find something else
branch out
and is
interested me , and
did so that
and then did for six years that
and found that it was great , out
part of the time
wanted something else to do , and
life than here sitting with this child playing to
it is great while they are really little ,
now he goes to a mother 's day out program once a week .
of my kids both
that be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day
think
and need it for the breaking
that 's the other thing ,
they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work ,
taking care of the children are still a very important job .
do it and be able to do it right
if it 's not then mom dad or and somebody is
and
that 's the whole thing .
think that 's the thing that we 're going to see ,
is that there are going to be a lot of women ,
and they 're going to have to work to working part time it out .
really liked my job well
in so many different directions just
it was just driving me crazy .
and now , with the photography , it is working ,
and in mother 's day out programs and also soccer teams and different stuff like that
my kids , so can be in for a few hours a week day care
my husband when he is at home , or can take care of them .
jobs more flexible
think they are really going to have to ,
as well
it 's going to have to be both .
about to be the father 's attitudes
it 's too his job .
me the only important issue is the children ,
because as far as housework goes men can do just as easily housework as women ,
thanks to a lot of new inventions , housework and does n't take time as much as it used to
it 's just convincing your husband that is important or it 's important enough for him to do it .
or just think about doing it rather than having someone
you talk
have come in there specifically and say this need to be done , even though we were both working the same number of hours and doing things
this is what you do it now .
and
with a mom taking care of him
and that 's a very hard attitude to change .
they do n't look at things
and say , this is the time this need to be done ,
and a lot of that is , how it was when you were a kid drilled into you .
both responsible for doing this
that 's right .
show up a lot more now , in the next generation of boys and girls
much this need to be done , because mom was there
they were both working at whatever things needed to be done .
because it 's a woman 's job or a men 's job because it needs to be done , not
between we got a generation of what did n't learn to take because mom left to go get a job and dad kids did n't move to fill the gap in
was taking the responsibility and so
in a lot of cases
some kids having it really
some time care days are really good ,
it is someone keeping an eye on the kids
is not really the kids who is right
here 's what , and
of you that
that was one of the main reasons that
this is
when they are little the way
when they are little no one does anything
keep my nine month old from trashing something
,
i wait until
she is usually in bed by this time ,
but she is staying late up tonight .
want to have a relationship with her
my dad , was a very traditional dad
did n't know my dad really very well , and when
that and .
that 's the thing ,
roles men 's will drastically if , too
men have , but
and a lot of it is for the better .
, because we are losing on some things out , going back to work ,
almost never know
how about
.
you and both me
it seems
if it goes down , and then we 're
but that 's pretty much
so that it 's second nature
what do you use ?
it is kind of getting too slow for me ,
so i applications both on computer audit .
constantly use , and
is getting , not only our local area network , but
but is getting two separate mainframe machines , also
then gets every now the filing
and do n't know ,
enjoy working with them
there are so many capabilities out there ,
the things you can do
one of the three of us have an accounting background and
taking on the load of making sure everybody know what they 're doing so up
is the administrator for our area local network and
need and keep that going
, do n't have
we have one at home ,
but just do n't find
would rather right now , not
would probably work just about every night
they did n't know how it was going to work , so
but it is almost on them .
are looking
is just
the things we can do now and
just the power ,
is trying to get an updated machine
just put along
but do n't know if my boss will spring for it
we think about that a lot .
is that
that 's awful .
it 's not a local area real elaborate network ,
but we can share the printer
and we can
that 's good enough ,
it is what we need .
that was it and to get him to buy a major ordeal .
once he bought it , but .
it is fast ,
it has good copy .
the copy that you can .
and can use the pro either printer
in my office
we talk ours into getting a laser printer
the budget restraints and things like that make it difficult ,
they 've got really cheap .
but is
think it 's called the desk jet and
think they are about five now hundred dollars and
at six hundred dollars we got a quote on some laser printers and the other day
do n't remember what kind they were ,
too long
the real laser printer
so for charts and stuff that 's all you need .
you do n't need them in four colors .
if it was a customer presentation that then would be different .
we have one in the office
and to see if they are not using the printer
you use the system .
and wait for an opportunity to use it .
you 'd have to just sit and wait while someone else were using the printer .
they got off the machine .
, known
, known
i
came to work ,
it is part of the bank holding company
any way , i work in a big prestigious place
going waiting
come on guys ,
so when you 're behind the times in technology .
we are pushing though real hard .
are we
the entire bank 's not like that .
is one of innovation
because the senior vice president is cheap , over audits , it 's just the department audit happened to be
was able to convince that it would be effective cost and our board presentations would be much better him , but
that are obsolete
the guys run
and it is why do we need this ,
that with what we have
changing and improving so rapidly
do you want to go first ?
fitness and exercise
first you go
just .
and the doctor said running and jumping is n't real good for my knee anymore ,
my change a little bit
me ask a personal question
old how
the rest of me is in pretty good shape
left knee that just do n't want to do everything it used
you 're lucky then
was even since about two or three
they then diagnosed it ,
most people and usually
aerobics water and .
aerobics water
i bet that help .
used to do it about six times a week
and now is down to about four
tried
just ca n't lift the things
and the shock on the system is just too much ,
but it 's hard to find .
that 's right .
that 's right .
that 's right .
becoming even
you can do that by yourself , if you known
you and probably .
but you have to have an indoor pool .
this is true .
in the water
also was
in the water
can believe that
that and is the only place tried
people and .
thing is
it is .
you do use that a lot facility ?
a fairly good amount
more on the weekends ,
try to beat the traffic in the mornings
you do know if they have child care there ?
you done your survey attitude for this year
you need put that on there , seriously .
n't
was the only woman that they have in the field in a position management
actually was the only woman who was pretty much in the industry , when
used to fill out those surveys attitude , and
me , and the insurance adjusters and
my husband work , and there still
, and get
yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks
this is true .
came down here and
and they did an attitude survey six weeks after
asked about care for the shift workers days , and
you just do n't say and and
it was
we talking about
much more since then
in the dark ages
we still do n't have a day facility care
people sympathetic to it more
the dark ages it was and .
have been rated number one in the field
the baby on a heart monitoring lung
the phone for
is back
on my for the last five months with the second one back because
and do n't even know it
of course it is real easy to take care of the first one when you 're on your back .
very ,
very easy
after the baby was born , since it was n't premature , they said they would n't cover the cost of the monitoring and then
was going to go back to work , but after the second baby was born
'll and tell you how they handled this
, and was outraged just
filed my insurance claims about four months later
and they did n't have any coverage under my name
went back and
said and what the hell are going on here
and they told me your husband work here
and he 's got a good salary
we did n't think you 'd be coming back anyway ,
we 've got people who need really be working here and
'd just and
it took me , and about
could n't get my benefits insurance until
and could n't get my termination benefits either
go there .
can believe that
but i guess things have gotten better ,
still do n't think that they could get me to go back , ever again after my experiences
can understand
can understand
it 's been good talking .
how much it 's a month ?
it 's only about ten .
is that
's maybe another dollar or something
it 's no big deal .
that 's it ?
you pay if then separately
for classes
but any of the facilities are no extra charge to use .
that is cheap .
it is .
that 's really cheap .
of one or a
is so dependent these days
my position for management to domestic goddess been an adjustment
really
in a long time
it is great .
as hell when you 're on weekends there is
it would
it 's not
'd want to be there in the mornings from thirty nine to thirty ten
do n't think that would be bad at all
you could go either one , then
and you 'd like the pool there probably .
it sounds
might then do that
learned something here
is glad
you can go back now .
thank you .
thank you .
you have a good day .
in a normal route of way , how
that will be entering public school next year , just four year
in what is out there
really do n't see
the main problem at
about how
they have to make based on money to fund public education , when
get their finger out of their ear long enough
is something wrong .
what the salary should be for
have a year old one
that 's true .
have a real issue with that
, have a real concern about that
so think there 's a big concern
the new secretary of education will do something to fix the problem hopefully
, but do n't know
a lot of small issues that special interest groups can blow up and not really get down to teaching what is important
the basics are really
is that right ?
about even to know what the president 's education fitness program is all
.
and
and she said she had a choice ,
she could either
give me a break ,
the kids
and do n't learn anything ,
and talk ,
have a real problem with the whole system
the lowest paid that some of public service , employees
and they are so important yet .
flabbergasted absolutely at
she was young ,
but it is still the principle .
if she got her master 's degree of course , it would be different all .
it 's hard , though , because you start talking taxes then
and , that 's a bad word .
we might have us a problem .
there is an idea .
maybe should run for office ?
that 's true .
that 's funny ,
that 's funny .
here is that
too
there is some problems there
our small part to fix them but .
enjoyed it
too you
where do you get most of your news ?
to the paper on the weekends
are
my news from a combination of sources
take the paper every day
the news morning before i left for work and actually .
usually and then there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news over .
is probably the most news hungry of my friends ,
we do n't normally so
only to subscribe to the paper on the weekend
have to cut down to the weekend , plus after working so myself
quite a bit and that
have lately so here with all the middle eastern news
he is very , very skeptical of the news media ,
are skeptical reasonably also
but he is much more so .
we do n't hear normally a different attitude
true
they spend quite a bit of time on one story
they will have maybe two or three main stories and spend just a very large amount of time .
with the just one story
they do n't have to chop it into two minute little stories
every and what happened in every little town
it 's very much interest national news .
with these panels of experts
who , when everyone is giving some opinions
a kick out
have never actually been through a period of war so
and do n't
all of these guys do n't know what 's going on
they were interesting ,
some on what was going for me on
will admit it is interesting
so do n't have any more experience in that than you
there were some that was screaming for air power ,
there were some that was saying the air power was n't going to do it .
just about everyone does ,
but these guys have
it was for children and
the war to these in their studio children
from all over the country
they have them all , on line .
they have them all on hold
and that person would answer the question .
and very just
, the war for children
this is getting a little off the topic ,
thought that was a really unusual thing
do n't know if they still have them ,
but they were free rental , videos , which had something to do with the war .
with the children 's aspect ?
it was something for children , that they have several advertisements on television pushing parents .
is a valuable service .
or if that was a new concern with people people thought of
that type of technology was n't just at people 's disposal .
that 's true .
that 's true .
been a war that 's been so
too badly and did n't flag
tell , what
was glued to the television
will admit the same thing
these extended two , three hour
tell what
see 's
the people , and would be standing in masks gas there
and you 'd be hearing the sirens ,
was
did n't have that experience
do n't have cable
have got one question for you
you say you take the newspaper .
and then the morning news , which has a very strong subscription
have just one paper ,
or you do
are
and they are pretty close .
run neck and neck ,
and the other one has
actually take both on the weekends newspapers
do you ?
is taking only on the weekend ,
and can afford that
the news in the morning news to be better
and the morning news has just
the times to balance out that just a little bit
he takes seven ,
so he is getting all the sports sections .
really like to do work hand
what kinds of things have you to do ?
a lot of gifts baby
you do keep any of your stuff ever ?
is n't
have very little of my own stuff , and
and it is
me see some of your work
you can do it ?
is n't
do have one thing
a friend of mine
that and because she gave me that
that would be definitely something you 'd want to keep .
and it is
done or just the numbers and minute marks
the minute marks
they are like hearts .
at the numbers they are
it was quite bit of work ,
but it was a lot of fun , too .
really like doing stuff like that
what is that ?
started to say the canvas ,
what kind of cloth use that .
have gone blank just
but it is used with yarn ,
and it usually takes long stitches over two or three in the cloth openings
that is interesting .
what kind of things did you do ?
mostly pillows for
and ca n't find
it is one of those things
, did n't give them away
did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves or what , but
proud of them so when
but have
what did you call that ?
have never
probably have seen , though , it
you have
it sounded like something that would be around , i guess when .
have but never
and it 's really interesting .
baskets and stuff before
but have kind of got out of that
i use sell
too
that is interesting .
it is .
choose , tonight
that 's funny .
so many of them have now the ribbons where
do n't know how to explain it
they make hard them ?
, never have done that
those and .
would like to do those really
, have seen
ask her never any questions
she has all but under the age of six kids three
and they are a handful all .
be something that she can do easily , and fairly quickly
it 's like white glue ,
do n't know
, and was it really sure how they would last
do you know what is my concern ?
will i dust this thing
you 're right .
that 's terrible .
that 's true .
that 's funny .
it 's a flag ,
, because that would start breaking down the batting
but it 's such a collector dust to be out , and so forth .
most of my things and .
hate and .
known
is so how easy would this , thing be clean of first
that 's funny .
have gotten out of it really
do it used to quite as much
so do n't have as much time
you do n't have time .
also have two children and
you do n't have time definitely .
it keeps me very busy .
really the chance but .
it is
ca n't put it down , but once
have a similar problem
have time
or do n't want to get into it in the first place even
end lots of time not doing anything at all up and so
, known
keep telling this person ,
did n't tell you what year
what was this project ?
and it 's a picture ,
and it 's a wildlife ,
and trees
and , it 's really beautiful ,
but it 's going to be a lot of work ,
have quite a bit
it 's hard just so .
it is really a lot of work
do know
have done a little bit of that ,
but decided that is something that demand my total attention
total almost silence and so .
is the pattern
it does not sound like an easy one to finish .
it is n't really ,
, and tell
starting it even
is going to hear about it probably the rest of my life
is
may , but not just
obviously of the original time schedule .
that 's true .
just like it seems there is just never enough time to pick it up and , to do it ,
it 's hard just really .
like said
it 's hard just .
finding the time hard just that can
so many baby gifts , said
and those so do n't take much time at all .
it 's no big deal for me to pick those up and do so .
use a book of patterns ,
usually buy just a pattern book
have several pattern books ,
just go and .
in the long run
just and then use
usually do n't
and it depends on what it 's .
but to some things , especially letters .
that is , too
or have
few who very many guess designs
simple i real ones
made it a bunny
it was really easy .
just a thumb printing did .
with ink ?
that was just the ink ,
the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth and then made .
that was so simple .
that sounds
it did n't take at all anything .
did you use , a stamp pad and ink .
just like
's see
how do you feel about credit cards ?
personally do not care for them
for a number of reasons , of which one is the extreme interest rate on most of them .
in favor of them
of view my own personal
on the order of five to ten billion
had for at least that
you do frequently use them
can put it in our budget we 'll use it
it was interest , cents on our visa
just a few days on our grace period
so we 'll pay a little interest this year , but maybe two dollars .
but we do n't like to do that at all .
about the same way you do strongly real
we have several credit cards , though .
of department stores a
but , we use the same way ,
paid before it
that are usually
and then use .
hotels and so forth but for .
knew , but
have much that credit , going in
, sometimes would go over
because me in a big way hit
that 's good .
pay before it far in advance
when they would send the bill , plus they would automatically convert to the exchange rate .
only the time that got to be a problem was so , if the exchange rate drastically changed
there , it had fallen two or three francs to the dollar and when .
in that regard catch
maybe it would be more than that .
especially ,
really got caught
try , but not lavishly to use them , in that regard as
that 's good .
are
very well known
for a long time
's business in the speech and also
was going to do this
and so , is that
what 's the word .
your speech is very exact .
thank very much you
is one of the old hands in the speech business
have been doing it for twenty some odd years
in work .
do this part of it before
eight a good minutes about
think so
we 're
you have a good evening .
too you
talking to you
same here
take care .
are
is great
you do have one ?
do n't have one at home
with one at work
at home have
what do you have , at home ?
have the same kind of thing at work
that 's what we have .
you do use it a lot at home ?
really .
is an accountant
i working at home but
so you are a lot on it .
use for that it quite so often
some of it for some personal things
personal budgets and things like
are doing a lot of taxes , since it 's tax season
a lot of that work on it
took our taxes to our person tax
and she also works out of her home .
the software that do the taxes and is just incredible .
it is .
expected to go and drop off the stuff and go back two weeks later
you can .
it was great .
you can ,
that 's right .
is that
would having one at home
just do n't know if we really would use it that much
started working at home
then , we thought we can use it for some personal things .
it took a business application to justify the expense of it really for us .
and it 's got some stuff on it .
a nice word processing little on it , and some things and stuff budgeting type software
and do n't
it just seem like a lot of trouble for something at home .
than try to sit down and to figure out how to use her computer she always seem to have to do better things
those things by hand
as quickly
my boss bought the software that his checkbook , is on a disk
he goes in his checks on the screen and types
and print out on the checks
order envelopes with the windows in the right places
saw yesterday morning him over there ,
and he paid his monthly bills ,
he wrote all the checks on the screen
it out like ten checks and
they are
just them and off .
going through a just on the printer continuous thing
in the envelopes
there and they went .
can balance in seconds my checkbook because it 's all in the computer
and there is not going to be those adding mistakes all we make .
exactly is that
looking for those
he said this way there is n't any .
it for you do it .
are , some advantages to it
is just a matter of
'd have to say
or perhaps is using it for education .
have a year old four son ,
and we have some education programs that he likes .
we have another one who plays , and
and he really like that one .
he 'll be even more and more too as he grows up .
that 's right .
that 'll be great .
and
started about three years ago ,
and she had to have a computer .
it was a necessity .
she going through college without a computer
is going through right now
everything be typed
.
have if one at home
do n't even know if a kid college would have
do n't know
even , probably not
and they used to have it probably .
a major paper ago research
could go back in and move and change
unfortunately went through college together in our family
he while got his master 's degree
had just back and then we
all type of his papers
it was n't that long ago ,
his master 's papers and things on a typewriter but .
have a computer back then
cut in half at least your time
at least
at least
of course and then you have some changes to make and do over the whole thing
you take out a sentencing ,
you take it out print it out on a computer ,
take out a sentencing on a piece of paper ,
over the whole thing
that 's right .
was working in high school ,
working in an office , right after
continued working for another year probably there
and we did everything on a typewriter everything .
but it 's amazing ,
then , when , someone would have you type a letter , they did it right .
the first time .
there
really want to say ,
you and
that was it , and
just send people and back now over and over and over and over
it looks
but sometimes it gets a little out of hand .
've got a secretary that sit here that are keeping metrics right now , and keeping up of all the letters over i type
could n't read
or just one because people change .
believe
and it 's ridiculous
that was the week high , and
that bring it to people 's attention
that is exactly right .
are several weeks 's worth of data and then in addition keeping copies of all the changes to show look , this did n't really need to be changed
this is ridiculous
this time to now and .
, that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it was a waste to change
anyway , maybe it 'll help in some way ,
but do n't know
even with the few disadvantages like that
without a doubt
without a doubt
would like to get some day one at home
we 've got a year old two son ,
, and so would like
sources from outside would
think they would get a lot out of it especially when they are in school
too
, too , .
that sounds like a great idea such ,
it 'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it .
it was always fun and when we were in high school .
we could
and do n't even remember now what it was called
people all over the country to
you , and have little your own code name
'd and
'd and
you 'd have five or six or seven people talking , and
and it was just great fun ,
you were long distance on
it was like a long distance phone call .
twenty minutes a day to
that could still add up .
it added up big .
was
the time we were visiting our father in the summer time , and so
do that under normal situations
to watch us grow but you can kind of get all kinds of stuff when you 're doing the father guilty complex , because he 's not there
that 's sad .
it was
too you
have a nice days .
too you
movies .
have n't seen lately too many
have kids
and we saw the rescuers under , over the break down
you take to movies
no kids .
and got all kinds of awards and things academy last year .
but this one was excellent .
and ca n't believe good how
it 's just the special effects .
in this movie , and there is this boy
rides on his back
through the clouds ,
and the bird then coming out
and they are flying all over with it .
there must have been computers or something for animation this day ,
it was a good show .
that 's not a recent movie ,
enjoyed , but that show
several years back
but the plot was bland ,
was
chop them up ?
chop them
all of them and could be in that fashion or category .
were selling drugs ,
he got and
he start out , and by fighting to make
and then to where she is just to help him out
do n't know
much about that movie
a it was them
but wo n't go see
it was worth the buck i guess .
you went to the dollar movie ?
right after showing up at the dollar movie
are usually not that great
let
see me
another i movie
have n't seen that
have one that ?
absorbed all of that movie in one sitting
the music and
and it had an excellent story line .
everything about it was good .
a direct and acting movie well
is that right ?
'd recommend it
a little on
then what movie but is n't
a little bit that way
have no objections to it
it is a matter of your taste and ,
they just because x has a connotation with it , changed it
they do n't even on those type and
really violent movies type
that seems to be the norm of most movies ,
let
have one ?
have
that was pretty good .
the book before
knew in the story line going , so
but they changed some things in the movie .
it was n't
the book , were better than the movie
thought the movie was really good as well , but
waiting for the movie
do n't have the book
n't
about one or two thick novels like a year that
about all the time
a good i show
all the special effects with
that was n't in the water
all those underwater scenes
that was in the water
are pretty good
is that right ?
did you see ever the original one ?
did n't
the one part
it does n't say one part ,
but it 's
what is about that ?
is not sure
ca n't remember
have seen it
in some sort of bad dealings with somebody
he go underground
he uses and all of his special effects knowledge in doing what need to be done .
fool people
and where he needs to go .
all the tricks
that sounds like an interesting concept .
but you need rent first the first one .
going on in
if that 's the second one follows the first .
do n't know if they have the original actors on that first one to that one
coming out with all these movies desert storm , this summer , too
expected those
doing before their dealings with that
not actual names , will be used .
they will eventually come out with the proper names .
it ,
with a lot of movies
though it was such a rout .
, do n't know
latest story
is that right ?
do n't know
that 's just one of the many rumors that float around .
what or read .
pretty much used the tape up .
it 's been about five minutes .
it 's been nice talking .
.
next and around to you on the
to keep on watching those movies ?
have little two kids ,
but they are not in public school yet .
you have n't so .
everybody else 's complaints as to what is the matter with either their kids or the school system to
have so
you do have kids age school ?
both out of school
such as ?
there was just over the years
the teachers or did n't seem to be teaching anything .
of course , it 's
things
and were never one to believe everything my kids said about something
and yet .
heard a frightening thing
did n't hear it actually
for a math or science teacher a
this would be frightening .
do n't know anything about it
because , just because a subject matter does n't mean that you can teach it
'd know how to handle that kind of a group of kids
think in fact
is
this period of
of educational and economic background of
used to think
they can get a real life experience .
and they are in the same classrooms .
next year 's
weed you do
some of those , certainly have a lot of difficulties with all sorts of things
in some cases quite
statistics that my throat fell into my toes just about
is that
was teaching chemistry college ,
do n't know
that 's an idea .
some radical changes
and unheard of
here
and you think about that .
you 're going to have twenty hands up there .
it 's not
what has the educational system
do n't know
that is interesting .
do n't know
mine did not fall into the gifted category .
do n't say that
never either so
but they managed to get through , although not always with flying colors .
she and showed that me a paper .
what she had
read and
while it had a little grammatical few problems , and it was n't very long and so forth
she gave him an f on that paper .
when a student is trying to pass
and you give them
you telling that student
you 're telling them that , as you might well forget it .
being
a process thought how to write an answer
and they can grasp the points .
or they verbally can convey the data in writing
and that 's what 's really scary .
at an early age they can
and they know how to read .
, just get really
into a military family
and do n't know ,
so do n't offend anybody
but he had trouble putting on paper things sure .
did they and for him .
they said he is great in electronics and
but he does really need the basic skills .
six months of composition writing in
the kid barely really made through high school
and did something about it
them be the last ones to
so do n't know
it does
can see why if you 've got little ones just coming along
there 's a whole lot of stuff on going out there .
a whole lot of stuff
and pretend it does n't go on
says the old social conscience and then
do n't need to work
should maybe
or , says the other part of me .
what do you think about it ?
about the concern for
privacy .
ca n't
of course , that 's true , certainly
is very much
really
just do it
have to take for kidney transplant medication
is going to be taking that the rest of my life and
if you have to have a drug test ?
yet have one
the drug random
have , but
happens if
is on drugs
and go through this , thing that they have me
check out
seems to me , but
agree that some innocent person , might be victimized , by a false test
some guidelines could
, perhaps one or more two stages where tests further could be done
because of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in the transportation industry specifically
going to effect anybody but himself and his own family , perhaps even that he might be on depending on the kind of drug , but in
so in the way he work on that 's going to show up anyway
but there are so many things that would make it .
a training engineering
pro very much
and this is
this , sounds like a slogan for the government
a war , drugs against
it 's horrible .
sitting next to you not or the person 's on drugs ,
some drastic steps at
the drastic step be that you ca n't work , if you continue taking drugs
it is as simple as that .
make it , not necessarily difficult
make it difficult enough
it 's not glamorous .
it is glamorous taking drugs ,
or at least it seems that way .
according to what you
are we kind of lucky
to our church
it is the son and so on , and
he was friends with my children , and
most of these
the education system
and have a little more contact with that so
he may be a productive members of society and never really .
the hospital regularly fairly think he is not sure if he is going or not
and he is now a young man about twenty that really just got down the wrong path
would ever his problem
him make what it could do to people in the work force , but seeing who drugs did to
it 's horrible .
then ,
let the second half of the question
what , do you think ?
that one on a test drug
treatment before thing dismissal type
need to be more than one test ,
and need before anything drastic happens to be some measure of certainty
things , perhaps denial of insurance for someone such as
it would be unfair ,
medication , for example , or even people who might be of the gay community , on
is not an advocate for that particular segment of society , and
think there does n't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination , but
it makes a bigger problem .
we talk about what , if any , rules that we should say
do n't really
was about to say
it may be it and
that it could happen .
would be some measure of protection
are you then if you 're going to stay clean and straight
measure of
but ultimately the reward come down .
agree with that
that 's very true .
it sounds
think so .
think we did pretty good
that is about it
guess if is that we all
long enough
it was nice talking .
it was nice talking , too .
the present time
i kind of
consider that a hobby
, do n't know
that is a really true hobby ,
that
it does n't really have to matter ,
it could be working on cars could be really your hobby .
really
that a little bit too
, do n't know
told to work
pay to have
because it seems always it goes wrong when you try to do something .
got a couple months to go
our seeds inside
that 's right ,
you would ,
we 'll start inside them
usually right in the house .
try to set up a greenhouse on her back deck
a storm wind
but she 's have really good luck .
next month ,
a couple weeks and of may
you can leave them outside .
of may the
remember it was on into may before it really started warming up , and
so we 're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts
that kind of the weather a little bit moderates
a little
my brother live ten miles from here
and , his crop gets
he remember lots of snow .
,
do n't know why we have so much going for us ,
n't really
just wrote
they have recently layoffs
never here , never never any layoffs
is a technician
when they start getting rid of technicians ,
with them .
, i guess
on stick .
interesting thing that
grows
and you can make
with the glue hot gun get
it is sold in the stores and nurseries hobby .
it 's got a kind of a peculiar to it smell
at first is why do people like this
but it 's kind of a nice smell after .
people , put in
realize for what it was
'd wonder what is that , and
it is , like a thing fad .
do n't know
have never
it is .
maybe that 's why they are so slow .
on the stuff or something
it looks really potent stuff .
think it is the greatest stuff in the world , though , but
make all kinds of things with it
all kinds of
want to start a business doing it , almost
so when it comes to starting a business
that 's a big step ,
it is , especially .
you make some stuff , after
you start looking at it , then
go , this is
of the house , away from his wife ,
because he 's a seasonal worker ,
he in the construction work .
it is almost a pattern up here , and
your fathers
their sons
is
for weeks twelve off in the winter
this guy , was going nuts and
all kinds of furniture for his kids , and he makes
and he makes little kids ' furniture .
gets right
they may be the same kind of people you are talking about .
they 've got twelve weeks to do something ,
and they 're making furniture and just things like that during the winter
and other things during the summer and then
plus he is getting on in his years now .
he 's not that old ,
needed an extra boost , he
hard work , and it is .
make something out of it
men ,
and it is
do n't see scrap around too much
that is something .
was so planting some trees out back tonight as far as planting outdoor stuff , matter of fact ,
and it 's nice really out , tonight .
it 's going to be really dry ?
trees plant in the fall
do n't
the cold weather can kill them
do n't know where they came from
and they come down here
and they 'll sit in the nurseries here
'll go ahead
that 's good .
they say , you can plant them in the spring or the fall
it 's really cold
it is down here , but done both ways .
depends of just
time you have to do it
do flower gardens
she gets right into it .
she spends lots of money on them .
a lot of that
their whole house with flower gardens
during the summer down here , the normal kind of flowers , there is
then the heat and set in .
it gets ,
most of those kind of plants just alive staying barely
we 're in a relatively new area .
we 're kind of out of the tree natural area .
we 're kind of up on a slope .
you do n't have a lot of coverage tree
very few trees
going to make because
this was pasture land ,
my grandmother passed away ,
where 's this ?
idea of
tell , what
the two cities very identical
that it is
it is not at all , dry .
it is
where it is ,
it is
and work garden
it all
.
do you have a garden ?
try to grow a garden vegetable
the same thing
have just a small plot
it is ten feet by five feet .
, have two plots
ten one 's by ten
.
area more than
it 's all my backyard .
.
.
it is cheap entertainment .
get out in the open air
it is ,
that 's right .
but i i wish have sometimes more space .
go ahead .
of things , a lot of food
want to plant something , and sometimes
that 's right .
that 's right .
a lot of room .
and it takes up your whole space .
it sure does .
what a mistake was that .
they run just over
.
it was very good
a lot of your garden area , you say
the first and only time
we do n't do anything exotic
the basics
that are too
my wife used to plant a few peas snow .
really do n't care for snow peas
just a plants for herself
peas
a few peas out
you really did ?
,
.
until the warm weather enough to stick
you can get an earlier harvest by doing that ,
probably .
you can get a head start on it .
but a heck of a lot of work is sure .
,
watch them every day
'll do it again
is sure
.
from work
and and usually then go out and just walk around the yard and inspect it fiddle
you got to inspect it ,
and the kids , want to swing
them and on swing .
my own
and do n't have a sprinkler system
do n't
especially ,
had a sprinkler system
and it 's nice really ,
it dragging hoses around
you and by the time you and that off about is up .
that 's right .
that 's right .
it 's nice really .
for my wife started
she and move it ever around other day .
my own yard
do n't really enjoy doing that
enjoy having a nice looking yard ,
just do n't
the real hot summer months until
my excuse for that
, so to have
have done it myself for
too much money but .
it is kind of expensive ,
it is .
of course , the chemicals when you buy them themselves , they 're too expensive .
but it is still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself .
that 's right .
really need get out and apply something ,
and the weed come , up
that 's right .
have and of all
that 's right .
's kind of bad about that
having a lawn service
have now , but the time
want to spend the money for it
get out in the morning before
that 's right .
can do it on any most days of the week
can start in the evening after work doing it when the days start getting
that 's right .
more an hour
rollback an hour
that is coming up pretty here soon .
it is this weekend ?
do n't know
it 's pretty soon .
really do n't know
it on the news the day before
think it is coming up here soon and
believe it 's too
you having any trouble with bugs in your garden
not a whole lot .
seldom use anything harsher than seven dust
really do n't like to put a lot on it chemicals
do n't want the bugs eating either it again , but then
they come in spurts
did n't put on anything
did n't have any problems and
covered just
did n't go out there for about three days
went out there
and the plant was
that 's right .
that quickly
really going
and , they have a good appetite , .
really .
like twenty of them off picked
and have been watching them every day
and have n't seen yet any signs
is going
did something different this year , a little bit
it is kind like this shape box ,
other various things and
raised it up .
the good stuff .
are hoping especially with those tall big sides on there
'll at least
built a box
have
have
but you can improve your own soil there
that 's right ,
really .
you know .
that 's right .
n't
did it by hand ,
small enough ,
do just by hand it ?
it was n't too much of a job .
get one of these small little ones , that
it would be handy .
and or it weighs twenty pounds , something like that .
my neighbor across the street have one .
out there
it might be handy ,
have never seen one
have a friend that has one
it 's a fairly large to one , and
, just go to my garage and grab it if .
that would
that would be nice .
we have a garden for years , and years and years , of some size ,
ca n't remember a year when we did n't have one of some kind
what you got have growing right now ?
snow ,
what kind ,
me
you do grow ?
we planted them for the first time this year .
the best
we tried to find last year ,
too long
and could n't find
but we 've got some this year .
peas snow up
a small herb garden on
.
they are up
ca n't just the ones from the grocery store
that 's kind of a , let down .
i bet ,
they were .
that 's right .
a lot
sure .
some turn red
we did , that too
some we do green and
make a colorful salad too
put them in salad ,
making me here
try , before
and
we had much luck with it
we 're going to try it again this year .
they have some little on them buds
hopefully they 'll do something .
sounds like you have a real good garden .
we enjoy fooling around with it .
, got
got the peas
planted and potatoes too
never have done potato
, had a huge garden
the potato ,
they are delicious
you do n't seem to get that much for the space ,
.
it does take some space .
some potatoes
've got some tomatoes growing , still in containers , and
.
got to wait for a place to free up
will that
will that
they are expensive .
known
they so expensive
or something
really do n't know ,
i guess
and we see how that work
that will be interesting .
an experiment .
what 'd like new , every year that ,
that is interesting .
'll
what would you 've at a party dinner ?
on having dinner parties
can prepare ahead of time , but when
that sounds great .
it 's really good
and then to make the sauce when you 're ready to serve it
that is one of my favorite things to serve .
think it probably would depend on whether this was a formal or a dinner informal party
but would n't
by people , i guess
is just a fan seafood
back from the grocery store
you 're not
them dead
do n't buy them that way .
eat those because they are bad for you
'll remember that
it does n't happen very often because it 's just an accident
but then it do n't if straight eat it .
lots of pepper
just boil
and they are
once they are real easy
do n't know
.
for a party dinner coming over if there was a bunch of college kids they would
was working environment
but that there is a , big thing over here .
still have
it would just so
but do n't know
guess was
and but
and they 're more expensive of course
it really do
another where the husband is the one
is that
is that
really enjoy it and
's got it with kids
but really do
and we have them back and forth for dinner over
was really a lot of fun
i bet
that could come up with the best recipe that got pretty competitive as far as
it did
we tried
that would be fun
it was a lot of fun
it
it was a lot of fun
it might be the candlelight sometimes
it might be or something back out the picnic and sometimes
that 's right
that is fun
it was fun
all and they were doing all
that right sound
up on that
it does
make sure they did n't have again to do just
make hot dogs or some potato chips
about how much
doing now than
but that 's because my mom just started working only
when she come home in the afternoon
have things
try to stay out of kitchen , but usually
that 's nice
do n't know
it can be if you have the time fun
a lot of times it really is too much of a rush but
she makes this sauce meat ball whenever we have the big get-together over at her house
do n't know
they absolutely delicious
she cooks with alcohol
do n't know
would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
it is in the other room
do n't know if we have enough time for it
it 's real easy
that would
adds that and
so it 's not a rich thick type of a sauce
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency
all the grease and then drain off
am i freeze
it may take a half for them
in the sauce itself
and it 's real good
that sounds great
and then freeze them
that would be great
in a big company
and know my future husband will be
is sure dinner parties will come
you 'll meet friends
invite the boss over friends and at work
is in public relations in school
is my whole job so
so is going to have lots of dinner parties
and have to take out to eat 'em
'd been properly raised
did n't know about
so there is anything else
covered
it is
they are
will
sitting with a cast on my leg here
not exercise is supposed to do that to you .
that 's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way down the hallway .
do you do anything on a regular basis ?
, off and on
off and on .
right now have been off
to go over
three times ,
try to go over at least three times a week there ,
and try to walk at least five times a week
do , when you
, have to ask you
if this , and is getting to
we 're not
but is
it 's not that great ,
but my husband is working over there
but n't just
weight just so much
that 's true .
or is that
do n't use the free weights
like and over the master there stair myself
those too
and when the pool
and the pool ,
that 's great .
known
this is really a stupid thing that happened ,
just and and as we were jumping around or doing something jumped up
known
the emergency room and was like a bad comedy show .
and you did n't do anything said the doctor .
so we went to one
just a big old cast on it and .
put a big cast on it
for about four weeks .
four weeks ,
, like
that much , though not
off just too for about six months for
but was pretty much in shape walking
and , this is one of those things ,
, was real embarrassed
felt kind of stupid , but
those things
.
is glad that you could say
started jumping on it again
that did a lot of good ,
is sure
really .
aerobics
and do it
the music and that kind of stuff
the music
my foot about five years ago but .
broke my heel
and
how you 'd do that ?
in
was up on a ladder
my full weight on
do for that
they did
they have to go in and do surgery .
a pin in it
not so the impact , would be good .
under my heel the cushion permanently as the damaged .
any jumping up and down
that make sense .
but terms of other things playing a little bit of tennis
you can do not stuff like that at all ?
have n't
do n't know
thirty years since
into just walking and stuff like that
that is probably the safer way
is always
and there was
and can do that
is
, and are not heavy
just you but when you go easy .
just do n't think it 's healthy and
all the time
it is not really good for your knees .
that 's the other reason ,
and do n't know ,
the floor was uneven .
was the two dissimilar floor coverings
, is a handicap access at first after it happened and
and then , said no
that 's just the way it be constructed .
said when a few things to him
said
that a lot
like
do you like that , what that voice said --
you have to
, want to
it make me feel better .
is that
do n't have as much energy
but it is around the other way .
all the help
that gravity factor ,
known
it does get you .
he said , you 're at thirty something ,
but you 're
that , do n't worry ,
he says , even if you were n't doing anything that would start to you happen .
a lot .
because , is not
is not heavy ,
need start pushing myself
and he goes , human nature .
that 's true ,
.
except for the guys .
real before early
'd like to try , there
stupid or what
is at least one of the fellows who are there at night and on weekends real helpful
there were some girl there .
have been there maybe a dozen times
it is terrible .
that 's true .
either , have n't
far of a drive
and is glad they did that
it is not at all anything worth talking about .
'll drive over there and check it out
to me all the
was one thing ,
and they are going .
like a lot dance
'd hate to give up
but he kind of said something to me as bad as your foot probably not about
but he said just to me , maybe you ought to try bicycling
for you will probably , because it 's going to be real tender .
he told me eight to twelve weeks .
anything not
of weeks a
the more they tried
could n't adjust that
known
this stuff than
not fun .
now obviously walking
a slight from
if it matches but one .
anything else about exercise
other than
too me
me too
need go actually get something to eat here
it is great though ,
do really enjoy it
thank you
what would you say your opinion is on control gun ?
do n't know
's against it
wanted to do the right
the ammunition is so probably .
wanted a weapon
how do you feel about it ?
and think they need that
and have a pistol
'll use it ever
and my bullets to my little pistol like you 're probably about three years old .
in a year or two
like to have them handy , but
thought that were really good and
two weeks to process your request to buy ammunition for that system .
your local area to do that
of anything like that
that would be nice .
their way the guns or one
.
maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it is quickly to stop the buyer from buying it impulse
and you can get really cheap them .
known
and we bought it there .
how long was the waiting period out there ?
about nine days .
that was n't too , too bad .
think you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it
are you not
you do n't have a gun to go shoot the next day it in other words .
the same kind of job
i
never got
, but do n't know
or at least ours does .
a little thing on
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get .
and the spread change .
it does n't have any automatic to it features and
from the target
tighter the that it gets and
it 's got a hell of a kick to it .
my husband had a gun police at one time .
shot thing that one time and
me down
,
is not sure
you do belong to a gun club
belonged
we ca n't just for practice and target .
of expensive
but it is well worth it .
you can go down and shoot up against a bag sand and some targets
have n't got the time
there is an annual membership fee that are fairly high .
you pay because of time first members
plus you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in .
he went to shoot just at targets paper .
but they used speed and accuracy and all that .
the gun clubs
of that never
is that
it is even after you just like putting someone in an automobile that do n't know how to drive
because you give him and a license .
.
he could not only shoot himself .
he was fortunate .
he could of hit something else .
he went tumbling along with shooting almost off his foot down the steps .
broke , he being , mister cowboy
ca n't remember what the term was going around
it was about four or five years ago .
that would be a good idea
about private citizens selling a weapons ?
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me .
how do you feel about that ?
believe there ought to be legislation
does your system or
that 's because we did that a hard one .
think there ought to be some ruling against it , but
have no idea
have only one gun
the gun one it was in my name
's ?
and do n't
think it 's voluntary
my husband has a thing .
my kid 's jumping on me .
ca n't talk hardly
my husband feel they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns .
that i guess
it 's just like the social security system .
once they gave a number everybody
is one at birth and now
once they have your number , and they have your identification .
identify , not to the government yourself , and they know if you try to do anything like .
about you .
and , that 's true .
my training of
is
that 's all right .
you were talking about people about what the federal government know .
everything , half the time from
probably .
a little bit
but they could know anything , and everything about you .
'd like to have my gun and
to banning them
of more that no one knows about a
are not
n't either
wanted to
put up just the money
we got a thing called a shopper down here .
it 's a bargain thing .
guns in there
five a day to seven guns
and there 's no waiting on that period .
none
we sold a refrigerator through it
and it took all of hours twelve us .
to sell the refrigerator ?
and is sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
think and the federal government 's really far away from control
probably should n't say control
regulation
would n't want the federal government to have
so that they know who has what weapons
with you there .
they do have already control over us too much .
we could look at our paychecks and see .
vote , unfortunately , we
ca n't so too much complain
so guess .
do n't know
what kind of movies have you seen , lately ?
a lot ,
you have obviously kids .
that 's right .
have n't seen yet that one
that 's an excellent movie .
the movie last i saw was sleeping with the enemy .
was that good .
but was
that 's good .
were expecting it
it was a pretty good movie .
is ready to go
work that way yet out
it is .
and .
said in fact to
them like that
all ranges of movies
like that
the whole time
it was really interesting .
what other movies have
the new one , of course .
that is , any good
is going to be seeing it because in a week ,
and that she 's got two boys .
is going to see the next one
did n't see the first one
my husband said it was about the same lines .
then it wo n't be too bad .
so .
it was n't necessarily impressive ,
but it was better than it could have been .
you know .
my daughter , is five
she understood everything .
almost all movies with
really enjoyed she , and
higher where there was some things that kids did n't understand adults , did
liked and that
think that is important
that 's right ,
that 's right .
it 's pretty good .
but we take her to just about every movie ,
and she does really good .
we 've taken her ,
and she does real good .
about to say , not
what was the last comedy you saw ?
what was the last comedy we saw ?
good question
good question
we do n't get go often that ,
something on the tip of my tongue but
one and it was .
ca n't remember
in fact
said that wrong ,
that sounds but good .
that was n't really too bad .
he is this actor
and he is playing a cop .
he or are hanging with a cop trying to pick up the stuff around .
think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
there was
he did n't look like a cop when he did it .
is that
was the part
these movies and cop
and thought he did such an excellent job of going that not far
he was looking more like a cop by .
of the movie and all through the middle part the
but he was n't there yet .
you could and tell it ,
a real good
think they did a real good job of that
like
and there were some definite tense moments , with him in there .
, now that , we saw
took a date to it about a month ago , but
so have seen too not long ago , the second time it
it really was
enjoyed it really
the bad thing that it was about
of surprise at that
and watch over over
maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction to the first time .
had just gone overboard the first time
do n't know
so , maybe
maybe .
though it was a great movie .
loved the movie
did , too
is looking forward ,
two naked gun and a half are coming out .
those movies
, too , .
you have to see to catch everything twice those .
you have to see them more than that .
did n't catch
it 's amazing
, too , .
those movies
, too , .
really .
so are looking forward
try to go a couple times a month to see a movie .
it 's just getting so expensive .
is
was going to say
not keep doing it until
easily .
that near expensive .
living in such lavish style
it is as simple as that .
we just keep breeding them .
as long as we keep paying for it the money , and .
so guess .
that was an excellent movie .
we 're waiting .
do n't
do n't
that needs the big screen .
truly really
was my first instinct
but is glad
and
that was
truly did
none at all
best actor on
ca n't believe that either
you know .
it was just too perfect at all times .
that was
they should n't have done it .
the supporting actor , he was good ,
the guy who got it , but were better
can see that so
you think my daughter would like it
she does n't
no problems .
they 're fake
and
they do n't stress very much , but
n't really
if she enjoy movies think it 'll work pretty good
that 'll be good .
it 's a long movie .
going to be longer
a lot of
may have to see
that 's true ,
of that even
is they so
and you can at your leisure watch it that way .
you ca n't
and is a good idea
videos not cheap either
the idea of getting a little extra with it 's a good idea and so
known
is n't
we have cable who helped a lot .
, too , .
but not enough .
we keep holding out .
probably is so
can understand that
it is that time of the year .
just moved into our house recently
in the yard and things out on the house
think when you 're in college you have more of a regular schedule in terms of , you can watch every week
that makes a big difference .
so
was home
watched on a regular basis more things
when it first came out something
you did ever watch that all ?
and away from that kind of worked
kind of
but .
, known
tell , but what
with our kids about television
one night , couple weeks ago , and it just happened
and they wanted to watch ,
and we said we 'll sit down
you want to see
let who are on
we could not find any kind of redeeming value in it .
that .
so it was prime time ,
we have and cable ,
and there was n't anything on any channel ,
it was just dribble
it was n't even funny
that 's right .
it was n't creative ,
have seen
know
are saying
that 's right .
became i kind of
we do n't have cable right now .
's and it
the whole moral situation , everything is just gone one whole complete direction different .
and we do n't have yet ,
the same way but .
something is going to be good and interesting for the kids
some of the cartoons
even n't going to understand kids and half the humor is in there
none of it 's probably damaging , lot of times .
it is
and that was about it .
but it is , just one of those things ,
if you 're in the room
but it 's such a shame because it could be so good .
that 's right .
put up with it
that 's true .
it 's hard to believe that nobody can be any creative more than that .
that ca n't be the problem .
it must be the marketing pressures ,
is glad you said it
the exact same way
some shows
involved in the show
known
why do you do this to yourself ?
why do you do this ?
, known
there is
like stuff that 's on great performances ,
and , we used to watch quite a bit and things like that mystery .
there is an idea .
that was just the rule .
watching something , if they saw us did what you see on what 's new , and
the children 's program at the time
we give a little oral report before we could watch our program
that 's pretty good .
a fan sports
ca n't handle very long it
, is a fan sports
is any more , but it
probably watching commercials , it would n't be so bad if half of the time was n't spent
you are missing an awful lot .
, but do n't sit down
that 's true ,
'll sit down for the big games , the super bowl , and the championship things like that
but do n't follow any team
check the next morning
knows how everybody are doing , and
good humor once in
that
you do n't have now cable ,
they have a comedy channel now
you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly commercials , but again
's and then
did
could tape things
fast through the commercials and then
a lot of time that way
it works ,
bet
but , that take too much planning .
, do n't know
if there is any series try
are still that real good .
it used to be real good .
it is .
it is .
think it 's on tonight in fact
, just got in from outside
is so kind of out of it
things like ,
consider intelligent fairly humor
you can tell ,
they pick up once every in .
such a long it running program is n't .
they do have good for that writers .
that makes me think ,
to try .
we try to stay up , too .
it is getting harder and harder .
ten years ago was n't so hard to stay up .
it was just too automatic
no matter where you were you stopped
is it come around again
it is gone through cycles .
of years in the middle there a
but we started watching again .
but it is different real show than it was when it started .
it is now funny ,
and it 's better ,
but it 's real different than what it used to be .
that 's right .
that 's right .
but you ca n't be outrageous .
there is only so long you can be outrageous .
that 's for sure ,
that 's for sure .
a few things around
hunt hard for them
pretty much like you
so guess .
been good talking
good talking
take care .
too you
what kind of cars
have two kids and
and my fiancee has two kids
so we need a car that is big enough for six .
and two weekends and so ago looked around
this program cars
and , with a new car warranty , they come
and it seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that just .
that 's a real good deal .
and it 's been a real good car
what it 's like and new
and it had only very , very low mileage on it .
think he got a real good deal and
of course , they are
think so it 's a pretty good option
think so too .
they , or used
they new
was the new ones there
the guy said it 'd been on the lot about thirty minutes .
he says it 'll be gone in , probably
and it 's probably gone by now .
those things
the price drop in half already .
so it becomes more realistic then .
is thinking about on my car next
a used car 's two maybe , three years old , but that 's low mileage and in good shape
getting a car that is that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why the person who owned it did
or is something wrong with it
that 's right .
you have to take
that 's right .
you can reduce that risk by having the car
can if any financial interest in it but
and then you 'll have a realistic assessment of what you 're getting .
about how much do they charge to do something like that ,
you do know ?
that 's not bad .
it 'd be well worth it if you are considering buying a car .
would think so
would think so
it , is kind of hard for me to talk
that a good
a car for
got because it is almost four years old ,
that 's right .
but it is still in great shape .
is to take what you can do and put it in the bank for three or four years
just cash for it and when you 're ready to get pay .
if , it 's going to hold a pretty good value resale
should n't have trouble at all too much and if
would think that 's true
you could on hold for just a moment ?
were picking up some noise background , and
on it up just so
they are trying to record with
that 's fine .
the car
having any mechanical problems
that 's right .
never in fact
that 's right .
and it 's been kind of nice ,
is not surprisingly after four years and enough
that 's right .
that 's right .
.
bought three cars
always bought them new
ever bought i drive to work now
just that turned ten years old ,
have done things
but , it runs fine ,
it is
if , it seems
is going to have to do something sooner or later
what kind of car is it ?
you going to trade on this one new it in
it is actually , in better than my car condition .
is some money from the bank and so
so she is going to sell rather than trade it in it .
that is probably the best thing .
four to six hundred dollars in a trading
more than as learned that
go there .
you can do much better .
care of
a better deal on your new car you 're buying ,
they going to give you that much less for your trading in
that 's fact .
what thought .
think you 're right
interesting .
kind of
did you use it at the place car shop .
before they have that it is .
and they have a little filing where they said
that 's right ,
what you could expect , and a percent over cost and then options at cost and everything five said they
so figured out
that 's good .
you are going to get a car that 's got flooding damage or hail damage
and they just laughed at me .
they and gave it for that prices to me .
pull it from town because that is where the white one was
is that right .
one at town north and .
it was so that same car .
got the car off your lot for that price unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flooding damage
all the way to the bank and .
did
they required that you to do .
, took it and north
saw sure that guy , and
and he recognized me .
and he kind , saw that car
and is sure he knew probably what was going on the very next day
that 's right .
he said they are not .
is so
such a deal .
loved it
sat , there
'll bet you did
it was kind of nice .
talking with you
talking
have a good evening .
good luck in your hunting car
you much
anything about the proposal myself
their proposal or one
either have n't
a stint primarily in
require most countries
mandatory for at least the young men
do n't know about the young women ,
they have too
a lot ,
everybody do .
do n't think it 's a bad idea ,
a lot teach .
is that right ?
a lot of growing up did .
i bet
you have to .
had my father
did n't do it myself
and that 's
he came from a poor immigrant family ,
the family , was n't wealthy
, he put himself through school ,
to do it himself .
and he did .
and he was very successful .
my parents , wanted to send me to college
and were dead set against it
got and , in
started to work on my education so
was my job course
that 's pretty good .
but have been in school ever since
that 's good .
i guess
do n't know
there are other kinds of service to the country that could be done ,
working in the national parks , working
pay people to go out and when we are paying all these welfare recipients , do
take them to old folks places around
we 'd learn to other people in this country service .
get something out of that money
country would benefit ,
, worked for the unemployment division ,
that right
and he had all kinds of horror stories .
and these guys , get
also good for clothing and gas and things like this booklets and back in those days
all this stuff together
and have a hard time dealing with that
was
do n't make that even
known
and somebody is taking that away .
there are being spent on the bureaucracy and six or seven easily probably times that amount .
no doubt .
it 's ridiculous totally ,
, was going into public administration
could n't stand it any
, is that right
the kind of
there
, you wonder we and when you 're writing up
number for the recipients dollars
number dollars to administer the program
ridiculous just
this is ridiculous .
it is sad .
it is ,
it is pathetic .
be a different way
be a better way
but it 'll never happen .
these people out here getting that money
the required young people to do service to the country
should they get in return , i wonder what .
would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance and
give an incentive
something that 's going to help them along the way .
'll and eventually help the country because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people , too
look at the statistics ,
that 's going to help and only .
it is sad .
's , adults , that ca n't even read
and we 've got the lowest rates of the civilized in science and math countries .
becoming
we 're becoming a country service .
as we were
we were
and now we 're going to do it because everybody is at the game beating us not
them how to do it
and they did it better .
as that
because they have the ambition , i guess .
as that
which is good for them ,
kind of but out on the other hand
it is terrible for us .
think if young people have service the country might give them to more ambition
and it can be good for them , too .
to the mall
known
for what
known
give me the money
'll teach them something good and
it 's so they can get them out of the house
that 's my other complaint .
n't any more
they have relinquished their parenting .
one of you the other subjects 's do
as a substitute for a year teacher can say
with somebody else about another that time
was when and working on my master 's degree in math
and just .
most probably that have fun
because it how to do things helped me out
'd and
but for what
a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
that 's a sad thing to think ,
and that 's
and that
it is in a way ,
but you have to look for yourself out ,
that 's right .
that is wrong .
should garbage men
should teachers
.
an absolutely necessary job
but there 's a sense of priorities here , too .
what 's more important ,
picking up the garbage or educating our kids
they have both their place .
that 's pretty good .
the way unions have gone
unions needed
and they served a good function .
and they served a good function ,
enough laws on the books but now that
and they are there only to perpetuate their own power structure .
, the people there went on strike against the management
it was a manufacturing steel place ,
this was during a time when the steel import was so cheap ,
and they were having a hard time .
you come back and get this stuff done
we or else is going to be out of business .
they would n't come back , and
so they went bankrupt .
and they lost all their jobs .
and that is really what happened to the steel industry in this country .
so many times you have the coal miners and workers steel going out at the same time .
that took care of that industry and
that 's right .
'll and tell you ,
now they do with the imports that
have never
and do n't think we will ever
it 'll be a tough road , though .
it is here ,
and only because they did it .
that 's about right .
back to
think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service ,
do n't care what kind it is
it teach them pride in their country .
and in themselves , too .
that 's right .
you could organize something within just your community .
old same thing
that 's right .
and that is a great idea .
and say we need somebody ...
on an exercise program now
i exercise
i lifting weights
occasionally run
's
what else do do .
golf some
on work and out .
keep with a little bit that up
how about
are doing right now are walking
, have got a month old nine
and is
so , and at the time , walking seems to be the best .
does n't too tax me
aerobics in
like like the association group
and that 's my favorite way to exercise .
is that
do too walk some
my wife 's about five months along
so she 's been walking quite a bit ,
that 's a good exercise for that so .
do it together , too , i guess
my husband , and i use walk
as well as they used to ,
so , and we very seldom get together to walk
it on your own schedule
or do you go to groups
on my own schedule .
but it was
save the fees ,
and we buy some of our own equipment
you can i guess and then .
've got a weight bench ,
we got my wife an exercise bike , and
and that i use
it 's a little more convenient ,
you do n't drive to do it over
depends on the person
since the first of the year , but neither one of us have been going .
we 've been paying these fees and not going ,
if it is so kind of a waste of money .
you 've really
of times a week a
maintain the shape you 're in just
have two friends and
the same ages as mine
we 've been walking every morning and
when it was cold we would
the little , for one reason or another , we , last
so it 's harder when a little
have got other people with me
do n't
.
too if
and wo n't be consistent with it as
i
you exercise between
up pretty well until
started and having pains
was doing aerobic exercises as well as the walking working out , so
and had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful
and was going to wait until about my sixth month and then start that
did , with the second baby that
went to my exercise class , and one day
was and then
so , it would seem to be real beneficial .
parts of a lot it
your first that you are having and is this ?
you have been through it ,
parts of
with one pregnancy exercise
was three or four times easier
having both of them natural
the first one was natural
going
and it 's rough
not as bad as
think the exercise helped and
that 's good .
my wife been working with them
then she could go if she was interested .
so she could find out if she wanted to go .
it is kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the ladies except one other , were on their first pregnancy
so it was and educational as well as exercise beneficial for us .
at least it 's
do n't want to exercise
it 's too much work .
different things you can do
that 's right .
sometimes a good job and if
reached our limit
is not sure how we have long been talking
about six minutes or so
it 's been good talking .
been good talking as well
hope your baby come out well
, do n't know
but we bought a van last year ,
and there were two other couples with us
and there was
and it was really nice .
some of the state parks nice really
some of them and n't
of them some pretty rough
they do n't
some of them nice really
they have showers and full bathrooms ,
, but do n't know
a lot of
like the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that
there was n't any electricity on the site camp
it was all right , but
we spent only two nights there .
would n't want to spend more than two nights
would n't want to go for a week ,
but two nights is good .
there were especially by
so , it was pretty nice .
it is right on a big lake ,
there 's a lot of boating out there , and
and we went up there to be able to get on the water a little bit hopefully
but it was still too cold .
it was pretty early in the year .
it 's not bad that
but it is still
, do n't know
have a tent
fluff in it out in the backyard and stuff and
it is
so , you ca n't keep the dirt out of the tent .
do n't know
we have a year old seven ,
it 's pretty funny ,
to stay out .
we have a dog
and that 's just as bad as a kid about .
they like to play in them .
can you really
do n't know
it 's hard to keep the sand and dirt out of it really other than .
we were just going to say
, he was play in the tent
, is this not working ,
you ca n't do ,
all you get .
plus all you get ,
we were at a site beach , too .
you did have , a big tent , looks like a sitting area type like a room two type ?
getting those one for the yard
we do n't really have a problem with that in these areas ,
noticed that and
east back before
they are terrible ,
they 're really terrible .
some of them known
but there is one who are out in this big lake
and then there are other this one what 's more up in the mountains
and there 's no bugs ,
that 's the whole thing that everyone , told me
was going to go to state park , little river ,
that place , is great
there is no bugs .
because we were having a really big problem here up in certain areas ,
they are so , bad .
it 's a really nice area ,
have been there before
and you can
the very
it 's really strange .
they must work ,
when the sun sets
and then they come out all .
have you ever taken any of those lights ,
you ever used have those ?
never really effective how
bought them
sort just them
so , we did n't really contribute it to that .
little all this buckets smoking
they work ,
but they are
is in my paperwork here ,
i waiting for a phone call
find my most important parts
is going to go ,
wish
really and could
you can talk about that a lot ,
do want to go again , but
we just moved into a house ,
in the backyard , maybe
less than two years ago
so , we do n't have any children yet ,
so , it is easy for you go .
we have a van
can just in the back of it bags and
do n't know
that sound , but
it really do .
that is to have a nice vehicle where you can have .
and he 's got three kids ,
so , will his kids in the truck , in the back of the bed sleep .
those , they are kind of nice
but they are also when .
they 're really nice , but when
it is
a storm came in
in the mud
a really violent storm like a tornado
just to stay in your truck .
theirs was so bad ,
and they were close to the water so the water , was coming up
and they have to get out of there .
then , were they successful ?
they were .
it took a little them , but
they did
they ended up getting out .
helping , though , several other people
so , .
was their truck
like to get right on the water ,
really like ,
like , they are than anything
just ,
they are pretty nice ,
a little house except
the one time that we got one , it was overlooking the water and
wanted to get one right on the water
we have too an electrical storm ,
watching it sitting there
about in that storm you
more of a threat to their own people at this day and time
how do you feel about it ?
they do have a major internal problem .
everybody want
can understand
think their biggest problem is just obtaining food to live ,
think as far as being a threat to other people in the world
, so they can do with the rest of the world , as soon as what
communism is
insofar as the strong holding that they used to have , it 's pretty much on the way out of the door
think it will be on the way out eventually if
too well set with their diplomacy regarding the , outcome of their affairs
he is going to have more power ,
and think it 's a step in the right direction
the prices on their food and goods
that is incredible
but they have to go in the direction of a market driven economy ,
and they have bite for that the bullet .
but do n't
that 's all they got right now .
that 's their ray of hope .
so they 'll go with what comes through .
between the old guard , and the new glasnost
he know how to keep the peace on both sides , in order
kind of
are saying
i
that 's the situation and that he , finds himself in
and he is a tough guy ,
he 's been through it .
overall think he 's been a , good for the soviet union figure
that makes most severe the problem
.
somehow , just , it does not get out to the market the way it should
think it 's a lot of bureaucracy , one thing , and then all the corruption
that 's true probably more than
you 're going to have with every society that
we 're at least
but it 's very secret ,
and it 's been going on for years .
you ca n't change .
where people ca n't survive ,
too in that direction
big time ,
major ,
is that
to the ways of the western world
how much the average soviet technology to though
probably not enough ,
is wind , of what they are missing out on but
they are
a lot of them missing those household items
we consider , normal everyday things just
because we 've been got
this is true .
this is very true .
human nature though
or you do n't have what other people have
.
the original question
we do think they are a security threat ?
can go too with that answer
the soviets really want to blow up the world
and they 're just like us people .
they got
their pants on the same way
have to eat else , and
was going to get to talk
you be
probably more interesting if
was afraid that we might get into an argument
of generations , for the roles of women , the last
or they may have elderly parents or all sorts of other things
me though that women 's roles changing faster than the men
think so .
extremely difficult up to these days
think sometimes
you do work outside the home ?
you do have children ?
they getting older now
not quite so as much of a responsibility
still they but
they take time , still
on the house around
was and for
and it was tough .
sometimes other things
is it hard to find a balance there
think in some ways , but
you do n't try to do all of these things
and that is where the problem is really .
, have little children , four and one
decided it was very important to me to stay home and
is very active with other people with my age children
most of us , and do tend to stay home
there is a almost friction between us , but when .
necessarily , even though
it is almost as though it puts on different sides of a fence you .
you having to defend yourself
and you are so wasting your time , just at home
it 's a tough one .
have done some of both
was when my kids was little real
think the longest , was less than a year
still was able to spend with them those first months , but at least
of doing without things
the money was the issue .
would like to have not in some ways to work , but even now
it is kind of pull and tug ,
have a lot of interests and a lot of things
of accomplishment with having a job and all that goes with that a
that 's true definitely .
work out of my home in fact .
is an accountant ,
taxes and bookkeeping
it is a way for me to stay home .
work out for my family
have my cake and too eat , kind of thing it
that 's a good deal .
you do
things going to change
i hope that they will change ,
it 's going to be a slow change
my circle of
decided not to have both , of the parents
helping centers child care at the place of employment and things like that out that will help out
thought
, we setting a trend
care of the children
those who may not do it and even be spending more time with their kids and trying really working harder at making all of the family things
but do n't know if they 're going to give up their careers ever
like it 's sort of
they give completely that up
it 's a very personal thing .
you talk about families and raising children
think children have a hard time
think they need security
, do n't know
speaking from my children , .
things going to be a certain way
of sorts a
we will see .
are hoping to see more female leadership in our society
like the fact that you are beginning to see gradually ,
but it is still a long way from being what it ought to be .
the numbers
talking to you
, like to keep in touch with
the others
adopt teams , when
it is helpful .
have so
you do keep up with the statistical stuff ?
do n't get into that too much ,
will in every once
or things like that
to going to work in the morning as do ,
it is essentially trivial statistics
do with games winning and losing run one
of that one
, did n't know that
be a real good statistic
it is
but it 's a reverse indicator .
that 's true ,
they do n't have the offense to get out or have the runs more ,
how you can draw a conclusion from it
training the following year
running that the following year , you 'll have a bad year if
leaning toward the truth
, do n't know
i kind of think it was necessary ,
is not a big pure power hitter anyway
and for the downs swing
think a player ought to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch to do it ,
strikes two on you
, if
he was not much of a player team anyway ,
the strategy of how baseball work ,
but it seems that they can sign him tomorrow ,
and he could go in the next day the team ,
and , and they put
and he hit a home run
he and become a hero of all .
that 's true .
and all that he had to do is hit the ball ,
is hit it
a couple times
an interesting concept of
with you but
of what baseball part of
and a home run blasts
and that 's all the game 's .
there are too
men on
and somebody hit a solo home run
if , but there is something wrong definitely ,
runs enough to be able to win in this day and age
they have several pitchers than last year had badly years
and they 're these cycle pitchers ,
beer one good one year ,
so he is very much due for a good year .
that 's a good question ,
just go out and give anybody not a chance to beat them ,
up and there
and they 're certainly intense about the cardinals
up there 's baseball their life .
everybody do .
that 's true , too .
think that 's all they have
it is
everything is
out that way ,
visited him ,
but it is interesting .
are
definitely
have got family who live up there still in fact
have a good year
have , but
and they are so far
that 's a good indicator ?
it can be .
kind of really on , what they were looking for
in other words , then if it does n't really
but they 're going to play , then that might be pretty good indication , if they were playing the people
losing streak in the first of the season
had some people who have real breakthrough years
and the question is
you ca n't .
on who would be in the world series
is not sure that they said this last year
and so they may be even better this year .
that 's a good question .
and that 's going to be an interesting question whether , or not .
they 're doing though the right thing
with their farm system
their farm and like that
there is enough money ,
that is part of it ,
and , his argument is the ownership is not inclined to lose long enough to bring the big dollars in big money
that is probably true .
you would agree with that ?
, is beginning to agree with that
spend , , as far as the big money
you 've just if it is necessary to spend it .
have if in other words
him go away
they spent more money , last year than any other team in the league
of the league the
so it 's
spending money do n't guarantee you winning a pennant .
it does n't really ,
think you 'd like to do well them
you got me .
where the average fan ca n't go
once , and
it 's a little bit like any other sport .
but how often do you do that .
is that
so many games in
they ca n't afford to ,
their ticket prices as high as anybody else 's
it is a small market
if not more than most , other cities as many
fans older there
do n't mean older ,
wrong with it what should be done about it or , if anything is wrong with it , and what we can do about it ,
fantastic .
is about the funding of , the school system right now
evidently that 's a big problem .
it 's amazing ,
pay nearly enough to be doing what they 're doing
was
and
but would n't
all the problems
about stress and pressure
tell , what
probably half what most people
and we are paying basketball millions of dollars a year for what people .
that 's right ,
just do n't understand that
you do have little kids or what ?
n't sure
about two years
that is a teacher school ,
three year , almost four and two a year old
this not coming fall but the year after that
is it so
so we are thinking about that .
what 's going to be like that .
is they
they or going
in our child 's education
we do n't trust the school system , which is very sad ,
if it does n't start at home , but it 's not going to go anywhere
that 's true .
if you can not read or write or understand .
give me a break ,
is that
my one thing
could n't believe that
is going to be good for resale value , so on and
that age , who is going to be a definite concern to
before you talked , about the school funding .
who school funding will be necessarily the best way
what 's going to have to happen is that there are going to have to be for grade school and high and high school junior kids tuition
if they start raising for property taxes ,
right now .
and do n't think any politician is going to do that ,
and the only thing , they would be tuition ,
it will work down below if it works at colleges .
having kids in school , of course , which is probably the only fair thing to do
they pay out even more
really hurt because they are the ones that will probably have to carry the brunt of the load the middle class people
that 's right .
that is just unbelievable .
ca n't believe that
high and high school
you never heard about that .
we did n't even think about it .
what and now .
, got that kids
or even being a student
going to be like for my oldest son , when he goes to school and that 's what thought it
what 's going to happen ?
are afraid for him to go
again , but you ca n't hold them back there .
and you want to encourage them to be active and everything in school ,
all the pressure is going on , with all the negative things
lot and tougher than
that was twelve years ago , i guess .
so it is now different lot .
and is what it going to be like in another twelve years when my oldest son 's in high school .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
are afraid to think about it even
is that
, but do n't know
is just to keep encouraging them
that 's all you can do .
still you got to be their best friend
or dealing your parents drugs
drugs , they 're going to be in even worse shape and if dealing .
that 's right .
the schools do n't really encourage
good them values like drugs bad
have n't been in that kind of environment for a long time ,
but just , it 's amazing ,
to teach good them values .
that 's true ,
that 's true ,
, if someone else is going to stand up and say , of course .
think and
start at the home them
the deep rooted values
and that 's about right .
that 's all you can do .
that 's right .
got to be going ,
the call
to you today .
to
have a good life .
n't
so can work at home
and it is
but it does its job ,
what processor does it have in it ?
, do n't know
it 's so old .
what kind of work do you do on it ?
ratings television
and i some ratings and processing
and running some software
so it really do n't have to be anything sophisticated .
my husband do too
have , a fairly fancy one ,
of our customers for new products
and have
it 's so kind of fun ,
need buy a computer for the house
have n't just but
'd like to have one for the house too
i work on the computer all day at work
do n't want to come home and have to work , too
in 's your husband , what group your husband ?
something with the defense
defense systems and electronics group ?
something like ,
so their name changed
.
the peripheral products division
i work in the airline , marketing group .
did n't even know they have anything like that
so many things that
they 're into so many different things ,
he had , one of those top secret things where he could n't talk about what he did
for
jobs but then .
half the stuff to do
he is a programmer ?
.
design engineering software
have a degree in management information , which are computer , but
of it the programming
have been at it for five years , but
could n't get a job right now probably even
it seems like it 's so much changed ,
such advances in computers
your husband use ever so
he does bring with him a little one home
he brought a portable one home , sometimes
but it quit working
so he brought it back ,
he brought one another home
but they did give him a new computer at work ,
.
and here in temple
those handy really
nice ,
he does n't have one of those ,
what is that ?
he does n't have one of those .
they are pretty handy because when i travel , it is easy to check messages ,
to your computer and dial in the phone
my husband , do n't have to travel
that 's good .
some people
'd like it , if he traveled a lot
.
, would love to have
but they are so expensive .
, do n't know
depends on what you consider expensive ,
real stuff high for now under two thousand dollars , which it would have been six , seven , eight , nine thousand dollars just a few years ago
compared to what it used
but it 's a lot to put into one .
is n't just two thousand dollars to a lot of people pocket change
that 's right .
it 's not .
it 's not pocket change ,
so it 's major .
when they start needing something that will be different then
.
do some of my husband 's papers
his but was
did a lot of his papers
they come in ,
how many different types of packages
at home ?
really do n't use ,
most of it 's just stuff that 's been written in house that i use .
those two
for your entry stuff that you are data or something like that talking about
, survey system , just in-house programs to do what they
worked for this company before
me working at home doing things other
that worked out pretty good then .
it did .
a lot of
something really minor
but , it 's something that nobody else , want to do
and it 's time consuming .
so , it keeps in the company you ?
that 's right ,
it gives me a paycheck ,
goes for three to four weeks , three times a year
the ratings television do n't come out all the time
they come out , only four times a year
could bring a home computer and do stuff
phone 's
do something always
right now , we 've got several new products coming out , especially
lots of
you take a home computer to work
need be at the office , too , but
deal , with other all those things that happen
i bet
was it and
have done before that , a couple times
that would make that much easier , but it
just home instead of bringing home a computer
that 's right .
do n't even have to go into the office
maybe have been into the office once in the past three years
whatever courier or
that sounds nice really .
it 's real nice ,
, just to deal with them on the telephone
know who they are talking
most of them
ca n't say
a lot of people around there changed
most people know
but do n't
me by name and phone voice
got a lot of folks that
them by the telephone
it 's been good talking to you ,
got
we sort of stayed
we tried .
it 's hard to sometimes .
we 'll talk later to you .
a nice ugly
sounds like you like to read .
read as much as
would like to either
, is a single mom
have always , but
what do you like to read ?
what you 'd called self improvement type of books
that .
my interests
used to read just , mainly fiction ,
read a lot of self help
what kind of things have you
all kinds of things for helping
that
have n't yet got through it
you have n't
you would
as dealing with divorce ?
kind of
a good self but .
self good help
that sounds good .
and it 's one we use in our work
do n't
like in the book mall store family , something .
is writing it down
really good
what kind of
or should we stay on the topic of books ?
should stay on the topic , probably
do read with some of the things that
a lot of kids with various problems
dealing with sexual abuse
a lot of the i books have been so .
helping them to feel good about themselves
they are at a bad stage anyway ,
and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would
to be in that profession and be able to make
it is sometimes
and it is sometimes a struggle .
to be sure ,
is sure
is just the type of reading you only , have been doing
any good novels
so many books like
it 's hard for me to do a lot of reading for just enjoyment .
joy just reading
there
that 's for sure .
in fact ,
have never read it growing up
just finished reading for enjoyment so that
is that
and it was good .
she did n't enjoy it much , ,
much satisfaction with her discuss it
thought it was real interesting , but
read some of my texts literature from college
have the time to do that kind of reading but
known
think of some of my favorite other books
lists
hundred books that three
just want to read that
it and down written .
a next to my bed
do so
get a little bit of ways in a book
have to start on another one ,
it 's pretty tough to keep up with .
, but was trying to think
he also wrote people of the lie .
was thinking
, bought one that
and did n't
there is another one even sounds better , he wrote
the whole concept of
just someone recently said
in beginning weekends experience
and it was that said .
his latest book , are excellent just
and his whole idea is
beginning weekends experience as one of the places
that is interesting .
it was really .
ca n't think of his name
pardon
it 'll come ,
but he wrote
mind expanding books
different than ever so
ca n't think , though of what the bat his name is right off
but they were fun .
they were just for fun real books .
not very long
really started just
you did
.
just recently .
and got so
right now have to do with the art of selling and
was
stacks of
is going to get to them all
never ,
never
never there is
do n't think so
you took speed reading .
do n't think so
do you like to read mysteries
a little bit
trying
he write novels , the eye of the needle spy
find his books enjoyable
that kind of stuff
i read , in conjunction with my wife over last year vacation
it 's called this present darkness .
it is kind of unusual book .
that sounds interesting .
it sounds really good .
one in the next six months
it 's so easy to get caught up on just reading for your work or self improvement ,
of reading the fun and of .
that 's true .
very easily .
we pretty thoroughly covered the topic
too think so .
you and for call .
check out
you like hope .
thank you .
you take care .
too
a lot
, like to read too
were trying to think of some while it was talking ,
it took so long for someone to answer ,
the newspaper and kind of
but
living in a small pretty apartment
and would have to put away stuff
have two cats ,
could n't really so
reading is a little bit easier to work around .
pick up it
that 's right .
should be doing
that 's true ,
the same thing
in what you 're reading so
do n't have the equipment here
and did some of that
what else have done ?
on the wall
can use right around the house or give away as gifts mostly just
i still and
have taken the time to do something like that and actually
and enjoy doing that
it 's just the same thing old ,
it 's just getting the time to do it .
never right
always my picture and .
completely work out
it takes a lot of concentration .
a little for a gift baby thing
you must pay all attention to what you 're doing .
it 's a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be .
it took me quite a bit of time .
though , this wo n't take long at all
was wrong , but
it took
but , it was fun ,
enjoyed it
was a big one ,
it was of a lady
it was just too much to start with .
and still have n't
better up because it was just so difficult to this
kind and with it and discourage me from doing much of
that 's pretty understandable .
but it does n't have the specific stitches .
a little bit
that a little bit better the variety of stitches , and in that stuff and .
embroidery or something
is trying to think
was tonight ,
was
how about movies ,
you do like to go to movies ?
,
do like to go to movies ,
like to rent movies , so
right now , and have the movie channel
quite a few movies
got a going collection of now tapes , of
visit my parents , and .
of them a
was over there ,
said some tapes with you and
borrowing always so .
like to do with plants stuff
, have a lot of plants in my apartment
, and have got a pretty small porch
but have n't yet done that .
kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time ,
think we 're probably that now past but
should probably go buy some
might enjoy
is about pulling weeds and things like that
it is the hard work .
, like
's and
it 's nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers , so
also living in an apartment .
've got a few plants here ,
but is not really knowledgeable
real good them if i water
and they continue to grow .
have accomplished something
,
not enough experience with it
do n't know either too much about it
little my porch plants to
in my apartment , of which half the ones , and then do n't look real healthy
but do n't always get direct sun except in certain spots
that 's my problem there probably and so .
you have tried growing any , fruits and vegetables or anything ?
they are pretty big ,
it takes up a lot of my porch area , and
but my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house .
and that he had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff
anything like that since then
considered last year it this year
have n't done anything about it , but
just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch
lots of sunlight here
and it 's pretty large .
'd do something , be motivated enough to do something it would work out well
goes , but that motivation thing again
enjoy with my cats playing
do n't know if you 'd called that ,
have two cats , but
gave them , and
so they are a little bit angry at me .
in the water
they did n't too much like it .
that 's good ,
it helped because it 's the time of the year that they are shedding a lot
help them
so now , they are
but they were
, like
but we do n't have any yet .
we have a month nine old with another on the way
or get into a house with a little more space .
'd love to have some animals
like dogs
and my husband like
we reached a real agreement on that yet
a place where we can have both , it 'll be great ,
, like
but do n't think an apartment is big enough for a dog since
to me , dogs need a yard , even little dogs .
they just need a yard .
can cats deal with being inside all the time just fine .
just think dogs need be outside , though , but
with you .
would definitely it if we were going to get anything now be a cat or even a bird or a fish tank or something small
that 's an idea
, but she wo n't take care too much
because , you never know when , even a cat .
they are not likely as
'd and probably by biting or something respond if
do n't know
that 'd be my self defense .
think we probably reached our time limit , but
probably
and are out anyway of good ideas for a hobby
it was good talking .
for called
still
you do
.
, too , .
it is kind of hard to find sometimes
you do work ?
and have a family ?
, do n't have a family
it 's hard to cook a full meal
so .
think for a dinner party is one of my favorite things baked chicken and white wine
where you did get your recipe for it ?
that an international cookbook
the cafeteria , and is real good about putting out recipes
a month , they 'll once put out of the month a recipe .
and they put
tried and it
and it was really good .
and it 's a red wine .
's and
and the wine sauce over the last twenty minutes it and then
wine over it and then put .
real good
and , it 's too easy really
what do you use ?
what do you serve with it ?
what do you serve with it ?
like to serve a wild rice with it
that are too
this is
is that
just do n't think you can go wrong with something like that
it is great .
've got a good dessert recipe
what ?
up in a bowl glass , just
we should be there ?
that sounds
it is ,
it is great .
try to avoid making anything fancy too , that , we 'd like too much and eat too much
known
you make it , so like a crust pizza
you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice
and ca n't
kind of
your fresh fruit on that
that over it
that sounds great .
it 's really good ,
and it is
it would be pretty .
it 's real colorful depending on the fruit you use .
that would be pretty .
we 've been cooking a lot of , breasts turkey .
it is for you just so much better .
and have been making a hot sandwich
a little mustard honey
that sounds great .
it is delicious .
would n't mind serving to anybody that
it just do n't take
it 's really good ,
and it is good for you really .
it is
out and we
just do n't feel like eating out ,
just until it .
was going to say
and it 's real good .
in the refrigerator and it keeps .
how long it does keep ,
it keeps a long time .
and you would n't have much together to mix that even .
it keeps a long time .
is
have
?
'll bet that are really good
it makes a great sandwich .
is going to have to think of that
we 're getting company tonight ,
.
that 's kind of hard .
they 'll eat fishing ?
she 'll eat fish .
to be a dish lots of vegetables rice
that sounds good .
you do garden or not ?
n't
our neighbors next door
a lot of times
because it looks real pretty and put it on a plate glass
everybody and love it
and it 's so easy ,
and it is delicious .
is that
it does n't sound like it would be hard at all .
it is n't .
where you did get this book cook ?
got it at the store checkbook
all these beautiful pictures in
the creative cooking course .
might have to visit the book state store
are it
have never
either have n't
are this edition
it 's a big book
but it was not expensive .
a lot of chicken
, too , .
we do and eat a lot of pasta .
without red meat we said the other night it would n't be too difficult to do just
that 's right .
do n't think it would
we do n't have that much of it now .
and lots of chicken
some the other night
it was good ,
but it did n't have much beef in it .
we used to stir fry a lot ,
especially a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes
it just take everything up .
on the weekend to take off a day
cook .
a least cook
so that we can have .
have you ever seen any put out by junior leagues ?
cause , we have some local ones .
they great
, are looking for this recipe
is a lot of my recipes and
good
got a real good one from a doctor 's office one time and
, is that right
what was that ?
it 's a baked bean recipe .
let 's see , and
you buy the canned baked beans ?
you give it a little more body
that sounds good .
so , to always keep open because you can find my eyes .
try to keep a little in my purse notebook always so
what basketball teams
try to follow of course
but they do n't have much of a team usually .
a football team than
on basketball nationally never .
that 's true .
've ever seen on basketball nationally
they have a really good team last year ,
that was about five , six years ago by now .
that 's not too bad .
in they and usually .
about how you ?
is the bulls you are talking ?
as i teams college know as far
have been pulling for duke for about four years now , but
is that right ?
but they 're on probation this year
you ca n't do much about that so .
you did watch the final four this year ?
watched all three games of that
every game ?
have the teams that was there
they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
maybe they were , and
but was
watched that game
and it was a good game .
and it hard fought game
, do n't know
as far as playing together as a team that day , but duke seemed to have them off balance
more of a gun running team they
have always what
them play half court it seemed
do n't know if they were necessarily behind ,
but they were n't as much as ahead .
and that meant that they have to play a second half
they had to do not
they did n't have to go through some tough games during the year
so that is a terrible time to have to deal .
that 's right .
that help them a lot
thinks the difference in that game was probably
it really could have gone either way .
do n't know
probably .
a super for them
to me he 's not
a real forward
they 'll make ,
that 's going to be a war .
that is sure .
it 's going to be a great series .
by the home team
think what has home advantage court is going to win
one of those two probably will be in there ,
see me
, so do n't know
so that might help them .
that 's true .
he is starting to play , they say
but he 's been kind up and down all year .
game one he 'll be playing
and then the next time he ca n't
, so do n't know
is not sure about him this year
is that he 's right now starting to peak
that 's when
he is , starting to be more consistent at the right time of the year .
the dark horses ,
against any team he would
that 's right .
that 's true .
then , he is now gone
they do n't so
anyway for
thought he was gone period
, did n't read the story
that might have been what it was ,
meant maybe what they
if they did , they 'd still have to pay his contract .
they may have done it .
you never know .
it was a lot of money .
is that
he was n't even playing .
a good job what he had .
is that
his sweet position
, it is n't it
l a
who is the one who are doing so well this year , other
they have the seeing eye .
have
they , or are not brothers
how that work
said , but they 're doing extremely good right now
do n't think there 's any clear pick
when it is on the line .
they find when it is on the line
what makes a champion i guess
that 's true .
it 's been nice talking .
to you .
take care .
take care .
are
there ,
mess with my phone here
you do have children ?
have one
about how you ?
have three
you do work ?
.
,
i work
so yet he is not quite two and a half
the majority of people , probably have
a day from care
he started in care when he was eight weeks old days .
, do n't know
have kind of the opposite opinion of most people ,
this real problem with
, that one person
always figured and at least in
are if one bad apple and at least other people can see
they can watch ,
i just kind of felt that the chances of something happening were less and always .
care days
all about the horrible things that happen in centers care days
the mother and the daughter and the son run
it 's a thing family .
never in the big ones really .
so , is that
had just excellent luck
have been so happy just
obviously , but
or , you would n't have him there
the same for the first two years
and it was
loved it , and
was so happy there and
and the woman who owned it sold it .
is going to keep an open mind here ,
was n't just
was n't
and their attitude and philosophy was
there left him for about a month
moved him , which was an extremely traumatic experience , and
but , he is well done ,
it was ?
of months now a
feel and just
that 's great ,
that 's good .
about how you ?
you do work
or do you get with them to stay home ?
got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years
my oldest one , is now ten and a half
were about ten years .
was able to do that
could n't just wait to have kids
was so anxious to have them
so , it was really great .
of work the
i bet
was two and a half and only
she was already two and a half ,
she was n't so
a baby
felt real good about that , so
pulling out , just in my hair
about a year and a half ago
worked full time all last year and
, and now is going to school part time and graduate school
are working part time and
knows how that goes
, are still going full time
have only half salary time , but
you did have last summer ?
we did ,
we have all different things ,
we sent to camp them .
one ,
one , my daughter go home
and my son went to camp
forget what else did we
but it was all really expensive .
that stuff 's expensive .
it 's really .
they are so a year older ,
my son and will be , nine and a half .
can leave home them ,
is going to leave home them if
that a little bit
that right now with
is that
went back to work , really in a day care home situation ,
too , with it really
to find the right one
is that
was n't but
there is an association in town of professional home , care providers or something like that here .
where do you live ?
and they have a number you can call
care provider
care provider
she goes to seminars
is that
and they have weekly meetings , and everything
and , so it 's
that 's great .
and , she is great just .
and , she says
are not going to have her anymore
n't count on that
have , but
my son , was eight at the time , barely just eight
, they were very good
that 's why we picked it , because they were supposed to be real great ,
think they were fine , and
but the thing is that he was in school all day , in second grade ,
then there would be a whole ton of other kids , all in the same room , and
with these computer games you know
'd and then
but , it was just like until five thirty going to school instead of being able to get home at two thirty at night .
poor kid was in school all day .
because he was always around with a crowd of kids
being able to be by himself
they need that time , even at that age
we need all that time , some quiet just time to wind down from the day .
exactly is that it .
think that 's really important ,
think of that as just so important , we both
it is .
and , you could hardly wait ,
it is .
now he is so much fun ,
he is starting to get lots of fun really
and ca n't wait until stuff like that
i bet ,
was doing
it was so much fun and
and he rode an elephant
and he got up on all this elephant by himself
and could n't believe it
they have so much fun .
that 's great .
there in line
is going to end up on this elephant with him , and
he did it by himself ,
good for him
so stuff like that are starting to come along where it 's really , getting fun .
care day done just just incredible stuff with him
and with something he comes home
they are working with him
that 's great .
that is so good .
and he goes running ,
he is out of there .
is he always and
so
, is the best care days in town ,
and it is one of those who are very hard to get into .
it was ridiculous .
two days care within
she knows what she is doing ,
that make such a difference .
it makes a huge difference .
that 's the way it is at my daughter 's too nursery school .
really and make a difference
it 's not , because it 's a job they could get because they did n't qualify for anything else a profession
that 's right .
that 's right .
that 's right .
really liked and her
and she worked hard to get good people , really
but was the people she got
and got lucky
all of his teachers and was very good , .
that are sometimes
that 's great .
it is n't sometimes .
it 's real expensive then ?
it just went up the first of this month .
it is
there is little quite a jump there , so
and there were places on was cheaper ,
your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money ,
have and peace of mind , where he is
some of those other places
exactly is that it .
the same thing
but she is gone three mornings .
said to her , but
used to have a problem with that such when
they would n't have anything to do .
have you have a family reunion ever ?
me tell you
this is a really neat thing to do , that they did , too
did n't do it
some of the other people , the older people organized it .
what they did , and they have
and , what they did was then they asked every family to write something about their family .
it went through , and
and then it showed who was my husband 's parents who he married
and it went through the whole family and stuff .
is that
and , it was so good .
it did , but really ,
in it because , you got to participate sort of
everybody did so send in their information
, about it , and they made
and then you could get it at the reunion .
and , everybody got a book , who came to the reunion .
and it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they have
and it just kept coming up through the generations on .
so , that was
is that
so , do you have a big family ?
he does .
he do ?
he does ,
n't
make for me not having any
kind of
have a kind of a big family
and he had just himself and his brother , and his parents ,
and is that it .
us when we started first together going to
met my husband first
said this ca n't be ,
nobody can have many this relatives ,
because a lot of them lived in a group down highway one .
and , there was a lake ,
they down by it there
nice how
so , , and we were going down , the highway ,
and he kept saying , this is where my uncle live
my aunt lives and my uncle
, this guy is putting on me
nobody has many this relatives .
but there really , they were all .
funny how
but you have a choice
and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and too stuff and get a lot of good recipes .
not everybody might like that .
not be able to do it .
from out of town to the reunion
they did .
they came from all over .
you did in other people 's houses put them up
have hotel rooms ,
or , how you did do it ?
they just stayed with different ones of them .
they did .
then , and they have it .
it had got so big they had it at the church .
and , they have a service church ahead of it , ,
on they and then out .
nice how
they just brought and food with them ?
they did have just over a weekend ?
is how that they did it ?
do n't think that 's my family as big as your husband 's
do n't think we 'd need a whole church ,
but the problem is
there is n't
kind of all have to stay in a hotel
there would be one person who lived there that would have a house ,
but they could n't put everybody up .
think so that it would get kind of expensive
what you can do but ?
about the same distance all to come for all of you ?
they have these places where you can rent them
it 's a big place ,
it 's got little rooms of it and stuff that separate off ,
and , it 's not very expensive that way .
,
so everybody could stay together ?
they have a thing convention type .
a house or something
and then it had little rooms off of it where you 'd go and sleep at night time
spend so much more time together , if you were all in your own hotels or something than
every time , and then , you 'd probably have to go or something .
it would run into a lot of money .
that sounds like fun .
what you can do is that you can write different places , the chamber of commerce , tell them .
what they have at area lakes and all
going easier , that way , who try to locate it , because , you can find out so much
can run up a bill you really
you ca n't
everybody and then goes to that place .
and that 's not bad at all .
that does n't cost as much you .
that would be great .
that would be nice really .
that sounds good .
now that we have one ,
lost a lot more of my family ,
did n't have any of them left
but they have thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat .
and everybody went to this restaurant
did n't like that much
who to
have to draw a line ,
or the people who had that reunion did have to draw a line
, wanted to come
to the initial people all the oldest ones
then those in turn got a holding of these other ones .
or five different people , which would call some of them , if they did n't have their addresses and all on them ,
we have to tell them how many people were going to be coming
and you have to check what you would be willing to bring off all .
.
that 's the reason it ended up in a church because there was just so many of them .
they knew ahead of time how many people to expect
just that would
divorce and like that
my parents
do n't know
put down on the list
and you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask .
send back to those other people
kind of control in over
then , they sent their little things to us .
wanted my kids and any of my family to come
.
,
that 's a pretty good idea to do it that way .
really so there was n't a problem that way
that 's a real good idea .
tell you , but what
i bet
course we 've got it still
and charged us they
it 's not a hard book back , and
it has everybody that you could imagine ever and some you could n't .
how
, known
is that
is that
and , it will be something my kids will have .
what you could tell your kids .
do n't know if you 're like me ,
known , but very little about before my grandparents
very little about it
the thing is know a lot of stories ,
but ca n't remember about what it was
growing up and even when
these stories
but have no idea that was in those stories it was that
, could n't tell my kids those people were like
remember that they have some funny stories , just
but do n't know who it was
out some information from your parents
you wear usually
is basically
was in education and in administration ,
wore dresses basically so
because my work often took me into court
but that was just me .
many people in the classroom , and what have you wearing pants very comfortable
old just enough
about how you ?
they do n't really and
you can pretty much , to
's meeting with a customer
training classes
wear a suit or dress , and so when
and is more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or type of thing that when it is
but it really just depends on the weather and my mood
and then when
thinks that do make , and
think to wear dresses and suits and , more classical style of clothing when the tendency there is
are now and then to work
they 're , though .
n't exactly
maybe it 's just because of the sexist views and everything
, do n't know
have seen
and they were n't .
in good taste
would n't want to do that , just
are
some that may be will come like inches four
have seen
it depends upon the size , the shape of the person , as well as the shape of the person 's legs and again .
education retired from i
and at a modeling agency here .
them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers , in my class , even though .
should not necessarily be the greatest fad ,
and then you 're in the situation where you are very unhappy .
like too looking at your legs necessarily .
that 's right .
just to me , and would n't feel comfortable in that at work
have to agree with that ,
even when they were very , very popular in the early sixties ,
we have no regulation against it
a lot of the kids and of course , did
very for the teachers men
do not like to see , in the corporate areas
do n't like that ,
sometimes even with of a suit the very tailored look like
you do n't want to do it over
a little , a touch of it just to say
but can
make of that what you wish you
because that was
started out as a physical teacher education
and that ,
continued just so , of course , and then
'll wear shorts and what have you and be very comfortable
usually do n't wear a lot of blue jeans , but when
have difficulty getting them to fit me
certain norms companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees but .
your boss and does n't come up to you and say remember , tomorrow you have a meeting
so you 'd better wear a suit .
use good judgment and dress
that 's good .
but , other than that , it 's pretty lax
think that 's good because it does allow people to be individual and
feeling that day the way
or if you can ,
think and sometimes
have to meet with a customer later during the day
so , i think , that 's good that they are like that .
about what the employees wear
blue or gray or black and a white shirt and no variation
quite and do n't agree with that
n't either
and they were doing a presentation
you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants .
one was a skirt and
that can stifle creativity .
.
probably long enough
guess so
it 's been nice talking .
talking to you too
enjoyed it
the death penalty for
also in killing someone in the process of rape and
and do n't really remember what else
think about it
think it is justified
very much .
,
think it should be in other cases other than shooting just a policeman
too
, too , .
think they 're doing their duty ,
if they 're going to come out and kill then
killing as a policeman easily just as
that 's right ,
.
.
heard something on the other night the news
a little thing at
a call in survey says
and then you called
for yes , and two for no one and .
was one of the other day the questions , this last paper and that a interesting real question .
, did n't
he is
he is a black men ,
and he just got fed up with it .
his car stolen three times
but he is organizing people ,
and they are going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory .
think that 's what it 's going to take , though
think so
really .
n't think can do it alone
that 's right ,
think you 're right
is going to take together it ,
is
asking so he can go to bed
not getting together and just saying ,
we wo n't allow this in our neighborhood .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
to other neighborhoods from there
that 's right ,
that 's right .
know they try to be careful
and they try to be sure
for twenty years death row on
known
is one thing ,
and that 's
, the case for sure was
by the time it gets there
have and
have and then
they 're sure .
there is no doubt ,
then it should happen ,
there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind ,
there be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty
that 's right .
once , they 've got so and there 's no doubt , do it ,
that sounds cold ,
that 's right .
it is costing us a heck of a lot of money and
look at it that way
it is ,
known
but that 's the way it is .
if the crime .
and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago ,
do n't know if there were anything in your paper about it
, did n't notice it
and there was a lot of protest ,
so the governor backed down
and was so mad
his crime was just horrible .
you do n't reform them ,
n't
and have done it over and over and over
are being under the influence of drugs and no excuse to me .
and do n't know ,
have my doubts
that 's right ,
, too , .
, do n't know
there is
, it gets out of hand , just
or was not it .
and she was telling me about it .
ca n't remember who was the town , some little area
have here lately
what you were about maybe
is that right .
is that
had n't
think there 's been six or seven of them , over the last eight or nine months probably
they do n't kill them
they do n't kill ,
from nine to twelve years old is what they have been
then brought of the car in their front yard
, that is n't it
of the night the
the kid was gone until the kid 's knocking on the door
can you imagine
you have seen those ?
never thought about that even
'll take out maybe it
even about it
that 's terrible .
it is .
we were over at a neighbor 's tonight
and , my little boy 's just a little over two
their little boy , and is five
there 's a big difference , so
and they were in the back yard playing
and we were getting ready to leave
the boys and was gone
the fence back and were open .
.
and she did n't act like it at all , bothered her
this happens all the time .
we walked out , and through the fence
the alleys , come to the back of the house .
looked down of the alley both directions and
saw neither one of them and
my heart , was in my throat and
and he 's five ?
, do n't know
known
their kids run everywhere
and just ca n't do that
just left her in the front yard few minutes
and and , apparently , drove up
and they saw her never again .
this is too scary ,
that 's just too scary .
into the back yard
and we 've got one of those big fences privacy eight foot .
and other the gate , then had just
but it 's
they 'd have to come over the fence ,
they could not open a gate .
feel about him playing
and come out and look real often out the window
and watch ,
do n't blame you
about your kids
you but
safe better than
he could if that to those little girls and fry .
he could fry .
fry , he could
crimes worse than murder
--
and that
and this is one of them .
because these little girls will .
that 's terrible .
the
, so do n't know
it 's really scary
and do n't know what need to be done
it seems like there is no room in jails to put them in jail
is taking a business class law at night
and the guy who teaches it is
and all these bizarre cases he tell us
, they 're going to serve about a quarter
is it
they 'll serve a quarter of it ,
to a hundred
, do n't know
it just do n't seem right .
it does n't ,
it does n't .
they just got out ,
we going to do about it
unless the legislature will do something
do n't know
that 's the thing ,
we 're going to have to adopt a completely different attitude just ,
to death period , period
and do it .
if , and you will be in prison for the rest of your life .
we 're really going to do it .
the prisons full
with some money to build and keep these people in them
think so .
think that it would be worth it
was watching a show about the other night this
what do you think ?
they are sitting there on ten number ,
they are saying absolutely no control gun ,
we do n't want to think even
think that 's a dumb , situation and
be some kind of background check to see
hunt with it or if you 're going
that 's true .
if they can check your driver 's license every time you get
any kind of
that 's true .
any of that kind of stuff
and right now , it seems to me that there is not that much of a check
a check for
if the gun shopping owner do it ,
he go out and do it
is
and then if there 's nothing .
they going to get a gun no matter what
do n't think they are going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there 's a check ,
i hope
that 's true .
that 's the kind of people ,
knife ,
he is going to do what he wants to do .
that 's true .
just think it makes honest people honest more
the people big a deal
and , if you have to have .
makes it
that 's right .
that 's right .
to a policeman
so we talk about this a lot .
imagine his opinion is a little bit towards the one there , on the scale of one to ten
about that
too many people have access too much .
.
.
even the toy little guns or look real .
that 's really got bad
about that on tv
for holding one
if your child 's old enough ,
are when they are ten look like they
that 's the truth .
and if they should n't be and then they have one of those in their hands guns toy
and a cop comes , up
you ca n't blame them .
have got
you ca n't ,
and you ca n't take the chances .
that 's right ,
kids that age
they are making them neon colors .
think that 's a good idea and
and the kids do n't care .
that 's right .
my kid did n't care .
known
pick up a stick
it does n't make any difference to him .
a gun is a gun to them .
they can play with anything and make it a gun .
that is exactly right .
think they ought to do with guns toy that ,
make them very reasonably
that 's right .
that 's a good idea .
and it is the law that you have a gun ,
, to be able to carry a gun
it and .
that 's kind of ,
it
the police and what really surprised me .
think that 's what they were going after ,
they interview this town
they interview them about the gun control laws
the police said all the people said that 's fine and
we could care less .
and everything like , that
all
we do n't but
everybody 's got one
the people in that town and , so , it was quite unusual to see
do n't know
that 's kind of an odd thing .
, do n't know
have a gun
had my folks and have always
to shoot when was real little
, is people need teach their kids , what to do -- and what to do not
was probably five or six years old
but it was
was far and away ,
you do n't ever and
you do n't point at people it , and
that 's what we 're doing .
is that
or you ca n't get a license deer .
is that
and it 's basic stuff ,
and yourself and then
those things and .
that 's real good .
to the number of times those kind of stupid accidents
, common sense things
put the safety on the gun
it is always .
known
and people do n't want to believe that .
it is empty ,
it is empty .
or clip
about the one in the chamber
in the chamber
that is exactly right .
we teach our daughter
he do up all the time too ?
when he 's ,
she 'll know ,
do n't think about it , even
so , she is real good about it .
and never , she is
she can be there if he had them , cleaning them out
it 's not
be
about not
if it 's just one piece of something more ,
have , but
they 'd have that respect for what it does , and what it can do .
and it is up in the closet ,
the shells and then
and it is
got because my husband used to travel and be out , and it
he was out of the country at one time for three months .
living in a nice neighborhood
still , but
still .
the kids not going
and it is in a case ,
and it is
and it is away and all that ,
but do n't want to take
if somebody does break in ever , and it 's going to take
go to a lot of trouble
hold on
hold on
he is somewhere in here ,
he is
know how to use one
once in every hunting going
and he showed me how to use his guns
really enjoy it and
would grab it even
, known
, used to think
it was a lot easier when
it was one thing
and it was when an easy decision .
that 's true .
you 're going to get it ,
now there are so many other things , and
the kids
they doing
where 's this person coming in from ,
, at the same time
we have
if they are stupid enough to come through then .
kind that in the backyard , and too always of
of an extra buffer .
be pretty stupid
that any they can take
and , that is one of them
unfortunately ,
it guess makes it worth the dog food over the years .
really do
, too , on gun control
we 're actually in pretty good agreement on it .
think
it would be interesting even more .
is glad you 're not
me too
it 's been nice talking .
you too
and work garden
have so
have after three years of working at it and
what 'll cut the long way you , one
you 'll go the opposite way , then
and it helps the grass come back .
it really do
did n't know that
you have been working on it for three years ?
for three years .
what have you done ?
lots of fire ants
it was like
can barely hear you
is this better ?
a little bit ,
it was like you 'd go out in the yard to water something ,
you 'd just be standing still .
and the ants would
's standing in a mound , though not
you did
it 's a crystal .
you have a problem with that , since
not bad
a mound up
but that is , been expected .
it did kill anything else it was n't supposed to ?
not really .
it was n't , as far as supposed to .
even the area of the grass was and around .
that 's pretty wild .
we used for fleas it .
we have fleas in our yard real bad last year ,
we did , and that
believe it or not ,
wo n't get out and do it , so
but my husband do most of it , basically
and all that kind of thing
we have winter rye , out back
know what it is out
but this is
you said last year in the yard you have problems with fleas ?
found one thing
, it drives the fleas completely out of the area
what ?
i wonder why it do ?
you do n't have to put out a whole lot ,
and just and
you do n't have to put clumps of it , and
cover the entire yard lightly
'll have to remember that , because we wo n't have them this year , hopefully
but we have a cat who come in and out ,
the cat and was getting fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house ,
last year with fleas , so we have a real problem
because we got them in our house , and it was quite a drag
not , with smoking bombs , which is impossible to do just about ,
but we did ,
so we do n't want them back this year and
if it 's a problem in the yard
, do n't know
for that our
but that is about the extent of our lawn care .
, so do n't know
you do enjoy doing it ?
.
my wife ca n't understand
it 'd be outside a hundred degrees ,
'll be out there
but it 's too hot to be working in the yard .
is under the trees ,
is having fun ,
's and
so what 's the problem ?
that 's funny .
not everybody enjoy , though it .
everybody had a different thing .
i kind of enjoy it
my husband and do n't .
sometimes be too busy to get out there and do it ,
and he does n't really enjoy doing it ,
he 'll do , but
but is kind of like you
and he 's kind of like your wife .
would like to have a garden , but
that 's my thing ,
where we are living we have right now , but
kind of trees
but you ca n't have a garden ,
you ca n't till it ,
or it 'll tear up a nice tiller .
are we so
we do n't have a lot of sun either because it 's big trees back there .
so we 're going to wait ,
, is to get a house where we can have
and so 'd like to do that
'll be out there taking care of that all the time ,
but that is our next thing .
do you have a garden ?
this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at .
sitting on two about a lot acre now
and , is the back half my garden .
that sound .
where do you live all ?
where
assumed you were here
is that
is that
is that
we have n't been able to do that yet , but just
so one day we 'll be able to do it ,
's and
do n't know anything about it , and then
, have to learn
'll and then
in your garden
'll go nothing , and
should do
i guess that is about it , though , but
it sounds
'll
and do you have anything else you wanted to say ?
had an very enjoyable conversation with you
, known
too you
i hope you have a nice days ,
and we 'll talk later to you .
too you
what have you seen ?
knew you were going to say that
want to go see that
finally , ended up just going to see
one day my husband had the kids and
and just because we could get to go because it 's so long together see it never went
finally just went so
and just thought it was fantastic
were hoping that he was going to get best actor
but he did pretty good on that one .
it just blew me away .
i bet
out right now that
are afraid to go see that one
that one looks scary , from the previews just so .
nightmares for the next six months
be good , though ,
what people said
some friends that went see it
said they
that 's about the exorcist what they said .
it is terrible .
you 'll have nightmares .
watched last weekend
me and my roommate .
we laughed about it .
do n't know
was a kid
,
read before the book
the book , to me , and was frightening far more than the movie was
he 's a very good writer
and he had a way of putting you in that scene .
were living alone at the time and of course
called the crisis line
i bet
and there 's
's see
there was
ca n't remember , and
did n't like the previews on that even
known
up at the theater
and did n't
'll try that so
but it was n't worth anything .
did n't care for that at all
did n't think that was any good
saw
hardly ever going
've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one
two thousand and ten was far better .
if thousand two and one was a good movie .
had n't read it
could n't figure what was going on half the time , and
nobody could figure it out .
there is just things ,
all you can do is put it in words .
you ca n't put it in pictures .
a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film , you say
saw the movie too long ago , not just
the book is really good .
and that is one of them .
it 's written so well .
you 're right .
have n't
that 's the most precious movie .
.
it is the story of this little cat and dog
it 's just so realistic .
you wonder how they got to do some of these things ever them in the world .
it was , a real dog and cat and
a real dog and cat ?
all the other animals and
set where they are raised
the cat and then on this treacherous journey gets .
end floating down this river
do n't know where it is in the world
think it was filmed somewhere in china somewhere
but it 's just really an incredible thing .
sort of like the incredible journey sound .
it was pretty wild
but there 's nothing else to keep it going .
but it keeps me really going .
have seen twice now it
anymore
all those that old good ones
that is something for a kid .
that 's pretty good .
'll tell you
's see
have seen lately
is
ca n't
saw just
have you seen the gods must be crazy , two part ?
that 's a riot .
it is ?
the first one was really good .
but the second one , is really too good .
was
did n't care for the first one much
thought it was funny
but , that 's my sense of humor .
'll have to go get that one i guess
it 's hard to find .
got so tired of these sequels
nine number , ten number , fourteen number
.
.
and so
just ca n't believe it
it 's like rocky films .
have n't seen a one
have never seen any of those
ca n't either
do n't even rent them
n't
i figure if
over over again
my husband do that .
he can watch over and over them .
is to see that many times
so he had once one he likes to watch it over and over .
that was a good one .
have n't seen in a long time that one
loved that film
it 's just done well .
ever saw it
it was so good .
i bet
it 's nice .
so , that has really
the whole thing was about the size of a medium house .
it and because it was so short could n't stand
the ceilings was so short .
there are some nice stuff over there to see .
spent four years traveling around
stay so about twenty years
big deal .
some rocks sitting out in
it is boring .
you did see any movies over there ?
and that was a riot to see that .
you know ,
went to the movies one time
and they have a little theater company there
a week go out to about that once
a really nice place
really good amateurs
but that was interesting .
that sounds great .
did n't have time to go to the movies but just
a lot of videos
who want to drive twenty miles to go to the movies and
probably did some of them .
a lot of people did .
but it would have to be a good show .
it 's hard
sometimes just because the reviews you ca n't go by .
all these neat phrases like
that 's what they .
.
it is , if you 're two miles away from water kind of waterfront like property or something
from love canal
view .
waterfront property here at love canal
but
give me a break
do n't go to movies
primarily 's probably going to upset you and
irritates , but the heck out of me
we 're
,
interesting .
the guy , called
thought they were reading my mind when
going out for
and our house is not
and burn through
so are looking for the easy way out
known
is
is easier to find it ,
you talking outside or inside
is not so bad because it 's more fun ,
it can be a real issue .
there is n't so
the problem is that the sun hit it .
is a real problem , so
prepare well it
of your house to save money just the
and they painted it kind of
so it 's
that are quite a range .
there
and is
do n't want it all over the brick and windows
in your house recently
done
of months the last
that is fun .
we have some more than need be done , and
the problem but
had it when we bought it and
but the daughter was a real estate agent
she was and selling it
before she bought her house town in briefly by her
so she told us .
pretty good all the interior walls
had obviously , but
long big strips
had professional painters
some be redone
the wrong kind of
had that or it
it comes off in strips not even little bit .
because we still have some of that trim work to do so
a job it 's going to be
almost because you have to strip the whole thing , in order to do it again .
wish you good luck
thank very much you
thank you .
is in favor of it all ,
a pretty good job taking advantage of the financial dependence most of the countries have not on us
direct even more than we 've been
do n't think we 've been doing too bad
do you think that 's right ?
think , we should ?
that money is just power ,
it 's like his , mother came over
about our intervention , and their government and stuff like that
and he was
the kind of control that is bad ,
their governments corrupt so
they should work their way , ,
they should be able to work their self out of it
in another country 's problems and things
the ones have to do it and things like that
if that influence will affect our country too for one
and for two that it does help .
the people do want our help in those country
we did n't have to
, as long at least , it is their choice
it 's a government that stays in power , which can stay in power ,
it seems , but
out of agreements with certain leaders
aids and stuff government or
think that , has a lot of things to
i
down or not
was they
so do n't know really what 's going to happen
but we 're not intervening in that ,
put it this way ,
thought
and we 're
with that
stand up
this is ridiculous
these kind of conditions in a world who are advancing as fast as it is
, we do n't want anywhere of this
in a way
think a religion has a lot to do with that sometimes
it was around the other way .
a lot of the rules
the ones , do keep the people down
people in sort of line
do n't understand quite that
even understand what
which is now it that way not
actually
did n't understand though they still
stand as much .
do n't think
really never thought , it that way of
are
speak so , for their rights
, do n't know
could be the economic still .
do n't agree with that ,
, do n't agree
a lot more chances
they are
so , what 's the difference ?
thought
think communications does have a lot to do with it in education , maybe
do n't know about education
because the black community is
think it 's communications , so
think it had a lot to do with education maybe
that 's true .
that 's good , in a way .
with something
sort of literacy rate
in our country ?
in our country ,
good education is still really free .
good education , though that is just it .
it 's good education ?
it may be free
but it good education 's
that 's just it and
are we willing to pay for it ,
people and about the taxes and all
, pay for quality education
higher degrees than
so , you 're going to have to expect it .
some of that money out of your pocket
so do n't know
are
is
where
this is quite a long distance .
it 's certainly .
you do have any pets ?
too use
but none right now .
you do n't have
you get
living in an apartment building
and , it 's not just feasible .
'd love to have a dog
what 's she ?
, it acquired and
and this is
and she told me that even .
of weeks a
for .
and she 's been a lot of company .
however is , she getting a little old
things starting to fail
now live
stay while she and all day in the house
and she 's been holding herself pretty well .
a little on the floor
but she is usually pretty good .
for her such a difference
she 's had it for three years now .
possibly four .
really for her such a difference but .
is a disabled person
are unable to
and if that was n't so certainly would have one
that do n't require much attention
typically is not a person cat
have on occasion brought her cat over for me to keep from time to time
this cat and is
and it would
it 's just a great cat ,
my personal preference is a dog .
would want a cat ever
like
would n't just want to own one
they are
you do n't
, do n't know
with my dog can with
or they grant you , with their presence
we are supposed to appreciate them .
do n't know a cat would do that
used to have , a cat that could read better than any human being in my life me
could just walk in the door
and she know whether to come up quietly or just run and knock over me .
walked in the door
it was
know when she is not feeling too good
she is not doing it on purpose
when she was younger , she used to do that to get even with me ,
and some people might not believe
but , .
this cat something and you make sure to can get to its litter box
for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
decided it and the next morning
have got your attention now ?
animals have a way of talking .
tell
'd trade my dog in for the world
ago she got sick on me
and took her to the 's vet because she was n't eating and she was n't able to jump
she lost all her activity
for one day and she stayed there
she had a cell white count low
took his suggestion so
and took the dog to the hospital dog there
and they said they 'd keep her there for three days .
she ended .
it cost over five hundred dollars me .
plus the vet sent me a bill for what he did
then .
of years a
and then she got sick again on me
brought her to a different vet this time and
have given her and everything
and he gave me the last time
was and
and she 's been okay every since .
it 's been now about two years .
that 's great ,
it 's really .
so the second time
what do you want to do ?
of course , you would .
it to what until it 's all over
the cat and got sick .
so she took the cat to the vet
she had the cat there for two days and
then the cat and died .
and so the doctor said
you this bill and
me bury the cat
so , it cost three her hundred dollars ,
and she did n't get back the cat .
so
they pay for all the medical bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
she brought in just because he was n't feeling good and the cat
so that was kind of a surprise
really you kind of wonder what happened .
they claimed they did the best they could have
then the cat and died .
are looking for another cat for them
that will make their days .
think it will
think
only work
anyway for
listen
it 's been a pleasure talking .
the
and you take care .
maybe we 'll talk again sometimes .
is
that 's my buzzer at the door .
'll
thank you .
think a lot of people believe their little one vote is not going to make
they do n't really and
feel like so many of the politicians
and vote
they want to do
they are corrupt anyway .
have a voting in communities party and have the issues there and so
, is not on that one voting
go today
or it wo n't
and think it does
we vote every time
there 's no question
it does make a difference .
people have to vote in different areas
not everyone votes and at the same place .
and do make one vote
maybe and let them have some mock elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young .
that 's a real good idea .
they doing in a number of schools that
enough of them country wide , however , probably not .
at least a whole generation of
how to it to say and what have you .
so it is now to the forefront
people taking some action against it
and what it really means to vote
also and we do n't make them .
do n't know how it is up there
is sure you heard about some of ours
it is
we 're going to have a block party .
everybody is going to get together .
we 're going to discuss the different issues and stuff
and then we 're going to go and vote .
we 're going to go vote
maybe they could give something
a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like if you have , the top neighborhood .
of your block or anything like that the
but it 's really bad here .
it is to me .
people just do n't care anymore
it do n't make any difference
one crook is as good as the one other .
any of them have to say what
every time .
if there is one thing , if there is one issue , is the ballot
to complain about it
so many people
wish that
but they did n't go vote .
that 's right .
if your friend are not going to have a chance .
that 's right .
he needs your vote
just like he needs everybody else 's .
then they have the voting machines
but they should start that a lot earlier .
though it is the same way with everything in education .
it should begin right down in the first grade .
and not to wait until they are in high school
it is them and then .
started on the lower levels
the principles of the country was established so everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and who that vote meant
people do have a negative attitude towards politicians
and , perhaps , it 's
and they are not always the best person for the job
but they have the money to be able to do it .
a lot of problems along that line
a good idea for the young kids like .
this candidate and tell you
this candidate tells you and some things .
the kids in that class , they
one the other people
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them , now you 're not going to get to vote
but you 're going to have to do what that says person
they would probably understand by the time they were in high school ,
they 'd be ready to vote .
that 's right .
think that 's an excellent idea and
they and that would put them to realize they 're going to have to do what someone else say even though they did n't vote for it .
that in
they can
but it 's just a sad situation
they 're making some more intelligent decisions .
think that sounds great
it 's going to take before that 's going to be accomplished
they 'd have to start when they are real young .
that 's right .
it would have to be a child that is just coming .
'll tell you too now another thing
because there was never anyone who showed us how to use the voting machines , never voted in high school
this , sounds dumb
did not know how to use those voting machines , but
nobody ever and showed us or anything
so did n't vote because anybody who went in there and they asked a question , all the other kids laughed at them
they thought that was funny .
do n't
was going to go in there , and vote
did n't know how to work the machines
it is .
that 's bad .
was out of school and
was a married person
and did n't know how to work the machine
do n't know how this machine to work
or said this is the way ,
just the opportunity to try the voting machines ,
it is , this is the way it 's going to be .
and was my son exactly the same way was
and did n't realize until his senior year it
did n't go vote
is getting in that machine
then realized
and we voted the next time
my son come with me in
and she said why
he 'll have to come back out .
him know how to use of these one
any of the buttons down
but want to show him how to use it so that he 'll be able to vote
so he went in
and he is now
good .
he would vote before then , but not .
think that 's bad and
it is sure .
here was
and even , of course there 's a lot of years between the two of us --
you do have any pets ?
have three cats , and a dog
, like
to go ahead .
we just got the dog less than a year ago
what kind is it ?
he is a mixed breed ,
he 's got a blue tongue ?
he 's got little spots on them .
was out , but
just them but to death .
the guinea pig for your child was ?
daughter ,
have the dogs , a guinea pig
so , though she enjoy her anyway ,
so that 's what matters .
they are
and we 've been breeding them .
which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breeding .
because we thought
and he is so far biting ten people .
got the from , he
and they have no longer any other cats .
's telling it
we have
we have the cat , first
and they 'd play just
and they never harmed her .
they got along , so great
do n't know how it would be bringing in cat to a full growing dog
would n't want to bring a cat into a full growing dog ,
they would
i think
how old 's your child ?
five .
five ?
she is a real .
so , you have the dogs before you have the baby ?
a lot of
ours real friendly
they are
but they are
what
the
's black and
bet the black one is pretty
he is a big old thing .
and was
about your baby
with what really helped my daughter since she
and they get
and she love them to death
they and
up , as long as to do n't have they
, too
other people 's houses to
and they have pets ,
they .
the other
hate and that
and they should n't be ,
some maybe
she would n't harm them at all
around their children have pets
think it 's a good idea to have so
we have those
those and
are
a lot than a dog
enjoyable animals to have ,
about getting an aquarium , partly for the cats
think the cats , would really enjoy it
with a lid ,
of course ,
and they are so , expensive to start up .
,
have the fishing saltwater
and they are so , much more beautiful ,
know
most of them that pretty
much care for them
, do n't blame you there
, do n't know
those fishing beautiful just
like you have a little bit of with you or something ocean .
rather than just little fishing
and it finally died
and that was
she ca n't play with it ,
just can you look at it .
and my cats would then knock over it .
have to be real careful
if the cats will jump on things up , and knock things over all the time ,
they 're always where they are not supposed to be up .
and that is hard .
that 's just like kids ,
they are not
they are not
that 's right
and they are so , independent .
i love having them for that reason
it was real weekend to go easy to town for three days
now it 's like you and while to take care of the dog .
that 's right ,
that is hard .
we knew it ,
we never thought , but even when we got the dog
we saw him , just
he is
take him home
the first weekend then we have him we were in a two apartment bedroom , and
fun .
had work hours twelve that day , and
left and so
all over the floor paper and .
opened the door
and there were chunks of carpet , everything , all over the place padding
dig his way out
did n't you get your deposit back
have
did n't even tell the apartment manager , which got it
so , to me , , this was a whole new experience .
it is .
it was n't only like cats at all .
it was
they were in that instinct
but n't
and we found , she is right at a year
and we finally got
her only problem is trash .
and put it on a table or chair or something
do n't care how full she is ,
so , it 's not like she
it 's just she wants to get into trouble .
away through anything that are if any kind of meat or anything
they think , is good anything
they 'll get into the trash ,
and then it does n't
how tight and you have the lid down on it ,
they 'll get into it .
came from work to find a days home many
.
is the cat and
left it there
could n't help myself
when she do that ,
and she knows that it is wrong ,
you 'll walk in the door
under the table
so , she knows she does wrong .
but she continue to do it ,
is still but
he is ?
who 's your favorite football team ?
guess .
you ca n't
you got it .
and want to tell you something
what is that ?
they 're going to go somewhere pretty shortly .
because they are getting better every year
do n't think so
we went to the playoffs .
them , too
so , it 's good to see
.
they doing better a whole bunch
who 's , their quarterback ?
what is that ?
who 's their quarterback ?
like to watch them , too
like to watch the almost all football
but of course , i watching can
think they are really going to do good because it seems like they 're finally all together coming , but
now , they have been able to get some good players and come around
and then they were n't getting the draft
look at the cowboys
they are hurting .
really bad
but they got so much bad publicity , too .
play on their team
does n't give you much respect for their team at all
of bad seasons a
ca n't even those bad seasons to bad coaching and
off the team because of drugs , because of messing with young children
and it was right after just one thing , with them .
and had a lot of trouble with injuries , too .
his guys healthy
you 're right .
was people
and do n't know ,
that sounds to me more like the front office than problem coaching problem ,
but the team then were sold .
he bought the team , and it just all seemed like he just decided this is the way
and it was bad .
it was really .
is going to take it
felt about it
tell you , but what
there are n't nobody going to beat us then .
because look good how we did without a quarterback this year .
known
who was the quarterback ?
if they had quite a few quarterbacks , .
ca n't remember that guy 's name , the one who held out for the money and then
and he was across the river .
ca n't think of his name now ,
but we did n't really have a quarterback .
that was the whole problem , .
could n't
and we have guy who could n't run one .
we did n't really have a quarterback .
it was defense won all the games .
they able to draft anybody this year was ?
do n't know
so do n't know
whether they have a new one or not
.
do n't know whether they have one of the first choices of somebody , but
that would be real good .
everybody gets in draft .
but do n't know whether they 'll be far enough up where they can do any good
or even making the playoffs
so that does n't help you in the draft .
and we just do n't really have a quarterback truly ,
that 's all there is to it .
the players and stuff , they quit giving the really good players away
that was a few years ago .
he was good .
'd every time , but
had a different coach and of course , too
'd but
then he 'd and leave .
and it was weird .
do n't have you on our team
but they have good all players except for the quarterback this year .
ca n't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks ,
but all of them were bad .
they were terrible .
they could not
it was terrible , .
was unbelievable , but
it 's one thing ,
you did get watch any of their games ?
are pretty sure he was this past season
as problems they have
and now they 're playing really good together as a team .
when
is a musician
just something on
in so many places
teams in your area
i games of first want to see .
known
the bills
this year , when a bills was fun
is that
and it was good weather .
ice and rain , and everything
tell you , but what
you watch some of these
do n't know how it will be this year ,
these games but right down to the wire .
was on the edge of my chair sitting
ca n't remember
when we were going to find out if we were going to get to be in the playoffs or not
so , we 're watching the game .
the team other got the ball
we got back and the ball .
that 's the way it was .
had a game and
have so
and they started showing us another football game
we did not get see .
talking about people .
it was wild .
everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair here ,
and they then changed the game .
of another one who was going on the
cut the last few seconds
it was the network .
because it was funny .
everybody was
was up so
could n't believe that
come down right to
we would be ahead ,
them get up with them or right ahead of them either there
come down right to
either and we made
or we did n't .
and it was something else .
we would have went to the super bowl if we had a quarterback this year .
there 's no question about it , because everybody was playing good except the quarterbacks together .
and the quarterbacks just did n't do anything .
that 's the guy who counts .
but , maybe we 'll get your guy .
all set
do you want to start ?
, can go ahead and start
to go ahead .
in the larger cities
it is kind of a concern for me ,
at the moment is in fact
is
now live on a third floor
do n't want to be on a first floor where you can have ,
do they have many buildings that have security there ?
some buildings
it depends on the location .
as far as crime rate is real good
and we do n't have ,
or access electronic gates and things like that
is a little familiar with the city area , forest lane and through that , off the freeway , and
live here out in
and they 're going to the big cities .
makes it
it really do ,
and have seen the same thing that you are talking about crime much more than ever before
and do n't know ,
a lot of younger people into more violent crimes
that 's really sad ,
fourteen or twelve years old
no remorse , and what ever .
it 's really sad .
it is
.
people getting too easy off
the prisons do n't have enough room
so they get ,
they do n't , some of those people and
last night in on the news fact that we were watching this man who lost his daughter ten year old
he ran out to the store for a few minutes
he left alone her home
old
she 's old enough to be alone for a few minutes .
and and while he was gone , stopped at the store
that 's what it was .
the neighborhood clean carpets , these two men
and the other one was in for life imprisonment .
and he is out .
that 's terrible .
that they are in the same circumstances
the reasons that they 're doing it compared to the reason someone else 's in jail for it it 's two different things .
some crazy things
, do n't know
it 's a little more understandable under the circumstances , i guess .
guilty of the crime
once they 've been arrested
and if they known beyond a shadow of a doubt
that 's it ,
, do n't take we
, do n't support we
,
right back where they came from
we have enough problems with in as it is the jails overcrowding .
so take care of it
but they are so close , ,
in where we came from two hundred years back
that
you know .
it was amazing
let the guy and say
for a few minutes and she thought
she said , and no .
he said , and yourself there is any place you would n't go by .
she said , no .
and it 's safe so there said they can you leave your purse on the subway
will and somebody
nothing and will be missing .
they said they can just about guarantee that there , that , that would happen if you did that .
believe you better ,
you would n't even have to leave it ,
that 's true ,
right off your arm
that 's true .
could n't believe that she could n't think of any place
that 's amazing ,
what 's the difference , there
you do know ?
is not sure what it is there
they really enforce , and
in the death penalty
really .
for that the death penalty
they are very , very tough , just ,
they are just very tough on criminals .
think we 're too easy
we take the , civil liberties stuff and too far .
in prison we did
they put themselves in that situation .
,
,
we take care of them
they no sooner and get out on the street
and they are in back again .
is not saying they are all bad ,
for for the rest of their lives
think
of them
is that
far with all of this
same with drunk drivers
think it 's too easy for them
you have to set an example .
you have to start somewhere .
and , they might serve a little bit of time , and they 'll be out on the street again .
and let
they get what
much .
dollars a year , if they are twenty thousand .
would n't do it for that
and in some of these big cities , not especially
in the line of duty
that 's really sad and .
it is ,
it 's really .
and they are the first ones who take the brunt of everything .
is not and
but they have three strikes against them when they 're out there
and because they 'll arrest someone and go through that all paperwork writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence
you 've and
you thinking about buying next
, currently have
what year ?
and is ready to get rid of it
actually ,
it 's not pretty old .
it got , and
had a lot of problems with this one
you think their quality control are going down over there , kind of
it is kind of funny ,
a lot
it is true ,
but that is one reason
there 's no question
that 's true .
is they still and
that 's true .
and it 's amazing just
and they 're not making them like that now , ,
at all .
what it was
it was just a wonderful car
and then it got
would n't look at another car , and even
did n't look around or anything
this is
had a lot of problems with it
but do n't know
'll probably hold on to it since it 's still under warranty
of about a month once the shop an
it was in the shop about the first twelve twelve times months .
that 's a lot .
it was ,
anyway ,
so , is what your next purchase supposed to be ?
, known
if you have a choice of your car , what would you get ?
this is going to sound , really strange ,
really like those
have kids , and
's real familiar with the body style on that
, do n't like those styles
n't know
an old type
who how to explain it ,
what
something like ,
do you have a family ?
have a couple kids
probably maybe a little bit
have air conditioning
have those things
otherwise do n't care
it was right out of college when
and always be
and ended up
and they are pretty fun to drive ,
is going to have to get next time around ,
keep holding off
and then could
it 's just such a huge expense
and are going to keep holding off just
car .
'd like to have a sports car too ,
but it 's not practical for me ,
you still there
there are some kind of problems .
you still there
is something wrong .
wonder what happened .
, do n't know
, it does n't it
just
is that
'll get myself to spend that kind of money ,
at least ,
, known
new cars cheap anyway
maybe .
we all have those kind of dreams too
you there ?
this is strange .
think is something wrong with this
it is
you there ?
it may be my phone ,
only the car
you 're right .
fun and .
those nice
they are cute cars .
they 're going to make only three or four thousand .
so , he went out
and he got this one ,
have n't seen those
have n't seen either one yet , but
supposedly but they have
so , it 's
is supposed to be limited edition and only
no matter if it 's a limited edition , it is worth usually something later on
hope that it 's not going , bad ,
is it
so do n't know
have never
that be a lot more than for something is limited edition that
, do n't know
think the demand is gone all , down a little bit
the prices as high
and they were n't ?
that 's true .
and they may have gone down a little bit
they are still pretty much in demand .
think there is another car coming in ,
and ca n't
would think somebody would try to compete with that , because it 's very popular ,
it 's really .
that 's the same manufacturer
those nice
just so , .
but
those supposed to be very power performance
big time .
the expensive ones ,
those but
and there 's nothing ,
that one , is just for looks more
it does n't have really the performance that the expensive one does .
, but have seen
it is not quite as nice for a little bit less .
they 're not really bad that
, but do n't know
said it still is practical for me not
looking at cars like that
is being single
and for yourself , no other responsibilities
, have been pretty happy
, have n't tried to upgrade myself right now ,
get something nice
right now , but is consulting
my first job hop about eight months ago
quite a few state parks
camp can you and is at
most of them have pretty good facilities .
part of them
so , probably that 's a pretty nice place to go .
they 've got real nice system , lake around their parks .
it 's nice real there ,
bunch of
what about you ,
camp for a long time , and did n't
maybe home and then camp .
that was pretty good and
still in it and once .
off and on over the years
we did
it 's pretty much in the eastern half of it
an area
they are about three hours away if .
and you can
but then you are talking about six to eight hours .
the way it works .
but it 's a real nice place to go and camp ,
they do n't spend money as much as a lot of other states might just probably .
we have been a lot down the parkway ,
there is
ca n't say
that seems , like a challenge .
it is actually kind of incredible ,
it 's really , really nice .
have ever done
the sky is just so amazing .
you can really count thousands of stars , probably
just kind of
a lot of people do n't realize beauty
desert
course , all of those qualities
find else except in a desert
so , it 's pretty nice .
the movie , the doors , has some nice desert scenes
a lot of drugs with them
the shots pretty nice
and it 's sort of like that ,
it is almost surreal , just in some places .
it is
the temperatures real extreme there
they can be ,
you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what 's going to happen .
it 's just beautiful .
but it 's quite bearable
it 's just great .
it 's really very nice .
is going to get a chance to do that
that would be pretty nice .
is that
a lot of people like
was walking , especially with my gear
'll
that one thing you said about the stars are really true
so it 's
amazing , just how
it ,
it ,
otherwise it is
as much as
think we fulfilled our obligation
thanks for calling ,
to you .
you familiar with
come on ,
would n't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball after that , if you asked me
we about later to can think
heard yesterday in regard that he did n't design the missile patriot system , a joke on the radio
the radio 's kind of cruel , and
humiliating for a man to do that , any man how
do n't care if you 're president
at the same time , but do n't know
it 's pretty far to throw that far .
could n't do it
known
but he is a man
come on ,
men know how to do that ?
be able to do that
known
kind of
that must have been hard on him because he is just a person
a major owner of the team here
did n't know that
he was the owner
but it turns out my mom said he is part owner
but he must own the biggest chunk
because he 's on the news a lot , even know his name
never have not like some people hour and a half a day or anything to watch the news and
my husband 's
it 's incentive ,
saw that
, where the guy asked him for proof of what he was
known
a credit card .
known
he said and
it does so fast ,
heard on the radio it
heard the on the radio in the car audio portion
but did n't see
it was
it was a really cute too little kid .
that 's about my extent about baseball ,
do n't know , that much about it
because my brother , was supposed to go to the opening game
could n't tell you that pitched , and
but they won ,
they did ?
, my a lot
and then somebody else , lost
that is so stupid all you have two teams .
that 's really stupid .
then they can
known
thought they were moving
this is
we did go to a game baseball last year .
that too
was
he did n't want them ,
so they gave them to us ,
with baseball tickets
and we ended up with them .
and so we were , walking up
.
looked at my husband and
really good seats
ended up on the floor there and so on
they call at five
and the game started at seven
, ran over and got the tickets and walked
and so we took with us two kids
because they are fancy seats and stuff .
you just sit down and
all the girls and all
, was just there
is
is here ,
we got , but
if they did hit would
is always
going
but last year we went
he does leagues football and leagues baseball and all kinds of stuff ,
if there 's a game on , and he is watching it .
is that all there
is glad my husband 's not like that
is glad my husband 's not like that , either
'd kill him
my brother 's like that
he goes to a lot of games , and
not a real lot
but he tries to go ,
my father , then got us some tickets
my brother 's wife
there and , as he describes it in a crowd
it was nice weather and stuff ,
it was n't a real problem ,
in a crowd you but there
and you 're waiting and waiting and waiting
the hot dogs
him try a hot dog
that 's funny .
so there
really wait for the longest time
all of a sudden something happens and then
you look the other way during the time
the whole thing
wait basically and and so
when it happened missed it and did n't understand he and
that 's funny .
, eastern part
he 's not that far ,
and she 's off on lived there
she is still there ?
and it sit right at the limit ,
is that
she
and they have twelve children .
twelve children ?
she has twelve children .
the poor woman
she looks gorgeous ,
she 's gorgeous
just like having kids
and she is thin
four or more children and
probably you ca n't afford to eat , if you have more than two of them .
have a friend that have seven
and they are
they are all real young ,
they are raised just right
but they are not condemning you ,
we have only one child ,
or anything 's good because it would be easy for them to do that ,
a conviction like that
and you think everyone should have it .
they do n't do that at all
go in their bathroom
there are and brushes ten tooth in there .
always and give her a hard time
have the kids , even
we are expecting our first baby , almost any day
for one thing
in your money bag a
think that helped a lot
that last year 's
he just work a normal job .
it was the biggest thing that any one in this company , had ever done
and he got to do it
and we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that ,
just as much of a blessing inside these material things
but it 's a different kind
are a lot people times and thought
have an old car
but you 've got five kids ,
a lot of wisdom in it
training , but at
and is different than anything else
do n't psychology address it .
the good stuff that 's in psychology it just comes out of the bible
but that they have proved to work , they come out of the bible just the years
it really just so this book and
how to train so they 're going to be a blessing them
so they and
and they just live lean pretty much
it 's pretty nice
everything is pretty expensive and
and you ca n't do that just
and you do n't go to baseball games as much
pictures like we did or .
you know
these things fun in other kinds of ways
because you 're probably living in an apartment but it 's kind of a different situation
that makes a really big difference .
but is still as having just as hard
but your cousin could have a team with twelve kids baseball .
they are not all boys
we do n't right now and
have n't just got to doing it around and
keep saying we need have
,
but everybody want to do it
, and had n't just got to doing it around
so they could have really only four members on the team .
think they have only four boys
do n't think they have enough to play yet but two old even
but then you did n't believe me about her kids
they so good
she does work , but
and it 's a commitment
and , is that
can really
, known
too
most of my friends have three or four kids
some of the people in our church and use birth control
have
ten between the ages of two
kept a few summers ago every day for the entire summer two children
and they became like my children .
'd think so
living in an apartment complex and
and we played on the playground a lot
and there was an activity always ,
and do n't know
it seems like always there was something to do just .
children so full of energy
just you going and .
or two parent family
one
one
how much time did she spend with them ?
much at all .
the children were n't usually awake by then .
and she would get home at five thirty in the afternoon .
and they would have dinner
it was time for them to go to bed and then .
now the children at this particular time was two and six .
he is now nine
have and
and he is like a little brother to me .
it 's changed over the years , and
now that he is older we get better .
different things
we used to play ball a lot
and he is
we go see a movie and things like that
want to be able to spend a lot of time
to school
are
communications .
i love children .
, do n't know
my mom stayed when until at home with me and my brother .
think it was very beneficial to us
we always was in the summer
she was just always there for us , and
work , but if nowadays as hard just as the father
and the children get
in a day care
just do n't want to have to be raised like that my children and
my friends , their parents all worked all the time ,
they got to stay at home by themselves
, but they could because their mom would never know it
got , because of lack of supervision
you say you 're in communications ,
what you would be interested in getting in most to ?
major in public relations
public relations ,
or what have you , rather than radio or television or newspapers .
and then you 'd be willing to give up your job to stay home or stay with the children ?
would like to stay at home with my children for the first at least five years
my masters and work on
'll and then in that case
and then would
that 's an advantage of being in the field education .
what grade ?
then went to high school
you did ?
you did
physical education
sure did
from that standpoint out
he had to get on the bus , our son , and then
he did get on the bus , and
it was his responsibility
absolutely .
was in physical then education
just kept getting pushed into administration , and
in administration , up
if he ever skipped school , which was not the case , of course ,
and would n't
and that from the standpoint of parents not working
do n't know what this child want
are working two jobs ,
they have their own television , each
they have their own telephone , each
they have their own rooms , each
they have this , each
they have that each .
they do n't have
that 's right .
they need some attention .
absolutely .
because that 's the way of getting attention .
without a lot whenever my mom stayed home with us , we did ,
it 's hard to make on one income ,
that 's right .
but we did
we have only one car , and
we have only one telephone ,
we did n't get eat out all the time
the value of the dollar
were growing up ,
can provide that for my too child and
and we need more of that ,
parents more
we have such a breakdown in the family structure , from the standpoint of , church and school and everything along the way
we have .
works , and the poor results school
was the very best teachers should be in one grades , two and three
it 's too late then ,
that trend at
it is .
it 's too late way ,
.
involved with the school activities when the child 's in the elementary school
valuable , just as at that time , as
it starts in high school
really need to be there for the child and
needs the child and
we were in view of the fact that my son did play football fortunate
did and keep statistics for his team ,
movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team
and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel we have to be there all the time .
learned a great deal from my students with regard to what their biggest complaints was with parents
your age this or that
that were good that you were hearing it from other students
with their problems
could and talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect
and our son would share this
he and then think he benefited from my experiences .
he work for a different company .
and we did n't even know it .
he did n't even tell us .
he had a bank account dollar thousand five
he could go , and if he wanted to go to college ever
he was
being ten , no , kind of legislation and zero on a scale of one to ten probably would
feel like just what a total ban on guns are going to put the guns in the hands .
and they have a total ban on guns
in n't stop
that or were on rifles ?
think and also
and that did n't help at all ?
the crime is not any better or any worse ,
do n't know if it were any worse ,
but it certainly did n't get any better .
guns by
character along that nature and the seven days holding period and things
you should n't be able to go out there and just to buy .
with that
the law on who can buy
think so that kind of control , would be good and
the statement and , just kind of it to times you make
the guns were only in the hands of the criminals ,
because the person who is being robbed had a gun
maybe they do n't just and report those
or are not sure
good thing they have their gun on them but
and they thwarted the robbery attempt .
is not really sure ,
personally do n't own a gun ,
, would like to know how to handle one
how to handle one
you never know just when you might come .
how about that
so we ended with these guns , up
and my only experience with a gun were shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right really
hit in the thumb me
really only the experience and so was with guns have
kind and .
would feel better if
see someone
you 've anytime of course in this world
that 's true .
do n't know if that 's a large percentage of crime or not
it would be some
think that 's a good idea and
would support that definitely
kind of
with the gun in the back of their trucks racks the cowboys but
that 's crazy .
carry guns in their vehicles
for in the window back
kind of
kind of
is that
thanks for talking
you are welcome .
so do you have a personal computer ?
we do
it been used tremendously , mostly by my children for playing games
for reports and papers and that sort of thing
, is a processor word
got out of college ,
and that was six years ago ,
bought it
my father and had a small business
and use it in the business
he did , and never
he did always everything out by hand .
he had only three employees ,
so it was n't really worth it to him to do it .
he do by hand
like pay , the payroll
lots of them on the market , and .
basically .
but you do have to research that , to find out .
what kind do you 've ?
think it 's a hundred professional three ,
that 's the digital one .
that 's a nice computer .
she moved
my father , and were n't using it
so she took it with her .
do n't blame her .
so do n't know if she is going to use it even anymore
her try other things
i work in a school system
teach and
they written , as you found out yourself , probably
is sponsoring a literary magazine , but also
doing our entire layout on the computer because of the program graphics , and a page maker program that we have
is that
that is , a very good use .
so , it 's
so much with
be a lot of uses
but it 's just .
you have to make to do it yourself ,
you 've but
no for it at all
i working for digital equipment
we have a powerful computer and down at work .
so , you do n't need a personal one
and still do n't really do that much
they are great for playing games .
my son , is studying electronic technology
because he can lay out that way things
it 's really useful , if you 're doing that sort of thing
it is kind of a waste
that 's fascinating , .
the c
knew what you meant ,
and that 's
this is one step above it , but
but it 's
you can do wonderful design .
you have to be so precise .
the computer and all for you do it .
so it was
wanted to go to that course ,
my boss , but would n't pay for it
'll get some day a job
and my boss , will pay for it
be
did n't want to go do it myself
was going to use it really
got this cough ,
it was bad .
what a change ?
it was a big change .
you could n't really wear because it was so hot , a coat
picked up again and then
doing all right
that 's good .
how much personal computers cost
tremendously
significantly came in prices down
have seen for five and six hundred dollars ,
you ca n't do very much on them .
you have to be able to get in your program ,
many of the programs so big
they take up so much space that you do n't have any place then to work .
if , you 're going to have to go over a thousand dollars , but
it 's probably smart to spend that much , and even for a personal computer
ours is not quite that powerful ,
some things we ca n't do ,
have n't , but then
but we have been able to do what we can .
, have n't even begun to reach the limits
junior
and it is not quite as useful , not quite as powerful
they did ,
that 's very true ,
that 's very true ,
they did .
very competitive
do n't even
it 's going to be a waste ,
she is not going to use it .
that you were right .
, like she
she gets to write her reports ,
and done what she wanted
also bought a typewriter
a typewriter with memory , would have been fine
it 's all she use for it .
a editor on it
is not sure
if it does n't she could easily put on it .
that 's the great one thing about it .
you did
you did
it was six years ago .
pretty much set up
you make your filing ,
and then you can edit it .
, used the one at work a lot
of resumes
, and was great just
put it in just
and do n't even have to look up anymore my words
they are great ,
you 're right .
our time
need go help my daughter
this been fun talking to you
good .
luck .
really do n't have a problem with capital punishment
know that they have capital punishment for certain crimes ,
and that 's
seems to be a lot of controversy about that
agree with you
similar views on it
is so much of the controversy
in capital punishment
that 's true .
as far as the controversy goes there 's probably two or three different types of views
kind of
he 's not going to get any better ,
it 's just not going to get any better .
the opinion , do n't have capital punishment ,
but give them in jail life
think that 's what aggravates a lot of people , is somebody
but the problem is not so much with the prison system ,
they are trying to cope with them ,
the thing about capital punishment
a lot of people do n't think it would be a deterrent to future crime ,
and the way it is now , it 's not .
that is certainly no kind of deterrent , and
it 's not , because it 's not a deterrent
it 's not .
the death penalty after
a lot of or maybe
they may spend years ,
keep these guys waiting
it 's amazing .
there is a girl i work with , our secretary , as a matter of fact ,
the guy , he and that 's been on death row for eight years
, but still for
sitting on death row for eight years after
and still ca n't
to carry it out .
it sort of take the justice out of the justice system .
it does ,
it really do .
she and they have to go back ,
so often just another letter and ever .
it should be over and done with .
on with her life getting part that behind her
yet , but it 's kind of tied to her the way it is now .
it is .
a victim ,
also by that , indirect involvement
it 's ridiculous .
she is an emotional victim .
it is terrible
be a cop for that very reason
gets right back out
so many of the crimes by repeat offenders done
.
that 's about five minutes ,
it 's a pleasure talking .
we 'll see later you .
what ,
to go ahead and tell me about your home .
my home at the moment is an apartment .
is
that is interesting .
let 's see , and
we compare homes
correct ?
my home is typical for the area .
living in a development
is
is that
but it 's upper middle class kind of an environment .
two a story
is that
that 's large .
it 's so forth relatively typical for the area
probably for the area
are
larger and
it 's probably ten years old .
that 's not too bad ,
that is still fairly new .
compared to other parts of the country there is
who worth down there is it
in the market really
right now it 's a lot lower because of all the layoffs and everything
the economy around here is real poor .
thought that was on the upswing again now
not really .
there 's been tremendous amounts of , layoffs
so , housing is really real bad .
the economy itself around here is not terribly too bad ,
but housing is still real bad .
now it 's really a buyer 's market there .
been a lot of speculative building
, do n't know
a new carrier was coming in and the attendant vessels support .
that 's no longer , the case .
it is .
single family units on
overbuilding and so been a real problem there
you can get a good for a very , very reasonable price house still so .
two and a half baths , on a half acre or so of land three
upon the neighborhood
what about your home ?
but it 's a home .
it 's a home bedroom four .
it 's on one floor .
we have no basement .
, do n't know
nor do we ,
was n't sure
most of the ones north and everything up
but it also is pretty typical for the area anyway .
most of this area
it is almost twenty years old ,
most of the houses around and here .
over two blocks
otherwise is pretty much , but the layout
most of them
like there were two or three styles probably you could choose from .
and , that 's pretty much in the area , for a square mile probably least , maybe even at a little bit more than that all the houses
west
they designed it and everything ,
and they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand when they left the area .
that 's not unusual ,
are there for example
was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium and
it was very done nicely .
a lot of money
ca n't envision spending , that much money on something along those lines
maybe a little bit higher than that now ,
here that same house , but you 'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year , taxes on it
that much of a difference ?
it 's really sad .
the highly most areas in the country
is
you do know ?
they do have such things as good extremely school systems , for example .
it has one of the best in the country school systems .
public employees make great salaries around here .
this is the figure ,
they did not define it ,
what kind of a car do you drive now ?
do you ?
mine a year ago
is not so buying a car any time soon
either
just bought mine ,
a year in
though .
found my car
all the controls
they are in good spots
and have
ca n't
have
an it is real reliable supposedly
had n't
what did you have before you bought that .
you did ?
ever in my life
it was nine years old
it was still going strong , and .
that the only major problem
replaced the tires
but it was also
the clutch and went
had it five years
and it seemed to go out really easily the last two years .
think it went out twice in two years
that 's a lot and
it should n't go out that much .
is going to do that again
going back
i kind of
have but never
so do n't drive one a lot
do n't feel comfortable in traffic with it
it to sell easier to be a lot
it is .
and resale value is really important to me .
that 's true .
it 's too
at all .
it looked , but still
was still really nice ,
there was n't cracks all over the board and stuff dash .
and it had some nice features .
may never sell it , of course
may drive it until it is dead
foreign cars a lot
, were looking for a car door four having driven the r x seven so long
and it was so small
it 's really impractical and .
and something out easy to get in
and those was really nice
can get them for a great prices and
was going through
were n't even
she was going to sell because she did n't need it anymore and her car
and it was only a year old
and never have driven a prelude
went to a dealership so
and went
i test and drove it
think they are nice
bought and
have them
little all those things
but they are
a used car
this car and bought
that was
i
go for the big stuff .
.
mine was not
really needed a new car
it was getting worn out from being a sports car .
drove it kind of hard ,
got it right after high school and
so by the time , it traded in it was ready .
ready to go
you did ?
this was n't really an impulse
quickly were buying it right then and right
'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years , but
and was
with me the
a used for a new car for yourself car
a used car
was going to buy one
about who is driven them and what they have been through and the warranties and things like that
just ca n't seem to get over that
do n't
you can request whatever maintenance records and
by mechanics and stuff
that 's true .
they ca n't stop you from doing it .
that 's true .
is that all
talking to you
talking to you
we 're on
hang on
usually do you ?
hang on
me check on it
do n't know
more
think we 're on , maybe
we 'll find out
was n't really from here
like the city
but do n't know
is
unfortunately , of course , and the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years .
, do n't know
they are still behind them
but it 's not like it used to be .
the winners
and you do n't back when they 're doing well not them .
that 's right .
and they tried to draft the best athletes
or find their natural niche
about four or five years ago , and then they started going after specific players or positions ,
are saying what you really need
'd so
when they drafted somebody , and he did n't work out at that spot and it was n't a good athlete enough to move to any else place
think it was kind interesting ever so
think the decline of the cowboys as a powerhouse kind of started with drafting the best athletes not really
it makes sense because you 've got the flexibility
if they are good athlete they can do a bunch of different things .
that 's my main sport baseball
have been enjoying football , but
but do n't know it as well
Cowboys going to have a problem
or what was the whole deal on that ?
they still have some draft picks that they got ,
, they have anything high
that 's right ,
that 's right .
it went the other way .
what was
my brain really are working tonight well .
is that
've got a friend who live right next to the cowboys ' training camp
he sees them and running a lot out
and got a chance to talk
and they are all thinking that they really got something going this year ,
of the year everybody 's got great hopes the
it , is the same way with baseball or anybody
start actually going out and getting out against the competition probably everything looks pretty good
, we 're going to be in the world series , even though there is not a prayer
this is the way it is .
they finished pretty close to five hundred did n't they last year ?
as a matter of fact
only because they won the year before game one ?
because it was against the skins
you do n't like the skins
a whole lot and at all
they got a big thing because of the expansion in baseball going on .
are talking about how they 're going to get a team baseball and everything
going to get a team baseball
is
it 's not going to happen .
like a whole lot c never
of course ,
the first thing is the phone call from the league saying he was coach of the year
can you believe that
used to travel out a lot that way
a new stadium
it 's opening next year .
forgot the name of it
the inner harbor
of west blocks a
an old railroad yard
then there is an old station and
the inner harbor , which is really stupid because of the big selling points of the new stadium one is supposed to be this view of the inner harbor
but they are building the baseball stadium
you know
sitting here and talking
and was not real happy when they left to go there of all places
that 's true .
take it you 're an east coast type guy ?
kind of
what do you think about it ?
do n't have any problem with
n't either
do n't think it 's going to change very much
developing as a result
in fact , it was really to begin with .
enough people going to be slaughtered over the internal problems over there
that 's right ,
that 's right .
them one way
thought and
this is the exactly right course .
it has nothing to do with us .
that 's right .
go all the time on all over the world .
all the time
and it 's been going on for hundreds of years over there certainly .
and it 's going to continue .
that 's right .
it 's going to happen all the time , as long as .
that is absolutely right .
and this is just another time that it 's happening .
that is absolutely right .
out in the mountains
of years a
it 's a very opportune moment for them to try .
through some channels back that that
is not real sure that we promised them anything but
that would have been stupid ,
and do n't think we did it
seemed to be right perfectly
do n't think they would have done that
.
but it does n't make any difference really .
this is just another chapter in middle eastern history .
many of them and .
there is no doubt about it .
occupied it ,
we 've done it .
so many times
this is
do n't really have , politics or human rights or anything like that in many of the conflicts and so
it is
that 's right ,
it is
and it is right .
going on and then
it 's a mess .
there is no doubt about it ,
that 's right .
their politics are n't really politics .
as politics
and there 's a big difference .
there
think the way and
because and that 's a big mistake .
bet .
bet .
because there is a complete different set of values .
there are different value placed on human life possessions and everything else .
what is right and is wrong
what is wrong and is right in some cases .
that 's a lot of the time it .
was stationed in turkey for a year and a half
and it was tough , understanding those folks .
it was very strange .
believe
it was very interesting .
can believe that
do n't claim
as middle eastern experts
that is probably true ,
that is probably true .
their books
sure that is appropriate
a little bit of study background
experts by
that 's right .
that 's right ,
that 's an everyday occurrence .
it 's like our industry car ,
.
it 's an overall problem in this country understanding foreign cultures or even accepting them .
but it 's going to get even worse later .
math and the science and everything
that 's right .
it 's not us .
that 's right .
and underwater psychology or some ridiculous stuff like that
and where the engineers are coming from ?
they are coming ,
a lot of them going back there
it is
it is human factors .
was his degree
.
because the education is so much better for those who will go after it was the only reason he come here and
but all too often .
we 've got loads of foreign students
and they are coming here , after the hard degrees going
and they are applying it there .
that 's right .
and do n't know ,
it 's amazing to me .
do n't know what we 're going to do as a country
we 're going to become dependent on other these folks sooner or later .
the country 's got a problem with quarterly reports and statements and things like that annual .
just kind of and .
do n't
here 's a crisis .
plug it up
do n't know
do n't know what the answer is
it is far beyond me .
that 's for sure .
that 's the way things have gotten .
all we can do is
i wonder ,
do n't know if they 're going to have a whole lot of takers at a price tag of six thousand bucks
but is
it 's slow ,
got it through an educational plan purchase through the school
would n't pay that kind of money for their name
that 's right .
that is absolutely right ,
you watch
is already
it is obsolete ,
every day at work here and
can imagine
things and kept just so much changing
kept and
finally said , and you ca n't do this
that 's right .
buy and stick with it
that 's right .
an opportune one suit
have and
is just to add a mouse and a hard drive
and that 's all i plan to do .
have got the low line
is not a user power , but
so it does n't matter .
is that
work for you
if it does the job , and then that 's what you need
he is looking to get rid of his now .
or public service commitment
is it
too much heard about it
up when there were so much controversy about reviving a draft
have to provide military service to the country ,
an awful lot of young people that would benefit from some sort of public service , like the conservation back in the thirties or other various things of that sort
it seems to me that it 's not a totally bad idea , and
but do n't see how they 'd make it work quite
first my impression was it would be very good .
think that it would be good for people to serve ,
but do n't know if it should be an option
it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that was during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids .
they able to work
some people would get military service and
and some people would get civilian service , like working in hospitals .
do hospital service or things like that
farm work in
there are justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
it 's a possibility .
rather war work in a hospital than to go
and is sure most young men and women would
it was something was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life .
that make sense .
and then you run into the bureaucracy in running it .
you going to cover that many people
because we 've got a lot more people now than then we did
and , in addition to that we have
even if , you have to pay them something .
plus .
that would be expensive in most cases .
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization ,
is on the other hand , but not
do n't know what we got for all the money ,
but do n't know how to cope with their lives better if they really had significant effects in the places where they went , in teaching the people
and were living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me
doing in different situation not a really religious background , if it
because it emphasized that sort of thing did
a lot of self evaluation
it was and voluntary definitely , too .
and not
and is sure that would make , too
what about a voluntary program ?
do you think that would be a good idea ?
the national parks and work
what it is under organization
it 's a government run if it 's a private charity that is put together it
n't either
the ones
work forestry and .
they
they put up and
fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort and .
's and
but there may be other things .
is not so sure
, it 'll do them in the long run
it 's a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble , probably
is on whether it 's something that they can put to economic use , but later
's from the inner city
back to the inner city , if they may not see , much less be able to take care of them .
that 's true .
point good
so that may not benefit them in the long run .
is
is going to have to go ,
's other my line
thank you .
but it was good to talk to you .
too
it 's very easy for anybody to find out about you .
n't really very much like that
somebody find out all that stuff
it was just as a demonstration to show those who was watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person .
mostly it dealt with marketing companies , these direct marketing , associations .
that was
and they are able to do that through the manipulations all of the computer .
that 's not really good .
, do n't know
that 's an invasion of privacy
that is not for an everyday thing , though ,
feel that much an invasion of privacy are pretty
the opening office ?
is that
but you really do n't have any privacy at all .
can be seen easily
and it 's not just that ,
the whole thing about
sometimes it 's almost impossible to do because your space is not your own space
a situation like that
kind of and have a problem with that really
do you work
there is anybody who do n't ?
are out there
you are working at
but my own environment is totally open .
there 's nothing to block anything .
so
changing ever so rapidly in
such data on anybody that you have to do all large
it appears in , and
the government sell information to private companies about individuals or families
is that
and it should n't be that way .
do n't think that are either quite right
is not really government , for the people and by
'll tell you that
think could be done about it ?
of these clowns that is serving in the office
is the only thing that can be changed
.
n't see to like that anything
it be ideal goal for that to be done one common
, do n't know
insofar as we are able to obtain information that it is still a free country
and would n't
or , it 's
but it 's hard to define a lot of those boundaries .
it 's really .
is a bureau credit
they take my name , which is a very common name ,
and my last name is even more common
name against their list
they and .
just under that name everything and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all .
they do n't even check my social security number .
companies paying them good money to report accurately
and they are not ,
they are so lazy .
they are just not doing it .
they just find your name
it and up .
you have to write long this detailed letter , and everything like that to them ,
and then it takes three weeks and all .
and is baloney
.
is in the letter them ?
have taken to doing
n't and
the agency credit you 're
we are paying good you money
and you 're not doing your job .
good idea .
have taken to doing lately ,
and it seems to work pretty well so far .
that 's good .
any other problems ?
not can think of
probably , can go on
probably better back to work
it 's nice talking .
again .
go there .
how way back
what is that ?
is that right ?
is he still so
that is interesting .
saw them ,
was out there last summer ,
that 's the stadium ?
could n't tell you for sure
it 's been a long time .
used to be a race track so
was there
think that 's right
so had a lot of fun
minor league baseball , a lot
it is cheaper for one thing .
that 's true .
but they never have been able to do more than one of those in any given year .
for a odd year this year
n't either
he ca n't field
and he strikes out a lot ,
but he is that done for five years .
get rid of him now
he is not the liability that he was , that he used to be .
, so what he strike out a lot
who but that does n't mean get
all they can do is hit home runs and strike out which they did .
deep enough that it does n't matter
it may be .
them a lot
think they are going to go all the way
like and by saying
is a giants fan from way back
but did n't butler hurt either .
who are the last one
he 's a pretty decent pitcher .
he is .
the short stop , and that guy is going to be good .
it should be an interesting year .
already have been to game one ,
and should have been to two
mostly
do and enjoy them
three hundred miles .
how big states sometimes out there
it is incredible .
go there .
and last year and saw a bunch of the year teams before the cardinals and cubs
a baseball fan
try to see
having a kid this fall ,
lots of baseball games to
so while you can do it .
.
it 's been good talking .
good talking with you
would n't mind it
probably even though my prediction will be right
good and talking with you
good and talking with you
take care .
you do have any children ?
n't
n't
do you ?
have one
a year old daughter five
child care
.
stayed off over of a year when she was born with her for little work
her and then at a private sitter for two , two and a half years after that have
and how you did choose that sitter ?
of people a
she and turned out .
do n't think
send to a day care
want n't her to go to a day care
this lady , and you would
she 's real good .
it 's hard to find people like that .
it is .
and she is really , really doing good and learning a lot .
have started working up in the afternoons there , too , actually , and
is that
i guess
is going to quit as soon as the school season is over
being there with her up
for her
she stay that much longer
do they have classes for them during the summer , too ?
year-round going
now , they have a lot of trips field in the summer .
if there 's a trip field just about every day .
it 's a lot more lax .
but still going through all their curriculum as usual .
what kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took over there her ?
both went
we kind of give her the third degree .
is glad to hear that
we went to her house over ,
we just told here we 'd be over that day .
we did n't tell her when .
specifically clean or anything for me
and she had a daughter ,
want to say around and first , second grade
and kept at the time she
but it was only a part-time basis .
so , we went over there
we questioned her about and she and how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school , stuff like that
really we and .
your daughter to
she still love and her to death .
to death each
or either buying her things ,
so , we 're
so she stayed with her about , roughly two years ,
she had to go back to work , and
they have some other expenses as came up
so she had to go get a real job .
get a real job , full time
and the , stuff like that
by some friends of ours
but it 's an older place .
all the new places was near us
place
they did n't play just long all day , and
they did a lot
trying to incorporate a little bit of it into
it and they made sure they out .
did n't take her
i just kind let what she felt and of go , see like doing .
them , and she went outside if somebody come with them
so felt more comfortable , at that place
that is , the true test .
and she was real comfortable .
really , done really good and
much been , or how much are just her
but , she seems to me to be pretty quick and smart
and she is already
that 's good .
she and turned five just last month .
that 's good then , .
think so .
school at her the whole time
but ,
she is going to have to face
go here .
that 's right .
that just hate
but .
so , you do n't have any children .
have a nephew
he is a little brat .
is not real bright ,
but he is always sick .
he got cold or something , some kind of
and do n't know ,
do n't think this place is a very good place for him
it 's just kind of convenient
and she is
that 's a shame .
do n't think she check out things very well
that 's scary , .
it 's scary .
was
known
would be , too
, do n't know
that 's just it .
do n't mind paying more
do n't know
is what 's really going on and
that 's right .
think that 's an ideal situation
because at her school up as soon as you
they
and they have callers car
and some kid gets the kid
and , it 's time to go .
always at first of me that
not
but 'd like to see what she is doing
it 's hard to get them out , and
a lot of parents and have places to go and things like that .
that 's right .
it 's late at night , and
so it now do n't bother me at all
is not sure what the street , is
is it near country club ,
that one is set back , ?
have seen
that 's it .
actually have never seen the place itself , but
far back , off the road
and that 's
that little kinder care
this is on a highway , too .
there is a difference .
to death my child , might accidentally get out
or , if that seems like a real accessible to place where you could go , in and get .
that 's right .
a accident or car .
and , that was
and it was
and of course , it was
but
did n't base everything on that
because that
that 's right .
that is exactly right .
some kids in there
and it is , over .
have , but
on wood
to death
, do n't know
do
drugs , everything else , and
would be , too
how soon
and that scares me .
known
it 's scary .
they do in school teach them right now where she is at about drugs ?
had and talk to them about it
no concept of drugs , what in the world
and what to do when they .
just think of her , but
is n't that , sixth grade ,
and that 's a big gap .
it is .
honestly and can see
can see it , too ,
those kids getting
probably is a little too over and
but you have to be nowadays .
nothing wrong with that
.
do n't think there is anything wrong with that
was
but , it is now easy .
now
what your mom and dad always used
that is exactly right
and .
but .
are
planning on having kids
we 'd like to .
that 's good .
because they are
what 's your one that you 've seen most recent ?
have n't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months ,
have n't really so
four or five movies probably a week but
, used to do that too
but have n't been doing lately
we 've got a video good place out here
and recently have seen
, have n't seen
it 's good ?
,
from a woman
but usually n't
what type of movies do you like ?
action .
two of my favorite lethal weapon movies is probably and two lethal weapon
two of most my favorite
they 're really good just movies .
on a wire and i like bird .
do you like movies suspense
like just action or do you
what do you mean
you talking about movies like hard dying two
fatal attraction or
like that ,
that was pretty good .
that was okay ,
it was
but so many people said it was n't .
do n't run across them
, do n't know
, did n't just find
it was
what was all your favorite movie time ?
ca n't
was really most in the shock with
did not really expect the special effects or anything like that when that first came out
have never out of all the movies
were ready to go back and again see
you 're right about that ,
really an all time
do n't think anything could ever beat that
have never seen that
you have n't
should rent it ?
should go rent it tomorrow
that 's a real interesting movie
and it 's got a good historical perspective to it .
is taking in school history
so it probably 'd be a good thing for me to see .
one of his brothers
wo n't give the whole plot away and
but it 's really good a movie .
for many , many years
and he turns out to be a man law .
it 's really interesting
you just gave it away ,
ca n't go see it ,
is that
, did n't give away the whole thing
just gave away just enough
that does sound good ,
it is
it is .
may have to do that
or go rent it .
what 's first his name .
ca n't remember his first name
, do n't know
do n't watch that
ca n't even remember the name
he said he would n't really talk .
he did n't think he was such a good guy action .
ca n't remember
ca n't remember the guy 's name
did n't care for really
do n't think he is really a very good actor
so many people
that 's pretty good .
, do n't know
, just have never seen
good a combination of movies with the exception of horror films
do n't watch horror really very many films at all
n't either
, do n't know
you 're right .
that , it 's this and .
just do n't enjoy it because it 's just come on , give me a break so
many of them and so done so poorly
it does n't even just give you the effect ,
some of them done good
and they do scare you .
, do n't know
is not really into those
that was one of my favorites ,
thought that was a very good movie
with that one
it was
had ever
and it was so well done ,
students might try to do it .
and it 's not like there 's a lot of scientific data on it .
that is probably true .
but it was a very good movie .
it was done well real too .
there was n't any part of it that you really felt this ca n't happen .
it seemed real ,
it was really good .
it 's not all my favorite movie time
but it was good ,
it was really good .
and do n't know if you , like
thought pretty woman was a really good movie , too , but
that was a great movie .
we 've seen that two or three times .
we waited
rent and
but it was really good .
, have n't
have even
it must have what is his name in it .
it does n't ,
is
that must be pretty good then ,
it good was .
it is ,
a poor men 's pretty woman in
but it was
, though that was a really cute movie
enjoyed that
it was .
there was another one ,
have n't
see that one
that is probably true ,
that is probably true .
it 's very , very good .
very good
was really glad when it won because it really deserved it all those awards
and he signed it .
and he signed it .
he happens to be a friend of one of her business associates .
that is impressive .
but we got a nice picture
try to get out there and see
it 's really worth it .
it 's a very good movie
and would suggest at the theater seeing it
know they are playing it still
pushed it , to they and back ,
and then when
but
is that one
it 's really good .
and did n't think that one was near as good
it was okay ,
it was all right ,
do n't know
not yet , and his crime was considered a capital crime for whatever reason
and the , men have quite honestly
, do n't know
our prison system up
'll only
capital punishment uh is
but you still have to pay your visa bill .
that 's right .
you still have to ,
a genuine turnaround in a person 's character and
.
you did ?
have a degree in social work
you see it the ones that have a genuine character change .
it 's obvious .
and they know .
someone from the governor ,
are saying ,
they 're not going to go , without going through of authority in the prison every channel .
so i like
punishment .
thank you ,
is
just got home from work
is that
can be changed ,
right then .
we do n't have a speedy trial ,
we do n't have speedy punishment
lose , so if it kind and of
n't
is still there , but
the foundation is still there , though , of the system ,
what you 're saying ,
but also , because they are under a law
we just have been taken out from under a law .
under the law if your child back talks you , because he would be stoned .
that is correct .
under the law he would
from being under the law
but we 're still accountable to it .
we do n't need to back talk ,
in the new , but he is looking at your heart
by their changes character is that
mean , and it 's like looking
, unless there is a true change of character
agree on that , very strongly
we just have to trust the authorities
and they 're not going to excuse people , if it was like that run ,
there would be very few exceptions to that probably
and if it was done quickly and done swiftly
the answer to all these problems
some of what goes through our courts and is a total waste of time .
because we 're suit happy .
at least as far as capital punishment to the capital situation is
could if that automatic appeal that goes in
and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way
,
him could be a her .
know they have crimes punishable by death ,
is sure they hit a every few now and then , and
and would n't
know that they have their , crime rate , but
ca n't remember which ,
my husband is going .
and they do n't have a lot of the crime because there is a law
and the law is enforced .
the law is not being enforced
all these kids and was up on there getting arrested for crack
we were across from that big bus station ,
you , called
and , you 'd see the same kid who was back out there in two days .
that 's sad .
because , not the answer is being given to them , in the court system
and it was an integral part , really
and
you ca n't force people ,
people hurting
and they 're out doing crack sitting on the street .
they were mostly that the kind of people , we would want to receive it .
, do n't know
you know .
, known
you 're right ,
they would
and that
is what is my role in this thing , what is my part ,
is the system
it ... is
but it 's
about how you ?
we try to go , maybe twice a summer once .
pretty to me
we do n't go long thing for the week .
do you tent camp
a tent
that 's how i too camp .
me too
of that the rest is really
'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother ,
so , is that really wild .
are
a five year
the kids
known
just .
for them to be outside
, known
they do n't have all these modern toys and ,
and rocks and stuff
like and
it 's pretty fun .
it is really a good thing family , done .
that have children also
and that makes it
plus we do n't have to go out and buy ,
we kind of
good planning
even the sleeping bags , those
have so and
you 're right .
do you have a boat ?
want one bad
do you ?
would love
but that 's
too would
too would
see 's
we try to go to a lake .
and , so we 'll go to a lake where they can go do that .
we 're close enough so they can do that ,
and the girls can play on the beach area .
would play on the beach too area and
would do
that is fun .
is what a good time the computer 's going to have with that
what 's really funny but ?
and there 's
you do n't sound like it to me .
here only about six years
have you ?
, so if it must be very , very slight .
that 's true ,
that 's true .
do n't
have more of a twang , to my voice
sure
all my life
good for you
we went , actually last summer .
this ,
is
is not really familiar
there are ?
that would be fun , though , to go .
on this summer 's vacation was
'd love that
it takes a lot more planning .
it does ,
so , we are hoping to do a weekend three days .
do n't
have n't
think it 's around two hours from here
and it has dinosaur tracks and stuff like that
that sounds great .
it 's got one of those wildlife parks and .
think that 'll be fun
so we 're going to try to do that on a weekend three days , go there
have n't
where
it is beautiful .
it is ?
absolutely beautiful

but would love to camp , in the mountains
that 's what my girlfriend says .
she love that place .
you need go there .
she love that .
there is little this mountain lakes and
and it 's very peaceful .
what type of
all the leaves , but turn yellow
and it 's just brilliant .
i love that
you would .
you 'd like it very much .
is that
is that
know
was too
all the time
got real used to it then
like
we did ,
we really did .
that 's it .
you say you have n't been in years ?
have n't
is a single struggling mom
thank you .
time 's
's money .
have n't been able to do it ,
and that was one of the i things really thought .
is a little bit fearful of trying just that women and
do n't blame you
you know
do n't blame at all you
it would have been fine years ago
little one vacation
and that was great .
and stayed in a nice place
but it 's not to have real different .
you know .
can imagine
is just a chicken
what would do lots of it
do n't
have n't ?
so it was a good plan
have n't yet , but
have you ?
got into sales ,
is selling telephone systems and
is that
it is fun and
and it is interesting ,
but it is also
have n't started yet making money and
is n't it hard
so
it 's hard .

is so old
you 're not old .
you 're not at all old .

do you need to go ?
is going to listen
if should answer , at night we
that 's very smart .
have so
me too
and good luck .
, how many calls
have n't
have you ?
my only about one second
how many
you do know ?
had about four
four ,
that 's good .
very good
that 's four each .
you interested in
and it is virtually anything .
'll talk about anything to anybody
n't
bet
bet .
and it 's been real interesting , the different personalities .
known
always try to find out where they are from ,
because it is
it 's really .
so you can go get the door you go
thank you .
and enjoyed
me too
you think of me
thank you .
to go ahead .
and pick the baby from the baby sitter
is too
some things on the radio
the newspaper on the weekends
, do n't even have , time to read the newspaper except in passing
'll look over my husband 's shoulder and see
work say
a thing news on
and it 's pretty much headline news .
for which are n't pretty much
what do you think about it ?
it 's pretty good
there 's a lot of competition in the media .
trying to figure out who is going to get the best headlines too much
and they try to play 's public opinion .
the case of
that ,
so , it will .
think what else
do n't know what to say
that 's a bad one ,
see
we can deduct that from our federal income tax .
but we need good schools .
in now that more
think it 's better if we had better schools for everybody and
that 's true .
would think they could find ,
could they 've got a lottery
they are struggling with it .
the lottery could
as in state income tax painful as
paid the same amount
but it is not the idea of your paying income tax .
is not sure that there is a positive solution for that
see what happens
think what else
of days a
on things are a little behind
that 's sad .
they choose between the better of the two bad situations
know in the situation
it make you wonder why we did n't go ahead and go in on and finish the job , while we were in there
all these people jump down , even though
should have gone in there
helped though
it did a lot .
a real good job
and they stayed active .
it was a new situation .
'll
really do n't have much more to say
's than the weather
you 're right ,
we got some awful rain the other morning .
we did last night .
apparently do n't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes this way , too , up
some damage
it did ?
we may get more some tonight .
just we 've got slight chances of rain .
here is so flat ,
and it is
are we
last week , we have all the rain ?
think we have about eight inches
eight inches here
walk on you and out ,
it is awful .
it is
it 's a lot more down that way .
in fact ,
is that it
that 's about as much as we can do with current events .
it was nice talking .
but never had a clear direction on which way to go with it really
would love to see
kids learn at different rates
together for too long and they have
you 'd learn at this rate
and that 's the only way it 's going to happen .
that 's true .
some kids that 'll pick up in the first three minutes you , is talking on it
that 's very true .
one picks up real quick
and the other one does n't .
and you 're right ,
really fast , if they already known
you do
what 's your suggestions ?
out of each child
out of each child
each individual child
some kids going to be great with mechanical stuff
kids other going to be really into math
some going to be heavy into reading
instead of pushing too far the scales either direction it is
but why not hit the points the kid 's really interested in ?
if he is interested , because he is going to study it ,
he is going to learn it , and
and he is going to remember it .
that 's true .
they would argue about that
that might be the only thing .
definitely but
exposure to
they do n't need to be masters of it ,
that 's true .
definitely
there is no doubt about that .
is going to college right now ,
is taking this history class
and it 's so boring ,
just it and .
why do they think and make us take this stuff ?
a computer science
what type of history class is that you are having to take it ?
combine that into one
, you to be giving the foundations of the nation
what they 're doing
they are almost trivial .
.
they were great men ,
and they are the father of the country and all this .
he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else .
if not more .
that 's true ,
tell ,
saw something on the news maybe two weeks ago
do n't know where you 're from ,
they have , not a table , but a in this closet desk ,
and they have to sit in there by themselves .
was parents why my child 's
how that are helping my child
we are giving them isolation time they said
this and helped them to think .
are if the concept isolation
that 's true .
that 's true .
but
with parents
think that 's a very wrong way to handle disciplining a child
putting them in their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms
they showed on the news , but these rooms
a closet to
they said , but one of the solutions they come up with was of these isolation rooms to take off the doors
said how this is helping ?
have definitely disagree with that
think that 's not the way to a child discipline by putting him in a closet
, then came in
so now .
a middle
there be some sort of discipline
put him into a situation
you broke the ruling ,
you 're going to have to pay for it .
's , but
that 's true .
the kid is having to play up wrong time to pay for what he did his debt .
see what come out of it
but
for instance , one of the things at
if they are being really good not they are cutting up , and so on when
, what they call their caught
they then and spend these like money
they 're going to be good and try and earn those things to get the positive part of it .
so , they are definitely going to work .
, but not applies in society itself inside the public school system
there 's been too much negative reinforcement .
that 's true .
but really do try to use positive reinforcement with them at home , also
really it and .
, but when
but that 's just my personal opinion ,
do n't think that law ever will change
do n't ?
but do n't know
of killing over a
an even line but somewhere .
there are so many parents that says them .
you can .
things that they need that
in your spare time
who have spare time ?
used to
used to do ornaments and things salt
but that was good many years ago
my spare time
usually going
that 's , and about it .
understood that
i work full time
have two kids and
my spare time involves usually so with the kids something .
it 's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend .
we like to go out , ,
family .
just do n't look very good , and
you have their birth date on them , and then
and then you have a little picture of them
them and stuff
nothing but steady
there 'll work ,
like it 's not
at all .
do n't
my mother and used
and do n't
that a lost art from this family 's
but , it 's not a very good topic
it seems like it is easier to just go out and buy .
what , it 's like there , n't
and you can go to a market and stuff flea
and there 's just tons of stuff everywhere
just in their garage people and
weekends and then on and that they sell it
and and during the week .
and they make it cheaper for us to buy .
was it
you felt very creative .
and the different steps and things
we 're
think we did the five minutes ,
so we do n't have to keep talking .
thank you .
i hope you have a good rest of your weekend .
, this is n't it
about something really can you talk
do n't know what we 're going to do about it ,
but it 's certainly who something has a lot of .
it 's such a big area when
and there are so many different problems there .
want
it does n't matter to me .
'll tell you ,
and they 're really arrogant quite .
they believe
have and
they consider them second class .
they 're really arrogant quite .
do n't know if that contribute to the problem
did they feel about the united states
but did n't talk about with her that really
and they are nothing but really servants for them ,
like second class citizens
they do n't really want around them
really they but
they look down on them .
and do n't know ,
because we give everybody pretty much of a doubt the benefit .
they 're terrible ,
it 's just like it 's a dog eating world dog .
all my black friends and here
they do n't go out and
and they send to school their kids
them go to college and stuff
so it 's just a different world .
they said and you have quite the problem with the ghettos ,
, do n't know
but do n't think it 's any different of a problem than any other major city
heard but that it had just a really bad problem
there 's a lot of crime ?
there are quite a bit of crime .
up so here
it 's really strange .
you could go walking there and pretty much not fear for your life ,
and we 're
so they do n't have that .
it 's just
you want to do something for them ,
the country
in their civil war
but we 've kind of these driven people out .
to do it
and that 's what they did
now they 're asking for help him and
and he is .
my husband , have very strong feelings
think the war ended too soon
that 's what everyone says .
it is to say that real easy .
we did n't damage enough of their arsenal .
we damaged most of it
made sure we got
do n't think the higher ups was thinking about what 's going to do with the rest of his machine war this guy
they are going , it 's not going to hurt us
are we so
they right to their goals
what they were going to say .
they were playing it very safe ,
say
too bad that he did n't just have to do just the go ahead to do it
was more than any of us
did n't realize were going to make it
really for these people
middle class people
and you knew this ,
these people going to come
was they and if you were in your house
of course , you 're just going
and you 're going to run .
and it 's just too bad that we could n't see .
still feel like there 's more to come .
settled , as far as
was
, known
it 's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict
, but do n't know
have just
if the world could have given them maybe some type of aid and .
it is
, do n't know
you 're damn right ,
is going to protect my family ,
was so
was really proud of them , though , that they stayed out of it ,
can tell if they had got into it , it would have started a whole new war .
that part scared me .
saw atomic bomb just , and
do you want to start ?
have seen lately
you did see the movie ?
we 've seen ,
you did like it ?
it was great ,
you seen had it ?
thought it was very well done
about how ghost ?
we liked it , an
but did n't think it was as good as it all the hype was about
the same way about that too
was
getting a nomination for best picture
see 's
i videos rent but
do you ?
many
with the wind , and the older movies
'd like to see ,
these , some day that
that was good .
that was good ,
and have been wanting to see
but we walk into the video store
do n't see this now
it is true .
one of the movies we saw recently , we saw misery .
did n't see that one
that was good ,
it was great .
there is a couple scenes , at
there are , some blood , and everything
there is not blood
but it 's a really good movie .
the guy gets
he is a writer
and she is his biggest fan
we have n't ,
, saw one that
that one was n't that great either .
it was n't ?
, did n't think so
heard mixed reviews of that ,
that 's on our list of things to see .
, known
if you have seen
our big thing is here up prices movie
think it 's six bucks now in the theaters ,
just a lot of other we stuff and then on tape out .
that is too us ,
true .
, known
it 's too bad that they 've got so expensive .
you have
it was great .
it was ,
it 's an odd film
part of it ,
never really watched the whole thing
he 's , a very odd man
think he is very interesting
liked and those two movies of his a lot
that was pretty good , though , really .
it was good ,
it takes to make some of those kind of movies when .
of hours or an hour a
you look at the scenery and the cars and all the different stuff like that
who 's your favorite actress or actor ?
do n't really know ,
is a big baseball fan , but
that was good ,
movie that too saw
that was very good .
which one ?
field of dreams
field of dreams , were good
and liked the other movies he is done
no way out were really good
who was that with ?
's see
the title , sounds familiar
it was
think it was a movie or two and a half hours three hour , and
if had n't cut out they
but it was really good .
would remember , with him in it
how about revenge ,
you did see that with him ?
, did n't
that 's any good ?
it was ,
like everything he is done so far
it is one of those movies that it 's not a great movie
was but
we were in the video store today
and somebody was recommending it to somebody .
was recommending it to somebody else
it was not a bad movie .
'll have to catch it one of these days
you seen no way out said you ?
that was excellent .
that was very good .
wanted to see
were in fact
cable ?
or two weeks ago
saw something about it
it was originally in the theaters
saw part of it again and
there are and this one actor ,
him a lot
do n't know him
you 've seen probably him
that 's what is the guy .
do you
do n't think so
did you see ever the movie star man .
do n't
but he 's always a lot of fun in every movie he 's in
he was the accountant .
who
do n't shrink the kids
but he 's not .
was thinking
, but have seen
.
think it 's kind of good entertainment
how about some of the ads ,
you look at them or the reviews
do they influence you a lot .
wo n't usually a review
want to see it
that was pretty good .
my girlfriend 's part seen one and two part although she saw them years ago , but
, you should if you can see those first
if it is even better .
the book was excellent .
, have n't
never .
it was not bad
expected more
so , it was a movie fun .
do you like his stuff ?
cocktails
that was good ,
they sound .
saw parts of those probably
'll start watching a movie
and is
especially if there is
the titles and then might sound familiar
but really do n't know what they are all about
they are all pretty good ,
saw one that
, do n't know
is not a great real follower football ,
two basic teams that
,
every year .
it is funny .
how about that
enjoyed but always
and there 's always been an interest there .
kind of
up in southern new jersey
they were thirty miles right up the river and
with those things you grew up
but , they were
is going to take this year
they are going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year
in a way that this past season , happened
maybe , maybe they will come through and do something this year
i look for it to be a pretty good year .
of years ago a
they did ,
and got a lot of names in that we were n't familiar with
some of them , turned out to be pretty good players
some of them did n't
at least hope it will
the playoffs for the last few years to
but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there .
and they 've got a lot of the tools to do it ,
but if they ca n't put it just together ,
but they have always been a really strong team .
without a whole lot of big players name and
they 've got a few on offense and defense anchors
have managed with those guys and
and do n't know
gets the pressure
i guess ,
it is funny , over the years .
ever since he left
do n't know why it 's hard to find these days so
that says , though a lot for his ability .
in history that can really perform , through
every team hope their current quarterback is going to pull through them .
the guy winds hurt but up getting .
tell ,
so many expected big things
they did .
they put a lot of pressure .
watching them play
he probably , is like a lot of quarterbacks
when really is the pressure on when it is down to the last few minutes of the game for the season 's when
n't quite figured out that ,
they say , and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes .
so do n't know
are looking for a good year
we 're always looking for a good year
though obviously , do you think they are going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the super bowl this year
like this year to do that you ?
do n't think the cowboys have got a chance
they probably will win one or two games more than they did this year
and they 'll get close to it .
get up everybody 's hopes
so who is going to beat them ?
they going to blow to it
that 's a good question .
is not real sure
of them
they did .
these changes going to help or hinder the team
sometimes in new motivation
and all you can do is
be sure , but
that 's true .
those guys tough
they tough
and they are big ,
they are
you do n't do something
sure that was a fun super bowl to watch this year .
was n't pulling for either team
but that was just a good football game .
and it is , funny .
but he 's a good quarterback .
he 's got a good arm ,
it is sometimes
a l
l
trying
, was just up there
about inches seven of
that will make the skiers happy .
they got up in the mountains just west of there that much .
bet .
good to talk to you .
you guys , have a good time
keep those printers coming
we 'll do it .
to go ahead .
, as still , the soviet union is a threat to the western civilized world
absolutely .
on the newspapers , but only what
do n't see as they used to be , as much of a threat
just the instability of the country but right now .
the soviet union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat .
of the soviet art weapons all
do consider a threat them ?
absolutely .
they 're teaching terrorism .
let me and tell you ,
nothing to go up against nice
these guys top of the line
they can when pull anywhere in the free world terrorist actions .
very , very good
the entire , quote , old guard of the soviet government
that would jeopardize a lot of people .
each one of those sectors
in positions over some of these states soviet
it looks to as it is that .
they are showing remarkable restraint .
they would , and .
wo n't and
and they can do that in about four minutes .
if , then the gas nerve definitely will get you .
only the drawback on that little piece of they 're machinery
that much fuel
, have you
any time in
have n't
a lot of
during that time same frame , but they are getting all these weapons and stuff that
with all this stuff did n't ?
the most recent conflict
.
in the foot ourselves
it is
it is a matter of money , to a certain extent .
know they are supplying that many people with weapons
the ones to
they 're not really .
a situation up
'll give them that
the situation down
and it 's very up .
inflation is out of this world
supported for years
the people get
and they 're tired of it ,
from under it even if that means communism going to
only the drawback with the entire thing
and is that he had his problems with some of the old guard himself
true .
, do n't know
my back on them
thought that was great
do but by
a much than what we used to over there have reduced force
you still have better , but the key players in place
be able to walk the walk
to back up what it 's say
there , if you 've got a token force only you ca n't
at least they are learning a little bit from history .
my bike
have a stationary bike and a regular bike
ride my regular bike outside
the stationary bike is so boring .
.
have head phones , but
have it in the living room
or , we have a fish tank ,
the fishing
keep done
it kind of takes the time away
after a walk and then take usually usually
just that kind of and to get quite as
but it is definitely a task .
think so ?
ca n't
did more enjoy it ,
want to
bought a stationary bike ,
if , it hurts
have n't and
it and .
just .
so it 's
it is totally women .
my biggest problem with
do n't feel like having a bunch of other people
so have tried to do just stuff at home
feel and just
is not
still do n't like other people watching me , but
being a little bit too low
and my bathing suit is just one piece ,
all the way around so there is no big deal ,
are doing it
and it 's a total free relaxation .
because you can
you 're
and they 've got fantastic in there such equipment .
that 's great .
how
the aerobics water and .
the water aerobics
do they have a pool
they 've got a nice one .
they have two types of water aerobics .
that are really good for you to do
because you are pushing against the water in itself .
are you
so you 're doing it yourself .
so you do n't feel like you really are working hard that , do you really
when you 're in the water ?
was , every time i stop
end up .
that 's funny ,
would never
just so they wear them right into the pool .
shoes water
no one big deal
that 's really funny .
so big no deal .
but it is fun .
do find yourself going ?
if you 're doing it , on a regular basis how often do you go ?
try to make it at least three times a week
just , going five days a week
could make myself exercise every day
at least three times a week
but it is at least something .
do n't really enjoy it to me
have to do it
it 's not
about four thirty and actually 'd be at the swimming pool .
was so there by four thirty , every night
was getting my hair and the only thing ever bothered me
did what it
so it 's
enjoyed higher , but it
is
is that
you did try ever that ?
have a bad back ,
is so
can walk ,
when you 're on cement or anything that are hard , especially
it will bother me .
it will bother me .
the water aerobics would be the best thing for you probably
what pushed for the water aerobics was n't
went in there to strengthen strictly my back muscles
go for the swimming pool
she say just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor .
she say in more .
is not a swimmer
water
is not
across the pool
no swimmer per
found this really worked well , but
come out of there and
saw and my stomach going well down
just by watching .
they and up with a diet , who worked real good .
what if you are already on one
i
what ?
a diet ?
there , they would when
they have nothing to do with that .
and all your history
and they show you everything to do and how to do it , and the whole nine yards .
so it became part of the package ,
through it went so
it well worked out .
but they have the exercise program .
you 're saying ?
just you can go in there , and just too join like anywhere else .
,
now less than for going there , after all this time in
went back in there
all the same treatment again
so it 's
like it
the heat
i jump out of the swimming pool ,
it and .
that would be nice really .
maybe gone home
but that 's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did .
was pushing too far
it 's no big deal .
it is fun .
it is fun .
have gotten on the bike
the stepping bike
, watching and down stairs that
most of the others to me very dull
got , but instead talked into the bike
and do n't know ,
is considering maybe even buying one of those too
'll get benefit out of both of them
do n't know if it really would do any good having of them both
feeling is
very easily
just the bicycle is the nice one thing about you
it would
apply to either a health club or one of the others
because you can buy a month 's membership .
at home here on the bike
up go down
can sit there and read and listen to music , like what you said , so
and it has no effect on me .
so it is boring .
public service for everybody one year
was that it ?
who wants to start this one ?
, do n't know
, have been sitting thinking
it took
what thinking about this
if the first thing is
everybody , not just poor people and all that but senators 's sons and all that stuff
everybody 's
, do n't know
it 'd be good , probably
that does n't sound right .
of view that
in
do n't
was many of my peers and
and could see
in their neighborhood be it cleaning out lots , whatever kind of community or public service might be available
not so much a demand
benefits even for those who have the hardest it
just as maybe a good idea that
ways and of that back to others .
something to as being
you 're going to go and fill pot holes , all that stuff .
do n't know
could see a gamut of different kinds of opportunities
it be full time
you 're going to go to this camp
construction that went out and did things
was
it gave some folks ,
and we got some great public works out of it .
but does n't as being necessary now
can see it being done on a regular schedule
everybody put so many hours of public service in a given time , perhaps in
all of us
so much going on that is bad but .
and this would give them a chance to have .
something that they turn back , .
you more like you if you have done something , in it actually is part of the community
that 's right .
take pride in that
being if it is in the area where the person live at least
.
it might not be the same neighborhood , but the same city or county , because you 're coming in contact with it then .
has , on going
that would be a nightmare , .
getting it just going and
things like that , that kind of to get into that
something that participated in , and would take everybody
you do have kids ?
.
we will in about six months .
good .
you 'll have a little time .
many kids that was at loose ends , and that did n't really have when a purpose
and can see some really significant things coming out of it
but that would be a part of selling it to the community .
the adults ahead of it would probably serve to each succeeding generation and never .
, do n't know
around here we have
have seen in other states , too , and it
they have , that here .
, do n't know
you ca n't do that
it was interesting because that 's an interesting question .
should these people
had n't and
that 's an interesting situation .
had n't
do n't remember for sure now
do n't know about your part of the country , and
here in the last year 's just down , but
because they said it is not feasible , down
it 's not a good idea .
kind of along the same line as the mandatory thing
but then business too much , they lost .
it 's just a part of everyone 's consciousness .
it kind of just went out of vogue and then .
and are worried that the same thing will happen
it 's like environmentalism
is it and even if , who cares
have been too many things that it is done , just in my life that for other
, just to bring that one might care
more concern about some of these things that cost us money but .
it make me feel better .
what realize this stuff run
what was when we have the oil last crisis it ?
we started and getting smart
these alternative sources of the energy and so forth
, we do n't have the ability to go on to some new technology now
my dad , is in the solar energy business
sometimes wonder if he knows what he is doing so .
just ca n't go along with
and they are not there me
do n't want the stress
do you want to go first ?
you can go first ,
or will
go ahead .
is going to tell you
it sounds fantastic .
some red pepper over it and .
you can use either the kind that comes in the little
a little bit of that over it and .
you would then use only two of them .
you put , and that
two of beer over it bottles and then .
pounds two
two pounds ,
they wo n't leave the shells on them up just .
the beer over
it and .
then
and they can just
it and as
and is
it and
a glass dish
have one who has a cover on it
for it and then .
it one time and .
at one time
you wo n't when knock your flowers off .
.
just and set in there
, you and microwave
it one time and .
i mix it all together and .
up some white regular just cheese and
you take it out
sprinkle and then you
and , it is done .
that sounds fantastic .
it is good .
around the outside of that
and you have all the different seasonings and stuff ,
just for them little individual cups and then .
and it 's not much work .
but it looks like it .
it too good
those tomatoes little
of my salad to make it look nice and things like that
how many you could serve ?
it serves usually six .
figured about that
that 's good .
out here , we have ethnic so many people .
it and out here ?
so it 's hard ,
food here , too chicken wings and ribs and that kind of stuff
they good
good one thing about living here is down , usually anybody who comes over even if it is out of town guests and stuff
of course .
from down here
beginning to find out how good it is more and more people
it is similar .
it is similar .
a taste of
tails of it , only
it does ?
look like a lobster ?
it looks more like a crab .
it looks more like a crab .
they thin , long or wide
between a crab and a lobster a
because it is small like that
mud them bugs and .
but they 're fantastic tasting .
they so good
,
right now it 's the season for them .
and where did you say ?
the fishing and the chicken , and that kind of stuff
we have a few places
, it on the menu and ever
it 's so good .
you know ,
they do
did have
do n't have it now
you could cook in that it too ,
now you
but do n't know
have never
it does have to get extremely hot ?
but it does n't burn or anything like that .
.
.
and in a bottle , it comes ,
you would cook for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time , it ?
you 're saying ?
and that is so good .
you but do
hot really when
but it 's not like it
and it 's so good .
it is .
.
have a passion for all that type of different tastes
and trying different things
would love to
you come down
you do n't have to go far that south .
as far as the better but the food is of
is that right ?
fact is , we 're going to take this year and a vacation .
and we are going down for the food , though there only .
you do
to the french quarters and stuff like that
living there down
so , and we usually do n't go to the tourist ones .
the ones that
.
we went to this one , and
it was called the porch back .
and they were cooking while we went on this boat ride the stuff .
out , on this porch back
that 's nice .
there is no where you can miss .
and not just been so full
it 's so good .
think what they call their soup
do n't know
.
with seafood that are ?
you can even with chicken make it
you can make with seafood it or .
you can ?
that looks too good .
and it looks delicious .
'll and tell you what
a thing
i wonder ,
the assumption is that it 's a problem ,
it 's not clear to me , but it is .
do n't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions
that is interesting ,
feel it also is a problem ,
your on that
poor blacks vote very little and things like that , for example --
if they were voting , than your average voter vote
but do n't know if that 's the case
of studies on suggest that are n't
apparently they do n't think it 's a problem .
guess not
i vote
really .
is a fan of democracy
vote on
that 's right ,
we have now these state initiatives .
and that was
you vote for yes or no on each of them
and no one could make heads or tails out
was and
we do n't want to have to decide all these things ,
people for us make we
i kind
we was given an opportunity to vote on more things
they speaking for us
but they are not speaking for me .
votes more than
that 's true .
fine with me as long as
that would make me happy though .
, but in a deep philosophical sense in a selfish sense , it would probably
, do n't know
it is interesting ,
some countries 's voting
that 's true ?
, did n't know that
that is one solution to it .
feel about that
that 's not really democratic .
consider what truly democratic
and it 's not for me to say they are not .
you have the right to vote here
as a duty there
just as we have a duty to pay taxes ,
that 's democratic ?
the right to pay taxes in this country
we have the duty to pay taxes .
it 's a duty .
it 's a duty to pay taxes and in that country
and it is
and , it 's not clear that is so much less democratic .
, do n't know
part of me rebels against that but
you start thinking about it
and some people do n't vote ,
they are
or what happens ,
you do n't vote
that is interesting .
people here that
think and
they do n't vote
that 's how i feel .
and you can say something
feel if what 's coming to you but
that 's right ,
certainly and that is , in
is true for
of feeling that way , but as for
any of them , and then the person gets in
think it 's too
it is sometimes a difficult choice .
you do n't feel as though you have much of a choice ,
it is
you have in candidate .
but that is not really a vote of course .
it does n't really gain anything .
it does n't really ,
, is it and so
, do n't know
but just because of a job opportunity
.
is interested
is not
not ,
just .
, quite really how that would work , have ,
you obliged to vote too
out , up until fairly recently even who you did for much
and , is that you are obliged to vote .
, do n't know
part of me are wary
it be more of a duty
maybe they should ,
at least for their first three or four years
is that
certain privileges or come
do n't know
maybe it should go with a driver 's license .
actually
consider a privilege , not a right
that 's a privilege ,
it 's a privilege ,
most people think of it , but as a right .
people got very upset in other words if the government .
but it is actually
it is .
that is correct .
maybe it should be .
if you 're a felon ,
it 's taken away from you if you 're a felon .
they will take away your right to vote , under certain circumstances .
that 's right .
so we do n't have yet do we ,
'd be willing too as a question
have n't
a republic , not a democracy
votes for the issues and republic 's
in other words , for you to vote representatives .
and can protect against the tyranny of democracy ,
as you can have just because , you can have a tyranny of a single bad ruler or something
a very passionate , good argument for
in a fully democratic process the law
you do n't want to be the case that
if there is some minority that people do n't like because of racial hatred or something like that , the majority just simply can vote against them .
cases like that , and need be constrained
do n't
think we 've right now , with congress that sometimes
think they are looking after their own more than they 're looking after the good of the country actually preservation self
and , so they work on that job .
and they are all fools ,
of thing
and , there is somehow if someone is n't as much
think about how i dress for work
on the weekend usually
'll progressively through the week and then wear looking nicer things
that 's a good way to approach it .
do plan my clothes a week in advance
them a month in advance
a month at a time
so do n't repeat an outfit
but do n't work outside of school
the computer lab at school
on for school , have
's jeans or pants in the winter time and then
's college
you have a job , and you have to be right after school or something like that there ,
i work , it 's
it is more like a college campus
when we have meetings department or something like that in
is that
he is a computer engineering and .
was he and
and he just love it .
is that
would hate to be in that atmosphere
but they just moved into the new building ,
he call it the new building .
, do n't know
all the executives
.
he was
do n't take then they wo n't make me to wear it
that 's true ,
that 's a good idea .
he is not really into all that .
he would wear it if he had for his job , and all to
also get off the clothing , and the smokers , you know , how they have the different designated for smokers and stuff areas .
think that 's great
you do smoke ?
so much in the air smoking
the smoking area , it closed in
you do n't smoke
everybody goes in there
full of smoking when
used to smoke a long time ago
used to burn my clothes , talking
used to burn my clothes with cigarettes
is that
have your daughter
when she was in high school did she have to have always
she have a lot of clothes
is that
either , were n't
my daughter , she 's real good at finding , though , sales .
me to
and just have them for the next year
she finds all the outlets and all the discount places
is still learning
is getting much better at it and
is going to be able to make my own clothes and
that 's great .
it into my yet schedule
'd be very interested in
clothes really expensive
they are outrageous !
are it
just a to go .
it 's really outrageous
never this then
but now
who new the designer jeans , was thirty dollars
always and she told me
was going to grow out of next week
pay that kind of money for it especially
she had little a boy
she and finally learned that you can do this , not just .
so she finds the basement sales just like everybody else now .
that is the best way to shop .
being to me
look back now , but
is going to raise the same way mine
, do n't know
it 's just incredible .
try to catch the sales always
always .
and
and you 've just to keep buying them .
if you 're not buying the most expensive clothes out there is not really
there is always
so that has a lot to do with it .
and it was pretty really ,
it had designs leather and some other little things on it
it was pretty so
got it at a real good price , and
that 's great .
and it was pretty so ,
and realized why it was cheap so after
and that 's why it was cheap , so
still , but it 's really
the defect
they really do n't buy ,
they buy
they 'll send them back every time .
in car in a year or so probably repairs
had a similar thing
and that was some time ago ,
try to buy as a car as possible simple
known
or
if , and there 's no way in the world you 're going to work .
there 's no way .
injection fuel on
a woman and asked me who that meant
ca n't work
that is basically it .
regular gas engine
understand , and that
can work on that engine actually
and it was a motor basically
and you did n't have the other junk around it all ,
and you could get to it to work .
have to change , here about a year ago in that the water pump
and it was really fairly easy .
and you can stand just there and work on it .
the hardest part about pump water changes are getting all the junk off , before you can get it too .
that 's true .
you 're right ,
could remember where other all those things went
kind of
took off stuff where it went ,
have too many nuts
brought back here when the car
and do n't know ,
for what you could get for one , you might drive it over a cliff , though , as well
found a outfit here to rebuild it
have got into a long time in
do n't
that 's true .
was in high school
and we used to overhaul basically farm tractors ,
and they were
but as far as
and you can get to them .
you can get to them ,
was the ones in the diesel cars and
, had a lot of good service out of that car
finally gave it to my son , but
and he drove it .
and he finished it off .
you 're right
fallen into unpopular status almost
do n't
is beginning to wonder where do you get gas at
like it was ,
what ,
the availability ?
the diesel availability
do n't
is not looking for it
liked it really
but it turns out what was n't a pickup
but enjoyed sure it .
like because , they 've got plenty of power , what
that was a short stroke engine
it could really wind up .
and it is easy to work fairly
a pickup several years ago
and ca n't remember the size of the engine
, seven or something like that three
on those cars
you 'd open the hood
basically in there but an engine and a few things
now , you open
and it 's scary .
and was under the hood of the other day that look
and like you say you can see the road .
it 's amazing .
if you have to you could climb up in there , and to do what you needed .
you could stand in there , if you really wanted to , i guess .
and he was showing it to me
and we 're looking under the hood
and and
and said
about it never really
wo n't have to change , before i trading
because there a problem getting back against the fire wall
paid any attention to it
and it had all the air pump and all that stuff .
that was really a mess back and under in that van there .
the down motor and
have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things
but that 's good one thing
it is one that 's .
have yet to replace the thing
was to replace that pump water
which belt goes to figure
the inside on a truck
when one of them breaks , it is not the outside one ,
bet
everything else is
everything is
a pleasure you
how many times have you done ?
have done probably seven or eight of them
this is the first one in a week or so .
any calls in two weeks
known or what , if ,
's if
the of times of getting answers a difficult time
you go
thanks for talking
was pretty young while it was going on
and a lot of i things probably
was worth the cost in dollars and lives
that was one of the questions that she asked to think about us ,
because we never went to war .
to winning it and getting out
like it went on and on
feel like just in to be policeman
and are not sure that is our role ,
with that
were fairly at the time too young ,
do n't really have very many memories about it at all , in fact
do n't you think that 's why we have it this time maybe ?
it 's been too long in coming
was so
to the folks that there was fighting it
those guys and there were doing their duty .
that 's right ,
they were n't there by choice
and think we learned from that
the hard way and .
it was a tragic mistake ,
over the years
and are not sure you can undo the damage that was done , emotionally on so many of the people
do n't think you can
the difference between the two wars time allowed to see a lot of people
or the lives lost to fight that war
they are still not settled over there .
they are not .
think we 're going to end up in a few years if not sooner back there
then he and
out
you helping us
think that it would too
do n't think he would do that ,
think we learned too much of the effects
with that
known , that they felt like we were going for a good cause in probably
and the right thing to try and help beat the communism
in the long term effects of the war
he said that 's what we were going there to do
and he did what he said
you or more of a political action and ca n't really do as another country .
my biggest problem with all of these wars are
and we have here at so many problems .
we do n't that
that 's right .
known
believe and
anybody else from walking in and doing it
think there 's a lot of waste
taking care of all these countries all other across the world who end up just using
, known
maybe we 're not any more big their bad enemy
think that 's good , and
think that 's a good ,
a lot of good
think so too .
opened after years and years of that war that , a lot of eyes
we learned from it
there was n't war
but do think we that learned
they do n't know there for what they were still .
of accomplishment , no goal no
we went in
what did we but .
we lost lives
was and what
who know
that 's true .
think you 're right , and
think you 're right there
do remember when it was over
when they were coming .
but back then ,
this country been behind this war
a lot of
is not for war ,
was right
our guys over there
it is and sad
we should n't be fighting a war and
let 's support
felt like they got too much media coverage and publicity way
because those kind of people , they are
have a cause
and because you 're supporting the troops that you are supporting the war , nobody says .
that 's right .
that 's right .
you have to support
that 's right .
and those people do n't see that for some reason .
they do n't see it as supporting the folks , the people .
n't
would agree with you there
.
he said look ,
to the war
a lot of
over there by what you 're doing
a lot of it kind of after that stopped and .
they are not helping anybody .
is that
they are not doing anything for anybody except themselves .
that 's true .
and do n't even know what they 're doing for themselves
giving a soapbox to stand on
but is
all these years trying to deal emotionally
nobody really about that , for them , five years ever until the past four
that 's true .
do n't know
you want to say on this
not guess .
that the first time
, known
off all the time , too
usually can talk all day
but this is something to me that are sad .
it is .
have a good day
the conversation and .
same here
what do you think about the metric system ?
have you tried much with it ?
it 's a whole lot with easier .
to use you mean
because it just makes absolutely
and it 's so easy to convert from one set of units to another .
in the united states and in
with pounds and inches
to centimeters inches , to kilograms pounds and
that 's right .
a they went waiting ,
going to do the math
and get used to it from scratch ,
still ca n't convert back and forth from to centimeters inches
but is comfortable using either perfectly
it 's hard to seriously take it .
and do n't read , just basically , as long as
the miles per hour one
the other one must be for someone else .
that 's right .
, do n't know
this mess from them
that 's right ,
it 's all their fault .
our fault more than
more able than we were
we 're going to start using the now things just
is necessary for them than for us much more
that 's true ,
that 's true probably
there is an expression for that ,
back , with on
never heard
that 's very nice .
is so for the metric system and converting over all
is the way to do it 's just start giving weights have a very brief transition period
remember me getting a package of something that , said one pound
this is a package of dates ,
it presumably was
it said one pound
do n't think it could ever happen with a quick transition
n't
think that would be the easiest way
people could cut completely two or three years before
was thinking by quick transition ,
switch all at midnight tonight .
they did switch ?
so
think they did it overnight and
you cause ca
that is an example of something you ca n't do gradually .
that 's true .
it does .
interesting .
that was something that have to be done quickly because of external circumstances ,
is sure
think it is essential that it is to do so
a little more attention to human psychology
the whole reason to go to over metric after all , is to have round numbers and
with thirty seconds of an inch
so
was the thing that was best about metric
really think .
that
saw the other day that
do n't
so
things like that
that 's true .
enjoyed our talk
get back to what you 're doing
'll and
talking with you too
a lot of
some every now and then
i work
my wife 's home during the day and
so she doing most of it usually end up .
single we used to always cook , when the house around .
you do
really like ,
there is a few dishes ,
so we , have definitely different tastes
you have different stuff
is a pretty bad cook
are pretty bad
my husband 's really good ,
he put himself through college working in restaurants .
much better cook than
still so when a lot
about a year and a half ago
so , was one of the things he took over
the kids and
they 're really happy
is they
dad cook mom
him do it
but so do you 've kids ?
obviously you have one .
two ,
you have two .
one 's nine months
's two and a half and
two and half
was just going to say
not yet at that stage
it does .
get
she makes different meals six ,
like to have one thing ,
one , the like
could n't
could n't do that ,
but
me think
the one recipe
was the thing that always turned out the best for us something we thought looked really fancy , but was real easy ,
what is that .
it has a french name ,
you over rice and
what is that ,
ca n't even remember what the recipe 's name is anymore ,
sort of
it really good
so we have a lot of seafood before we moved down here .
and that sounds delicious .
that sounds great .
we 're just thinking of having party , a dinner .
we went to this dinner party on the other night , was kind of like a game
they have a murder mystery ,
as one of the characters
and you have to solve the mystery during the dinner ,
it was really fun and
so we were going to try doing ourselves , and
that kind of and
and then can make ahead
that is another thing
have a problem with my wife ,
she does n't like the dishes beef .
the chicken and fishing
we always ate beef and pork a lot , and
, known
my husband did too .
they made a lot of meat at the table and sure they have always .
meat
plenty of red good meat
my dad could eat , a meal out with any vegetables at all .
my dad would n't know what to do .
that
that 's just part of it .
always my husband , but did
there was
that there were several things
but it was never
it is
so he had put up with it .
but there was one thing that he could n't stand
that was soybeans and .
tried it once or twice
he could eat it , and not just
was
it 's hard
that 's true .
, like every now and then for a change
it 's nice .
some of the stuff , is good
a tremendous amount of
we have little kids at the time , and
was home with them
do n't
is not really that great at it and
just so it turned out .
your little one there
he is done all .
are he
down set
or , do you get into that
we used to do that ,
and that would be it .
be
, known
can do a pretty good pie , and
we have this in our family my grandmother gave my mother recipe crust pie
my mother and taught me how to make .
a pretty mean pie
but do n't
we have the same kind of problem .
save you money
three times the amount of
it so good
you ever seen
, ca n't remember what it 's called
out just
have
but never have done it
.
that sounds pretty good .
a portion of it
to it all these other ingredients
you make the bread and then
or you save a portion of it for the next time or something
and you give it to someone else
and that 's how they continue .
do n't know how safe that was
it sounded too strange to me ,
that 's true ,
is that
'll talk later to you
by the way ,
where
it sounds so close .
we 've got a good connection ,
is
people outside
they are trying to get all different amount of people .
that is where we went .
you did ,
right here , right up in outside
we 'd like to get back over to the east coast ,
'll tell you
it 's nice over there .
it 's sort of funny ,
things doing pretty good down here
you could n't get a job to save yourself over there
of years a
we were saying we could sell here our house and buy one down there
cash .
you could probably ,
you could probably ,
it 's good talking to you .
to you too .
take care .
what do you think about it ?
definitely change in the last generation or so
a lot of it do with women working
, too , .
all women going to work
they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby ,
that will be it , but
you just continue right on with your work
it 's really coming because most women days now can afford the time that they could take unless the company pay them off not to that .
they to take off ca n't afford to have even what seem like children .
for you can you really have it and make how many
if , because you 're , just working to pay for care days ,
two or three
did n't have to work
that 's good .
did n't work ,
but did n't
she had just her fourth one in march
she and do n't have to work either .
do n't
do n't
we do n't have obviously any
that is part of the role reversal
society for such a long time said
now you need have your family
two people were a family
you ca n't afford to have over two hardly if you 're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff
and it 's hard with two ,
, have two
, have a son and a daughter
if it would come from
i work , now
i work full time
it takes just about everything you got just when .
help out that
still , but it cost a lot .
just the cost of living
loans and do n't pay for groceries and stuff .
cars and all their books and
the books outrageous absolutely outrageous
, known
known
and they are getting worse .
my daughter brought a book that she was going to have for one of her classes next to have the other day home
is it
but it is getting worse ,
'd have probably of three or four children
is it not always
would probably in essence , but you
have to work
in a real good living and everything , in order for me
getting , when you have one child that is it ,
you work
you work , and
two or three kids way , by the ,
is it just and
there is n't going to be any of this ,
ever very few people will stay home .
do n't want to stay
would just go long nuts sitting at home all day
the time ,
i work all week and
and ca n't
did do
at the age that she is at now
go through college
you spend the rest of your life with
but it 's so far down the road ,
that 's what you did .
you got and then
and then you have a family .
that 's just the way it was .
and the woman took care of them ,
like the way
and so it 's not so hard for people ,
three or so years
you do n't have , and
it is
nobody do .
a lot of the kids
it 's real small town ,
and they ca n't imagine why we would want to have children .
everybody have kids
it 's your turn .
was coming
out of high school
got out of high school ,
and did n't have kids for four and a half years
because but that was
was n't ready for kids and
think that 's what it is ,
is not either
what 's the matter with her , and everybody thought .
they are going , i bet she ca n't get pregnant probably
they thought it was terrible ,
just that you get better , but now ready
you just do n't get ready .
was kind of odd because as a general rule
was just not ready for kids and
wanted to get out , and work a little bit
and wanted to travel and stuff like that , which we did
and kids , did n't fit in right then
but , it is getting more and more like that where there are more and more couples
do n't care what anybody tells you
more and more the attitude is
because that are like my daughter
maybe she might want a child then when
'd like to have grandchildren
finally she told me
but it took every nerve in her body .
and she raised her kids
was and
, do n't know
because my mother have six girls ,
and she worked too .
was when she stayed home
and it was rough ,
it was hard ,
and it 's really ,
, known
just like now there are so much more now
all my income , goes for things like luxuries
my daughter , put her through college and stuff to
the rest of it we just buy things like boats , but
trips on
or the less like stuff entertainment
that though
because we 're just a age , now have
is not old
's older , but
really wanted to do ,
now could go back and do it , but not
, could n't really
could stay home all the time and do nothing
did stuff and
but , it to me feel
just that the new way
think so .
care day where the children were in the facility but not there
more and more of them
know if it is up there
but they are getting care days .
are
even if you have two kids if you have four kids , you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go
more and more of our hospitals , especially , over getting them
some of the bigger companies and then
but it 's the mainly hospitals .
it , nobody around here , do
it is too small around here .
are pretty gun pro control over all
has a lot of arguments with people about the issue of control gun
debate with people about it and .
one of a two in terms
do n't like the idea of people being able to kill with very little effort
of them having power over me that very
i hope you 're ready for this .
'll give it a try
was raised guns , hunting around
so do n't have a fear of fire arms in any respect
them and what their capabilities
it 's pretty is n't it ?
and go here
that apply to anything as well as guns .
any of the big cities you 've got the different rival gangs
and they 're going to fight with them .
if they 'll get it .
they 'll get it
and they 'll get across the border .
of a restriction on it that
if they want to run a check on me background .
if they want to put a waiting period seven days again .
personal making a trust
this guy is
if he had an automatic weapon that he could be really raising some problems and
you are just
you just told me you 're going to get one of those guns anyway .
your control border points
the border one way
so why any had restrictions at all ?
one , being , gun full control , ten being none
'd said about an eight
your state police or your police county for you be
that makes a lot of to me since .
certainly feel that we may disagree on when someone should owned a fire arm
if someone owns that a fire
the car in the hands of the wrong person can be as deadly , just as the weapon as a pistol .
have a bicycle
have been run off the road and all sorts of things
is still
what 's the argument ,
the bad guys going to have guns anyway
the bad guys going
they 're not going to take those courses .
it is a way of raising the prices of illegal guns ?
if are not going to cut it it must
that does mean advantage ?
not necessarily a thing prices
a l area ?
bay area
you have been to the city ?
all these people come around , and
are out with my family
gone
we get in the car
this guy comes , up
can now pull a gun on him
and when you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change .
what if you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon ?
then it is still .
before they 'll get the gun on me .
and how to use them effectively and everything
in this sort of wild west scenario , you 're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns just given quickly human nature .
it 's more of a police action in itself ,
if you got to go through a course certification also know and then this guy 's pretty good with it
that is another trip ,
even more when it comes to my wife and son .
wo n't even blink ,
, known
.
and you make a mistake
this is where the question of control gun come in .
that was the topic .
what , is considered i gun control .
all of a sudden my combat in me up
go ahead
doubt and so that he is now got
feel comfortable doing
do n't miss if
the kind of
do n't
the sentencing go to the judge instead of the jury
was waiting for them
and do n't know that 's not a good idea
that 's not a bad idea
they need change somehow , probably ,
the whole system needs change ,
have just got too many people in there
.
and it is another form of sentencing .
it should be a unanimous decision on that one thing ,
.
it be majority vote
and that 's not going to be good .
do n't like that ,
do n't like that at all
but it was a conviction drug
and do n't remember
had some cocaine
exactly how much and he had
, but not actually selling it
there is a difference ,
and , he was a courier .
and he sat on that jury
they found guilty him , and
and they went through
and they were told during the trial that this is this guy 's first offense
and he is
it 's time
and it was time to do this drug thing
let 's crackdown and
with the judge and with the two other lawyers
however , they could not tell that the jury during the trial because were all three of them in appeal .
so , the jury did n't know about it ,
that this was this guy 's first offense ,
but it 's just horrible , since it was first offense ,
before three times
and the jury was very upset
and my husband , come home , very upset
i wonder if a judge did n't have control of that if some of that would change .
the judge might know
or at least it would n't hurt to switch over there and to see if it worked any better ,
we can if it did n't come back for something else
that 's true .
that 's very true .
we need a change in the system definitely
we are doing not working
it 's not working , too .
it 's just piling up on us .
being in any way , shape or form rehabilitated
and they are either
or it is a matter of a few months when
and they 're going to be right back for the same thing
we 're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes ,
that 's very true .
mine about this the other day
the people in those countries and on our money to survive
but really believe
pull our aid from these other countries
so , and maybe
so tell them , you 've got five years .
we funding for the next two years you
by then you should all have worked .
and then we will have the money if we would do that because we 've got some serious problems here to work
are we and
very serious
is it working , not just
you 're right .
for them
is they
is they
got kids here in
and do n't know
heal when you 're sick yourself so , the world
bet .
we agree on the jury thing
but , we 'll need an unanimous verdict
the judge have a opportunity to make , a decision
should we
if it does n't work , we can always come back ,
think , but it would be a good idea to try it
, too , .
so , all anyway .
good .
good hear you from .
too you
you do have any pets ?
we got two cats .
two cats .
have until my mom developed an allergies , up the whole time
are used to having around cats , so
like
around in general
dogs i favor over cats
is not a person dog at all
is a person dog
when he was a kid it depends on what you have
probably ,
was a kid , in fact ,
, still may be
cats , but
sometimes wonder .
but we house sat for my wife 's boss a couple weeks ago
and he has a dog and everything ,
everything we were the dog sitting and
felt and just miserable all weekend
you are still
it was that could be it .
what you got to take them for walk
pay a lot
to pay attention
but it is not quite the same thing .
that 's true .
you do n't have to let them outside cats ,
indoor cats
.
it 's a pain to clean
have all the time when
it was terrible really .
's garbage bags ,
that sounds so easy ,
, did
in there
take it out
that 's it , and .
was what we used and what to do
and the whole thing to the garbage
same idea
or two days
?
and so it was n't so bad .
.
and cats as easy just two
it just never started
all of her animals she had ever
she 's got dog now one and two the cats
there are basically
and somebody wanted him
was and to mature not enough to keep the dog , did n't realize how much work it was just
and she is
my husband nixed completely the idea of having a dog or a cat
there are because that 's all to it .
so , you know ,
so , you do n't have anything right now
we do n't have anything right now .
the kid ,
now that we have a kid
but he was completely against having a dog or cat ,
he said they are working as much as a kid ,
and they are harder to get rid of for the weekend , .
leave them for a weekend , as long as
not really and it 's a big deal ,
they are happier when we 're around
pretty much by themselves
and we could n't do that with a dog .
that 's really true .
other friends of mine , but have
they have four of them ,
and like that
if , they get really upset ,
trouble around the house and things like that and .
one within a short very amount of time and that killed
but they are not that much fun ,
ca n't take for a walk you ,
you ca n't ,
they ca n't
they ca n't do anything ,
was a kid
my brother had
,
'll never forget that
because , he come home
he counted and the fishing
one of the fishing were missing and
they could n't
it was
did n't see
trying
a dog for
and do n't know if we got rid of the dog
my brother was
asthma my brother had
but because of that we did n't
then he had and fish .
not the most exciting
, do n't know
everything they are pretty and
but just have never seen the attraction of having fishing
it 's not fun as much .
, had an eel
an eel ?
forget what type of fishing it was ,
it was one of these fishing that it ate a big fishing and things like that other .
now we really get sick .
could n't see having fishing like that
really , really pretty
cats n't
is this .
what did they
come around
a cat will do the same trick .
see 's
, had a pet rat , for
and it was a live rat ,
this woman while offered and it just to me
and actually , she was
a pet rat for
how she got it ,
but it was the same kind of a deal
did this work
had a rat mill
the people in the lab one day in my friend called
think he is sick ,
do n't think he is sick ,
think she is pregnant ,
asked me if she and so
and took the baby
when she was little this tiniest thing , half the price of a mouse just like , got and her
had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand
and then she grew to be pretty big
do n't
had and her for over two years
and she was
she would crawl on me
would much more than you think .
go , kind of nuts
my favorite animals in the world
could see getting one from birth and everything , but
have one too
because it stayed in its cage to have little
and was easy to take it
me the same thing and .
they can be
it actually was more fun than you would think .
it 's not a dog ,
people
walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them
it 's really kind of funny .
that law remember hearing all about it
if they had any special law for the horses in central park
n't
of course , .
they have the bags behind them
they 're actually
hit the bags
the smell is just so bad , of the horses .
, have n't been up there
probably was n't that bad
is not long that
it was times , twelve of the year .
this past not fall
was up there , and at center park
and used to go up and visit her
that 's not too far
you have two cats , you said
breed cats or anything ,
they are just mutts ,
this was before we even met and .
's she had them for a couple years
and they 're really
they are sisters ,
one of them are a lot bigger than the one other
the one other away from the food and .
apparently do n't know all the details
they are both females ?
see 's
it 's not so much more
all kinds of sports
me
really
is not really creative too
up to my mom
will become
you employed by that craft for too long
think about it
getting good at reading rather
what kind of time frame 's it looking for the different shifts up there ?
who know
is sure
twenty percent and would be thirty one .
how about that
that are possible .
how about that
that 's unfortunate
you in the defense
it is in the area many other corporations ?
they 're hiring all
apple 's coming
that has some opportunities and
how about that
a slow painful death
the computer operations or in the actual manufacturing ?
is a worker defense
's , government tool
are
or
exempt .
for myself , unfortunately , it was
there was no incentive for myself to leave ,
but it was just an opportunity
and decided to take it .
so , you did n't even get the severance package .
should have taken the , option when that was there ,
missed it by a couple months
but what one can do .
are happy just to still have a job
you doing now
's kind of happy with it ,
it is getting better all the time ,
knew
was in the computer operations
all starts to become
there are benefits
and there are things that was n't as good ,
'd say , but as an overall package
it been a long time
shaken by the situation
, which is the one thing is in your favor least
is not really worried
that 's great .
that 's good .
and seem rather happy about it most of the time , known , just what might happen
it is sometimes good to have just everything out on the table .
in all , but it still feels funny .
a blessing in
actually , the positions they found outside of the company was much , much better than the ones that they currently have inside .
so ca n't seem to get into it right now
'll be here in six months
you would like to be there ?
all things being equal
somewhere , or even
that whole area is actually quite nice .
that is a beautiful place .
that 's just fantastic down there .
this is
you want to live ,
that spot and then once pick out , you pick out .
that 's the problem .
and now feel
it takes a bit of it a shift does n't .
had job offers
but never found the one who was worth it
the best thing about it is can you try something
you do n't like it
at the whole thing here
'll take
five years
there is a noticeable difference there .
momentum uh are driving force in our lives .
are looking
that 's good ,
you 've got a good attitude about it .
and is looking at it as a change
is looking at it as an adventure and
go there .
that 's the way to do it .
go there
that 's the thing to do .
about we
that will work out just fine .
to you .
to you .
this is an appropriate topic the day after days earth , so
think is the main pollutants in the air ?
have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that
so much they put off
and they are not regulated enough .
that is too me .
and are not sure about yesterday ,
we did n't really watch it too much yesterday ,
affecting the earth and things by
and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot ,
as our increases population and our number of cars increase per the population , that is that the problem and actually
but like you also said the industry pollution
and their regulation is placed on them it is better than it used to be
the amount of
ca n't stand that
it is incredible .
dumping , that things
is , if they are getting away with it
ca n't imagine plants ,
also they and then there
that can damage the earth
in
just .
at this plant
a lot of research
a lot of
the east
we 've got imperial sugar
and they have been there for years .
think about it
is not really sure
would think that it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down stream , but
or you can
but it 's going to move a lot of off that when .
know that ,
worry every then now
we 're still on a water well ,
we 're not on water city ,
is not sure ,
ca n't remember the name of the county
is not sure ,
, known
know we have a piece property there ,
so , they have a lot of cattle in the area ,
have them to be able to milk them there
is that it is going through ,
their natural water ,
but it is below the surface
it 's not very far down ,
their water in that town within a certain amount of years , will
it will .
and they were talking cows thousands in little tiny one area .
well .
cows fed well
.
so that it 's a problem , not just
they 've got a real big problem , but when
they have so much rain in the past few years
that 's bad .
, and is just
but do n't know
if it 's really going to be a problem for the earth
the rain forest , and all
not me
of the trees down here a
, is no
, will take longer just to grow back and it
that where we ca n't synthesize it
it 's just so much better .
so
, known
things done now
, do n't know personally
the emission controls on them that they have nowadays
really started as far as the environment
it 's really becoming a problem .
we going to have
we going to have for the environment
would get this subject today because our yesterday dog ran away just
and it 's just been tearing up all day me .
i bet
just because we 've been looking over all for him .
we 've been to the pound ,
the adoption
we 've been all over the neighborhood , just
we have been calling neighbors .
this is really strange just so .
so guess .
have him before ?
this is the first time .
he 's gotten out before ,
but he is
he is gone never away .
what kind of a dog is he ?
always .
and
he is a big one .
he is pretty big .
said he is gone away never like this before ,
by a car or something
because he 's big so that easily
but do n't know
i hope he come back ,
that is too bad .
, too
have long
about two years
that 's tough .
to animals
is n't
they are there for you always
and they do n't talk back to you .
and it is
they are companions ,
you do have any ?
we have a cat , a white cat and .
how do they get along together ?
pretty good
we have the dog , first
and she is
and the cat kind of rules ,
but she like him .
we have another cat about two years ago .
have so
we got this new cat and then ,
have children two
really the animals and .
elderly very lives with my mother and then
and she is really good friends with the dog .
they are very , good buddies .
is that
said they are really companions ,
and they 're friends .
that 's right .
you can
right back and they
that 's right .
they do n't
, just unconditionally
known
it is
it is
, do n't know
this is just so hard .
know
it is
we have him for two years
he 's gotten out ,
but he is always been right there .
he 's never been at all gone
he is just always been right there when he gets out .
it is the first time he is ever been like this gone .
that 's really too bad ,
that 's awful ,
just knew we looked at the pound , and we just , went all over the place today
knew we were going to find , and
it was , and when we did n't .
so do n't know
hope you 'll find him
most likely you will .
.
have you put any posters up or anything like that ?
about that tonight since he got out just yesterday
we were trying to find some pictures of him recently .
but we just do n't have a whole lot .
we have on film on the video camera him .
you ca n't sure .
, so do n't know
we will put up some posters and stuff .
that 's good .
hopefully and that will help maybe the neighborhood around .
living in this neighborhood
they can keep open their eyes ,
that will help .
think he 'll come back if he gets out
really , because he knows exactly where he lives ,
he will .
i bet he does .
known , that it 's hard on you
'd too
known
would get this kind of a call
is n't it , though ?
, known
it 's very strange
out all night
really when he 's not right at the door in the morning and worry
but is always he came back eventually
that 's good .
that is one thing about cats , though
they are so small
and they can get hurt easier a lot .
they can get hurt easier a lot ,
they can .
worry if they are not right there
but he 's a real feisty guy .
because he does n't want them on our property .
is that right ?
they really do not just want on their property other animals .
any cat that comes near and even a dog he wo n't jump at them or anything ,
but he 'll sit
and he 'll watch ,
and maybe if came , he would
but he is
really do n't know that because my mother , never liked them well cats
never had them growing up so ,
around me had never really them ,
they really is a lot different than dogs because they are very independent ,
when he , want to be very
and he does n't want to be
but he is when he wants to be
but if he is not in the mood , you 'd better stay away from him .
dogs be in the mood always
that 's true .
they come up
underneath your hand
most dogs and .
.
do n't
they know exactly how to get that attention ,
sure .
they just come , up
against you
he 's outside during the day
we do bring him in
the backyard , it be stuff and in for him to run too .
, is that he had all this room to run in
how he did get out ?
he dug a hole under the fence .
did it a couple weeks ago
put him back in there
he did it again
chained so we
but we did n't really
and then we put so that he could n't get out
he kind of ripped through the chicken wire .
do n't understand because it is , like , he 's got a good home ,
just a lot love
it 's like we ca n't understand why he kept wanting to get out ,
we could n't just ,
that , animals
and see what 's going on they .
that is probably true
do n't think it is anything we did
hope not .
, known
he really do have a good home .
your kids handling it
do n't
, have two girls
, do n't know
seemed they at first ,
, it is , if he does n't come home can
that sounds like kids .
it , is , wait .
poor buddy
said he is only been gone a day
already and you want to replace him .
what is his name ,
buddy .
buddy ?
that was our cat 's name who died .
is that right ?
buddy after
that 's funny .
but , he was a good cat , too .
a lot
just felt so bad , and
it 's real contagious
and it runs rampant in this area , said the vet
did n't know that
they get if the cat other had it
had no idea
did not know that
just felt terrible
could never justify owning a personal computer at home ,
that 's an quite expense to look for ,
who 's this ,
that 's a good question actually .
my wife works out of our home .
she has an office
in fact she sit in the office and
now .
a very regular use of
is a computer scientist
and write programs to do little things
actually is working at home just to keep track of things
.
so learned to repair one
never really learned to operate one
that 's a key thing .
there are really two issues to that that there are so many software packages available today .
they have in other words when someone built that packet software
if they were careful , they could make totally without understanding how the computer work , but the use of it .
the nail on
for the average person 's for it exactly he can use .
whatever
your issue , then be there really
space , is a handicap with me
living in a motor home .
that
's and
that
and are not
another year and a half
they getting cheap quite
but just like .
running , four hundred dollars
the calculators
calculators
sure .
actually was thinking about upgrading and kind of look at the whole spectrum mine very recently
you can buy a whole new computer brand not a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars actually
including a printer ?
actually was n't including a printer ,
but you can buy now for a hundred dollars a printer
make seven hundred so it
a hundred ?
a respectable one ?
do n't keep track of prices on them ,
but that does amaze me .
had the prices
the monitoring with the card that drives is another hundred
is that you 're not now buying brands ,
the way to do it if you really wanted to buy probably is that there is a computer call shopper magazine
it 's a big magazine ,
and it 's probably an inch thick a thousand pages
but the magazine is full of these mail-order computer houses
and they are all competing with each .
and you mix
by it and then .
but there is no real brands
making those mother boards , the main computer , the board circuit
.
how do you go about getting one of those catalogs ?
it is large although it is a magazine
about an inch
'll tell you ,
do n't
they up with ten
that 's right .
there are great .
that 's my favorite jokes one ever anyway .
one and one equal ten .
that 's great .
it is kind of an joke inside .
,
that 's great ,
that 's a good joke .
did for years
and then was a scientist over central research labs in
my job to actually do some of the marketing changed
i type
but do n't use it anymore
in connection with my work .
track of an inventory here
that is where a computer is very handy and of course .
.
are that equipment
that
that 's fascinating .
our equipment be in top condition
and they are
have to keep up with them , so
and it 's very handy on the computer doing it .
it is handy .
have very little interest in computers and up .
they but .
certainly .
see 's
kind of
think we did
little nice conversation with
good day .
good luck to you
thank you .
same to you
do n't
known or not ,
've got some opinions on it , but
to go ahead .
those type of that people have the most opinions .
had teenagers
and now have
and do n't know it might do a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective them
gone far too far
the young people and .
think that it would n't hurt them to step back slightly just and see and
that 's true .
nothing about the peace
either
went to college
are out on a limb here , and
college volunteer work for
have you ever heard about that one ?
, have n't
a twin
they do n't pay as much
you do n't need as much as far as to live in a small town
to form her college education
one year
but she got credits for it ?
that 's very interesting .
some group paid part of his income college
or something like that
think that 's a good way for people to get people to come back to these small towns to work maybe
think that 's an excellent program ,
really .
like
as far as getting doctors and all that stuff ,
some really major health problem
it would n't be convenient ,
but we could find one .
so can see the advantage to that one
, itself is n't it
really do n't know that much about it ,
it is still in existence .
into other countries and stuff
farm up , their schools
and
you 're right ,
think it 's a sixties program
that was his big deal .
you do n't have all the money
my grandchildren single out
, had seen from other people 's children and grandchildren
n't really bad that
think at the same time , but it would do them a world of good
do n't know you could require to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that everyone ,
just like
they could buy their way out .
is in anything else
they 'd figure a way around in a heartbeat that one .
if there is another issue here ,
and maybe this is
this was n't and the question
they can go in there
and it does n't do any good .
do n't know it does
we are losing certain , races of people .
, but can remember what it was never
because their society , is n't there anymore
their belief system and all the structures of their society gone , essentially
and they 're just kind of more like a side than anything else show
that 's and sad .
, could go in those people and rescue
really an effective tool , is
good
we 've got enough without a passport
there are plenty .
about our own species
do some kind of work type community service and help people in that area or people in the united states
have been out , and
but wonder if
probably
going to go into social work and stuff
be bad for everybody not to do something and realize that it is everybody 's responsibility to help these people , half
is not just saying
the last thing
that 's what my father-in-law , were talking about
these people money
who was it
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need give more money to these people ,
, it on booze they 'll go out and spend just
exactly is that it .
a way out dry
be realistic
that 's not just realistic .
or to find
getting , here
we 're not .
i think , that is realistic more than making them go in the peace corps .
think that 's a lot more realistic
think we should be spending more time
we 've got plenty ,
in fact , we 've got far too many .
you 're in mound flower ?
mound
was going to ask you
had return something
, but ca n't decide
mostly it is
had return that many things
having a problem with right now
are
it 's a pretty good topic actually for me .
so , we 'll talk about that some .
we could talk about that ,
they longer last or something like that
let just a little bit about myself
have for the last four or five years , but
have two cornea transplants
is no fun anymore
can imagine
ca n't see ,
and it 's hard
you ca n't read labels
thought just
go there .
it 'll come ,
are
thought .
we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project ,
and we asked them details on it
because we bought a not brand name .
we call up , and
they were very happy with the system , and
and they felt they 've got a good price .
we went and , in
we explained what we needed
and
so we went , and there
we told them about the stuff
and the guy said the computer would fit our needs .
these things wo n't probably make any sense to you
but he told us we need positions to put our own equipment in the computer user .
it 's called a user boards and
or is slots what it 's called .
size cards and in there
we , said , and so great
we 'll buy ,
in our order
a week and later went back , and we picked up the computer .
and we tried to put our own board in it
and there is only one slot we could put in it .
at one board and only we have
so it was n't so bad
so we used it a bit ,
but we tried to figure out whether we could put in three because we really need be able to put in at least three .
the computer was supposed to have two .
it has them
but the problem is that you ca n't put the type of card we need put in it , in it .
.
they told us there would be no problem because the salesman just do n't really know .
.
it has more to do with the people who sold it in some ways .
probably they did n't
that 's completely it .
the salesman did n't know .
so , we went back in ,
they did so that .
and we said
and they were doing it at their own costs .
and so we , said .
and we went back
and then we get ,
my husband goes to pick up last week it
, had just the baby
's life and
and get it , bring it home ,
first they are missing components of it like cables of all
you ca n't really so test it out .
and then second thing , we still ca n't
and now we are dealing with having to bring back again it
hope and so
it 's really .
you know , it are just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on
so much time and goes
think that 's the worst part
put it on a gold credit card
the credit card company
and you do n't have yet to pay for it they said .
, that is n't it
it 's really .
for credit said
for credit said
think that 's really important and
these guys if they give us a hard time we 're going to say , you , look ,
if you ca n't fix this to our satisfaction , we 're just returning the computer .
that 's right .
that 's right .
pay , even though the charge
that 's right .
but they 'll just undo the credit that they did to them .
they will ,
that 's right .
they will ,
they will put the kind of clout on them that you ca n't really do .
she and so does n't remember anything
music and some of these things but .
the first time
was chewed up in the , thing and
then after that , you could n't so
says she and
so and you ca n't get it either to run the right way
what brand is it ?
you do know ?
could tell you
really do n't know which brand it is
was but
in our case where we knew we were buying a copy
think this is a brand name maybe
suspect that it 's probably , just a fluke and
have the papers and everything
and we 're going to take back just it
you do at some major store buy it ?
chain up here .
do n't they ?
this was a regular electronics store .
so do n't think there will be too much problem
not as well
a lot of things
do n't you ?
of course , it 's hard to think of an exact example ,
that 's good
like electronic stuff
their , working
as well as they could be
think that 's right
of years a
they may cost a little more ,
but they do n't have to take them to the shop every other day .
loved and it
it did a good job ,
so , part of it is that we need develop more of a pride in .
and go up clear
just the people do n't care about
nobody 's , paying really
just so get me my dollar
give me my paycheck , so can
are doing what
think that are too bad
and too because it 's a shame .
there is n't enough .
a good job
so what you 're paid be enough .
research
and get done so
satisfaction out of it and .
that 's right ,
the company
you 're
you 'll be the first one fired , so
you do your day 's work
we do n't really and
when you 've got that type of attitude on it , the people do n't care , about their work .
basically probably it goes right back .
without any pay there is just in working for itself value
just in whatever you little value
the value is in doing well it
doing a good job of it
the question were about physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise .
do it , as much as
try to walk
did it every day , and
is so and
a regular so much better and so much
.
but it 's just get motivated to do it ,
once every night , and .
ago started again and
was walking , and
and it got
was by myself , and
so i kind of
i that kind of use
is starting earlier ,
have n't
it is easy to find an excuse to exercise not always .
known
it is sure .
it is sure .
about how you ?
do you exercise on a regular basis ?
to try .
of this year the
is
is going to be real good ,
and for two months at a time they run .
you do and
signed up for one who were three nights a week , an hour and a half , and
that was so four and a half hours a week .
and are not cheap ,
spent that much money
a friend of mine
was so real good ,
missed it only about three times
then , and come around march
signed up again , and
got out of class
and that was so
tell , and what
have been terrible ever since then
you do n't get back into it
because
a bunch of teachers and have an aerobics class last year .
went in together and hired we ,
she came to our school and twice a week .
, would go faithfully
and then once .
went back again , a couple times and missed another timing
you 've just to stick with it
this session and is about to run out .
is getting as far as teaching a lot of training classes kind of into a real busy schedule
me go out of town
just kind of on doing that and throw my whole schedule
could have gone
but this week 's
could have gone tonight ,
and did n't
it is this kind of the last week and is now
'll start fresh next week just
better it but .
another thing is my friend that were taking the first two months with me was n't the second two months
she started taking lessons tennis ,
that extra motivation , of us encourage to go
when you have somebody to go with and to do the same thing that makes a difference .
misery company
do n't really love exercise
the neighbor across the street , she belong ,
and it 's not 's president any more .
do n't know what is the name of it anymore
but she love it .
for her an automatic
she enjoy it just so much .
n't and
is the same way
good after
are doing it
do n't enjoy it at all ,
and she just love it .
even when she does n't go to the health club , she run .
and , it 's a thing for her daily .
and it 's so hard for me .
envy her
could be that way ,
, too , .
older who loves running too
she and run all the time ,
do n't run in fact
run
a radio or something
that pass the time
are walking
living in my apartment complex in this neighborhood
we used to try to get together , and
is going to start doing it again
there is a nice residential real area right behind our apartment complex .
and it is
that 's right .
you can kind of talk , and
and it makes it pass pretty quickly ,
the aerobics and are n't too boring .
are doing it
could do some other i things
do have to make myself to go , but
feel and , of
feel and after
it is great afterwards ,
can go in there ,
'll make myself to go , and
'll have , and
and get out ,
do n't have any more a headache
feel ,
how much better
better in general and then just
that 's right .
feel and just
have been kind of dragging the last few weeks ,
'd feel better
it does ,
it gives you energy .
is
or have a headache
, just got over the flu
better not so go .
it is kind of it a vicious circle is n't ?
it 's really .
more exercise when energy
it 's not to silly , and
, but do n't know
it 's just a put off .
, do n't do more
know and
now , is exercise
there is no reason that we should n't do it ,
but do n't know
it 's hard to make yourself go just .
do n't like about aerobics
for just two nights the
it is less expensive .
that 's good , too .
would talk myself out of going , probably more if it were too cheap
think , you , spent much money that since
you 'd go better .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
have a right facility
it is right there ,
they 've got two different aerobics rooms ,
you do n't
private instructors and then ?
that 's great .
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms ,
and it 's a pretty nice setup .
and of course it is real convenient , because it is right there at work
have come home and then go
go straight from my desk over
can see that would be easy
they make it easy as as they can possibly for you .
do a lot people take of advantage of it ?
quite a
lunch hour
i guess guys and can take advantage of that .
do an hour of aerobics
is that one but
they have second shift and things like that even .
they have so big variety .
they have some aerobics water even when the weather got nice out in the pool .
never have done one that before
you have a pool there , too ?
nice how
it 's a real nice facility .
it 's got a full inside basketball court , also
on building a track jogging , and some other things
but it 's very nice .
that 's great .
advantage of it as much
is just starting to do the thing aerobics finally
or in the weight
do you have to pay for that
you can get a membership that allows you to use the facilities , fitness
and it 's about eight dollars a month .
that 's not bad .
at all .
pretty cheap .
the cost aerobics extra even if you have the fitness membership , and then
the aerobics classes
think so too
people of all ages and take advantage of the aerobics ?
people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics ?
the topic , was should the united states adopt the metric system
how they should do it ?
why it did n't
last time
are all for it
is too
i guess , and they tried soft conversion and hard conversion
one them is where you just take of
direct conversion
do n't know
people if they have and
,
written on there
figures it
that 's the problem .
so you can figure out what you 're actually paying for it .
, do n't know
we were talking metric system in school when .
at first , not
but by the time was
expect people with any kind of buying power under the age of thirty or so
maybe is where the problem came in
it is kind of like learning a language ,
in this conversion thing you always end up all the time when
course this country , is n't a dictatorship
thing is that it 's a global market place these days ,
something .
do n't remember what is the one other
it 's just for us to go over time .
we 're all around the world ,
you have to perform this conversion anyway .
, too
you end with in parts of inches , half , fourth this sort of thing things up with any drawing system .
some of them and then .
they went down the line somewhere
your designs but up .
can imagine
use metric
down there , because they did n't understand else
if you start talking , they 'd look at you like , what .
had a little bit of experience with it , so
this funny looking coke
's , but not as big
a strange looking
but she gets
if it is between zero and ten , it 's cold ,
and it 's not too bad , if it is ten and twenty
it 's pretty warm , if it is between twenty and thirty
it is getting warm .
having between a hundred or what , thirty , four zero thirty degrees , who is that the resolution
you do n't get all the little differences
about to be twice as much
five .
as many points
something like .
we have to learn to think that way
is on metric
for the most part think so .
into some problems
a standards and stuff s
he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work .
he just get .
but the threads , was different
and it was a total mess .
that would be a mess .
but it 's got the hardest combination of metric
most of the body parts be metric
s a e , and
it 's just crazy .
it just got bad ,
you got to have one , and not mix them up .
because you 're going to get to one system if you got a mix still never .
of course , here that would involve changing signs road all across the country , and
per hour , and the whole yards nine
kind of gradually hard to do .
and you know
you 'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour .
you 'd have people going a hundred miles an hour .
, do n't know
but it is almost eight kilometers hundred .
sure that seem like a long way .
is that it
every road
just about metric
you got still on the road to do n't have cars .
that not all common
now cars , they have both .
putting so people start thinking that way
in kilometers
because anything was the old zone canal , is going to be miles per hour
start .
right now they 've got off of the main highway kind of a central location ,
some kind of
which we are supposed to put all our week 's garbage into it ,
and of course it does n't fit right now .
in may , but now , we breaking down it
and they 're picking up it all .
we have to separate our papers and our glass , and
they have one day for everything you picked up from your yard , and then
that we put , and
so it 's really great .
is completely for it ,
it is
that 's good .
apparently a lot of people and favorably responded to it , because they are going to do it
it 's going to be ,
of months the next
have never
have a whole lot
most of the things we have
they do have any place where you can put your pop cans and things like that down in the cafeteria ?
there is only one pop machine
it 's not accessible to the cafeteria now , and
is so mainly juice and coffee and tea
so you do n't have much choice there .
not really .
so it is getting people .
and they brought down to the shelters it .
for cans for people have
they have the time cards
and it works great .
the machines snack
that 's good .
is they really so
they make some changes and
it work its way back into the soil
saw part of that
it was good .
, to save the water and to put it on my plants
started years ago , i guess ,
not years ago ,
but
would say five years ago ,
did n't realize that was the biggest waste of water , but
that was
missed question , really bad totally that
, is trying to think
did n't
ca n't remember who was my score ,
but did
was
that was a shocker to me .
a lot of
is that
you think more should be done or something else
why they could n't do with those more recycling .
is that there are recycled paper in there ,
and it cost more than regular paper .
through the expense of recycling
people buying it
so the cost of it is higher .
adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing ,
the regular fertilizers and things you buy , but is the cost
there 's a good reason for the environment
but is the cost
that 's recycling ,
'd like to see
so that people would use this stuff over again .
it 's a good idea .
but lots of times you do n't even see the signs on the bottles .
and if we 're going to really do , they ought to put out bigger for people to see that stuff
that is hard when you 're in a grocery store and you are short anyway .
enough to ask somebody to take nerve
you have n't got nerve enough to say put it back ,
stranger heard
they do n't break down very easily , and apparently
or contracts when
is this kind of an unusual use for that type of thing and .
, known
the old ones ?
there is great in
's good and
, and then saw recycling
hoses , were being used
else ,
out of old tires
remember what it was
ca n't think of it now
see different things that we could come but
the bags out of the store , buy bring the back
and bring them in the store
is going back out to my car to pick up forever
did n't really
the more they 'll do
how serious the problem is
see a little more
do n't have any tiny little kids ,
saving it now , in five years , when they get bigger if it 'll work a little bit more , too , but
do it right now
can keep my own garbage
, might not have that much
.
,
you at work right now
is so
building in which ?
you summit
this is fun .
what building
is building one
is building two
we found at least something different .
had a call
not like that
have neither
is n't ?
the last time
that 's funny .
that 's funny .
building so two ?
the weather in two building 's cold
it 's been cold .
it 's been cold in the building .
it 's not bad outside the building .
listen
got me doing it
is a transplant
how long have you been here ?
now five years .
have been pretty long here
then you know .
have been through five of those
there is
if that 's the time to go .
good idea .
real good idea .
it was beautiful .
is that
that 's really nice .
it 's so cool , you wear a jacket .
even in the summer time
is that right ?
they call it
you get ,
and it is ,
.
it 's pretty .
the spring
have to think every year to try to remember who is it supposed to
spring 's nice .
a lot of rain , in march
it 'll seem .
a lot of rain
we had this many inches
and we 're right on target ,
a lot of
though always .
it 's hard to remember what it was like twelve months ago .
it would n't come at once all
that 's right ,
that all heat and then get .
and
when it rains , it rains
you got into that bad stuff .
it did n't break anything ,
but we went out there afterwards
is n't
, known
you to pick up ,
and they are
they did
think that is one of the strange , strange things ,
very seldom and though
, have seen
really small
but this was really large .
apparently came through quite a few clouds rain
that is correct ?
are hail
it 's not
but it is in the clouds .
must be
i guess ,
and then , falling would warm it up and melt it ,
that 's what rounds
but .
was dumb
back to the house
stayed the weekend ,
called back to the house and
said
watched the news , and
anything about to worry
so dumb
found out
there was no problem with it .
's else
.
the streets and stuff around that area , get .
living close to that
,
that 's a nice area ?
up with new shopping centers and things more
it 's a fairly new area .
not too far away from that area , a new brand mall
was really , really nice
it 'd be nice .
really nice home
but you 're not right now living there .
is going to lease it
.
it 's investment property .
.
but it 's a very nice place .
cheerfully would live there
it 's not my home , of course
almost ten years
exactly just like
if , but it certainly meet my standards .
it 's a nice house .
that 's a nice area .
it on the golf course are ?
it 's not ,
it is off the golf course ,
'll be honest with you , and
where my house is
is that right .
that 's a nice area .
it is .
that is really a nice area .
hop you on that can
out just another belt line , .
do that
or used to anyway .
have been through all of that
they 're not really hills ,
, is not familiar with what
it along
a little bit more
out there ,
and we went up that coastline ,
that looks and
just a
valley .
valley .
know where is that
thousand oaks beyond .
know where valley , is
, have been out there before
you do n't
did n't notice anything strange about it
it 's just a strange landscape ,
do n't remember seeing that part of it
valley
it 's just a suburb of a l .
some new highways
people can get in and out a easier .
maybe it 's
it was far extreme ,
we 'd never find the place .
sound
area that
it 's a nice area out there .
oaks
you 've just a variety , i guess less .
do n't think it 's quite as green
it 's green with all the trees and things here out
it 's green sometime .
do n't know
it does n't stay green
of summers if you have been only five years here the
we have a really bad one
what type of music do you like ?
like , and sort of popular rock music type
too
have never really
my wife and enjoy it .
have never so
whenever she does
it and even put on myself .
used to play the piano ,
those nice really
like
do n't know all that much myself ,
known , just when
you like .
about how popular music ?
a hard time hearing clearly the words if
are pretty much the same way
known
, known
known
can remember after the song 's over
it two or three times
is the same way
it is
the difference in the radio with popular music , and is totally different ,
so , it was sort of a funny thing .
there 's a big variation among the country ,
are starting to realize that
really , never thought about that much
but there 's .
moved to this area
did n't really
it just seemed
it really changed , but when .
does it ?
you do n't have to wait till the hour mark .
it 's sort of constant .
you turn there , just
the latest news and everything and .
and it 's on .
that would be beneficial really .
so .
the news basically on the radio
never get
all the time the car , you 're
that 's pretty good .
like to listen to of music , on a long trip stuff tapes
now you can get on tape books and even .
on my grandmother fact do , because she is blind ,
or she 's .
can imagine if you are driving cross country listening to a story
lot of the classics
so , that 's a lot of fun
that would be good .
so guess .
music comes into that whole aspect of listening
we can cut off just
it was
good luck ,
and you make more some calls
thank you .
is that what
the i and ?
is that right ?
about how that ?
it 's a new home ?
it 's about eight years old ,
about eight years
it 's a thing type duplex .
living in a story brick and a half
what 's your house like ?
and have a big sun room on the back of it .
so it is also , ?
it does n't ?
it does n't have .
that 's what my wife really wanted
and
understand that
would love that too
our last house was n't too bad ,
but it was
this is
probably a year and a half from now , we 're going to try to build the next time
and very modern and very open and very light
you do have children at home ?
have three in college
three ?
they usually , at least two of them for the summer , to get back
you need still space , plenty of space .
still need a little bit of space
we have a lot less than we have recently .
already cut back
how big 's your place ?
that 's good size .
that is a family kitchen room and then the big room on the back
so we now is down to , two and two .
two and two
wo n't so it
but it wo n't be long that
.
you can one in the right area and if you can find .
so guess .
did n't go that route
the housing market probably going to go even lower and still
by the regular route just
is that
and we just decided
and we got for what we have a pretty good price .
as good as it would have been three or four years
few years
but that was
they did and sell it never .
so they stayed six months ,
she got back and her job ,
and he got a job down there .
they are not moving very well .
for .
and that 's a good example of it .
know where is that
have you ?
at a college here
so it 's sort of home now .
college
it is one of the colleges community .
two miles to
so it 's very nice , very convenient .
about nine miles to
it is to hear you from so good .
talking to you
so i hope
and have a good life , the rest of it .
thank you ,
same to you
a lot
read out of a couple groups only
is a big baseball fan , and
a lot of the books baseball
is too big a baseball fan
a lot of fiction science and .
school
during the school year just do n't have time to read and so
would it and
just do n't have time , but with
try to read a lot in the summer , but
, that a whole lot and of course being a woman ,
a lot of that
also sports but .
during the year because my son get that
, but do n't read a lot of nonfiction and
n't really
probably should
'll get books on history and stuff like that that look interesting
ever do n't get around to reading them and of course
do you ?
and 'll get stuff out of that
cry battle of
and it is eight hundred pages .
and it was
some of those books real tough to get into
but they 're really good after .
but it 's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so .
it is
these things and .
these things
but it 's hard sometimes .
it is right ,
that 's right .
and you do n't read a lot of fiction , you said .
a lot of fiction science
do you ?
really like , .
the same thing
have
is that right ?
have almost everything he is ever done
is going to enjoy it usually when
it is fun to do that .
amazing it that can somebody write that many books about science fiction
think that 's unbelievable
he really do
ghost wrote it actually for him
is that right ?
because it had foster 's style written all over it
is that right ?
read anything of his
have , but
some royalties from
is sure he does
would think he would
'd
he is doing all right , probably
is sure he 's ,
is sure he is
the more but sometimes you get
that 's true .
you 're a baseball fan ,
you are aware of that kind of thing .
in fact , is a fan sports , period
is that
because there is everything in it .
had a subscription to that last year ,
is a baseball fan , but mostly
the other stuff is interesting
in the stuff baseball mostly
is that right ?
that is too good .
is
is not from here
the mud hens
they are great .
the name
a really big article on
saved that issue , actually
you did ?
had the subscription
it was a lot of fun .
team
we used to go there all the time .
and we used to go to their games all the time .
they do n't exist anymore ,
do n't think ,
know
at least not by that name
play in the same location
, have been here for years twelve now
but we used to go to their games always ,
it was kind of fun and .
to a major league game
, do n't know
the , farm teams
major baseball league , minor league , baseball is a lot more fun than .
it is .
it is not quite serious so .
and it 's a lot cheaper .
that 's for sure ,
that is , for sure .
is that right ?
and they have a minor league team .
is that right ?
it 's just a lot of fun .
it is
bucks four now get in and
the hot dogs and
and it 's just great .
if you in the lot across the street from the stadium park , it 's four bucks .
here are the food outrageous .
it used to be three dollars .
four dollars this year to
that 's nice .
, is in the bleachers , way out in center field , but
but it 's nice still .
you can still see well .
we and usually unless somebody gives us tickets box seats or something , there
usually out there then .
the box seats there
run from eight dollars to twelve dollars .
is that
but we 're getting a new stadium next year
so it 'll go up .
it 'll go up .
some people or .
the new stadium
a lot more for the stadium
because i park for free free up , but at memorial stadium .
's and
go to the game cowboy
it is too high .
, baseball compared to other games
that did n't go over .
it did n't go through , .
that was and their main money making deal for the city .
if they would have taken it away
there are six flags right by the stadium ,
there is
all the tourists come there .
been
they would
and ,
is that
it there
that 's about what it takes to get to memorial me .
it actually .
is that right ?
of just south living
hop on ,
the stadium 's right off
so , it is i drive west
and are there
go , stop and go traffic , and everything
sports
but you do n't read many sports books
not really .
my son , do
and he read his hands .
he is because he for the high school he goes to play a fan basketball
but he 's reading it ,
and he says he is interesting , so mom .
you ca n't believe the all things he is done just .
is he really and
mom , you need
so i
there was a really good basketball book called a season on the brink
never heard
is not sure
do n't know
is trying to think
heard about the other night it just
mentioned and they
'll have to tell my son about that
is sure he 'd like it
that would be good .
get even when interested in the history of sports franchises ,
first your comments on
my first comments on the budget
what would be the first thing you 'd cut ?
defense ?
surprisingly .
mean private enterprise ?
have private enterprise do it ?
the prisons
they are already talking about it .
so , the government does n't have to deal .
had n't
but
think it 's all
but there is not enough in these prisons and that room .
private enterprise
in other words , they are in there for a purpose ,
sitting there than
, but the whole police department of the united states
the same way
, he should put in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there enough
any more than that
'd like to see again , but we but not in the education today
is so
would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world , and their educational problems
, but was talking to somebody else just
not so much pay
the government put out
you saying
here , but it 's just up to high school .
other of education out there rather than college
just doing it , which would bring back up the education ,
in a few years
is it not
but that would come down .
for a certain amount only the
they are trying to get more people into that field .
have gone before they can work even
see it being done
work for
and she is training her .
are assuming it can be done
of big companies now a
it unwilling to put the time in
a certain amount
there 's a lot to learn after that obviously .
but , that 's true .
my channel
let me to see if that clear this up
is that better ?
and of all we have a bad frequency there or something .
so we have some interference ,
changed so that
you were calling from around the world somewhere
think , but they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is , for them to train stuff like that people
programs like .
what they 've kind of options got
that would cut down for education but build up some of our budget , but again .
going on the unemployment list before we have
do n't mean college
is for college and
want their higher education , as far as
they had it
heard just something the other day ,
and then out of that percentage , so many only can get their degree .
thought that was interesting
have gone and got their degree , but
them out there have n't
and
that demographic area a lot of them there do go on
if , and they 'll make a , happier life for themselves .
question .
you threw that question on me about the deficit ,
put it now on your shoe
what would do you ?
my perception of the budget
and they have so much to spend
and there is not enough money to spread around .
and that we have more money going out and too many goods coming into this country .
the demand for their goods and obviously be quite high here ,
so they can get their goods in here .
being spent and the goods flow in we do n't sell products abroad
was the output from the united states
was in college
credit cards for college students
knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early
pack around a lot of them
of them a
you have a lot of discipline .
for people to get credit cards , especially college students
in college
one or in fact .
but they have a lot of credit cards both .
you limits such high credit and .
it is easy to get caught up in the minimum trap payment .
then they give you and the credit limit ,
you and then up to that limit is always
is almost always up to the limit on most of them
and that 's how a lot of people get .
'll have a balance
is getting a day thirty loan and
then they usually get run up pretty good .
you have a lot of discipline .
right now trying my best
pay off about four credit cards this year
up to the limit
and especially the visa card that you can go and get .
are short of cash , just
for cash before my visa
you can use it at a machine bank
you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card
or if you can use a personal identification number that you can use machines in the impact
do n't have a pin number for
sometimes you have to ask for that them .
and then have one that just gave me
the mail that one day
later we got pin numbers ,
we sent them
and we did n't want them .
and just contacting us without even sent them
do n't know if i trust or this not
that have a lot if you and you have been paying your bills on time
in the world everybody will offer you a credit card .
if can get her to run up we
but it 's hard ,
'll charge it just
'll do that , and sometimes
but will try to pay off the next month everything
, the ones usually have an outstanding balance all the time
like even that little bit helped
really need the way try to stay out of debt as much as possible
and get out of debt
because we never know when .
known
especially
had a lot of
?
think they are getting ready to sell us out probably , our division and
are
, they did n't they
it 's so kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards .
it 's certainly .
for a company jewelry
they have just jewelry this account .
they have about a thousand collectors , i guess .
bought jewelry , which is really a luxury item
and then they just ca n't pay for it .
something happens ,
so many stories listening to them and .
for a friend
they got it in their name
but they got it for a friend
then the friend and would n't pay them .
who did n't pay them
are they now and
and it is ruining their credit
and you have to watch this really .
that 's scary .
report to the bureau credit
most of them
did n't realize that
you 're thirty late days .
they do n't recognize any time difference , do they
that 's scary .
to see what your report credit looked like that is
you can do that .
believe it costs about ten dollars
might be worth it for peace of mind
it is ,
it is .
are what you might find even been reporting on you
and you did n't even know it .
you might think you are paying something on time
thirty days are not real bad though anyway .
if you 've got a charge off your report credit or something like that on .
that 's when it really get bad .
trying to get cash back as long
do they charge a lot of interest on that card ?
do n't know
so that would n't be too bad .
, known
had n't really read the terms of the credit agreement and
was never paying the off balance
looked at the credit card agreement , and one day
and have always it since then
that 's awful .
really you have to watch those interest rates .
i
giving them than any more money
that 's true .
of states can a
that 's great .
'll try to remember that one
's see
were trying to think if there were anything else
, though , was a credit card
order a sofa
but they were n't supposed to process it until they delivered it .
changed and my mind ,
and they charged on my account it
that the worst i thing probably have that have is so with a credit card ever happen
first you go
what is there to say ?
very well out in my opinion
n't so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty
it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty .
known
have seen a lot of people and
just endless , endless , endless appeals and then , just nothing happens .
it is building up , and
so it 's really building up .
is what is amazing of a number of years some them have been on death row for
everybody 's got that .
of those who was in jail for lesser crimes , in order to put more people into the jails the sentences
and it was just amazing ,
who got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out
ca n't remember
was that the one who was used in the campaign so much .
do n't remember
do n't remember myself
the question is do you think , it does make or do you think it can if it is done right ?
if they started to think that it might make a difference
do n't see it making a difference right now
going out there
most people out there committing murders do n't care .
they just do n't care .
but do n't
the police do n't catch them ,
the courts , or do n't convict them
or they do n't serve very much of the time
and so their success rate is very high .
crime , do pay
you can make a good living at it .
we have a big real bust cocaine and , just
a very , very small ring
and they just happened to get lucky and to catch the guy .
over a hundred dead already this year
last year it was
kind of up
going to commit murders
run out of people to murder if
is the only consolation so many of the murders
society , are not going to put them to death
maybe is going to at least
capital punishment is an appropriate for the kind of people where we say this sort of person 's just not acceptable to our society punishment
we there by going to remove temporarily but permanently them from society
do n't think much of life imprisonment
never of all first , it turns out to be life ,
second but why
that means you 're going to put them in a cage
you think it 's going to be safe for them to walk again the streets ever ,
then , why
'll ever going to walk again the streets
it makes sense ,
falsely have been
and few far between , but so
and that 's about it .
do n't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals
but it is rather
the truth than
we can be sure that way , and
we can find out the truth ,
base , not on the sentence on what the person did
my father-in-law , participated in a jury trial
he was on the jury , actually
killing two people
he did n't die of course .
when the guy with the bag they thought was money come out , and it turned out to be a couple jumbo cookies cookies
shooting people
they 're going to get even , so now .
and get even
stupid guys
he was able to identify the guy
they tried to make the look like what he was cop and of course
it was amazing .
what was the verdict ,
what was the results there .
was
heard he beat a push for the death penalty
not do n't know whether they finally got it
kind of
he would come home
and told us that was going on after the trial was over and
the penalty phase ,
from the verdict separately
and everybody was
and that 's the way they wanted to do it .
just decided , but the men 's fate when it all came down within an hour
i really two decisions there
really happen the way the prosecutor said
is this man really guilty ,
you have to decide and
do want to do with this guy who did this thing
never have been on a jury ,
had that experience
to making that kind of decision about a men 's life
it went pretty quick from what he said .
but there 's a lot of other crimes out there besides murder ,
drugs now there 's a death penalty associated with it
'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to
can handle people selling drugs ,
it is wrong ,
but it 's not worth
about so much and how it is not safe to walk the streets
'd and the people
it does n't really
.
would like to get out of here and get out and say
,
have , a low tolerance for that kind of person
a certain and associated with it
some of these people but .
you do exercise a lot ?
are it
and bought a house
my outside activities
lawn
a lot of
and
you name it ,
all kinds of stuff , flower beds
considered exercise
that 's true ,
that 's true .
there is always something to do
and it keeps me going .
you so far ahead of me
used to walk two miles a day ,
and enjoyed it really
because the two miles , went fairly quickly .
and that 's not stopping and talking ,
but it 's a lot .
all kinds of things
did to my knee
under a desk
or did something
the doctor had me on medication
she and do n't want to walk me ,
ca n't so walk
and before , she said the most conservative approach .
and do n't want to think of on my knee surgery her
do n't want to think about that , ever anyone
that 's a tough situation .
that is that microscopic stuff .
so are being very good
but , .
really
have an injury like that
my wife , like to run
of oak in the area castle park cliff the north
and she started running down there and all the hills .
she lasted about two weeks , and
her ankles and could n't take anymore it .
is just and ever since been real difficult
it is , because she start in
her ankles will start hurting again and
so she is kind of in the same mode .
she was all ready to get back and start running k 's five and k 's ten and stuff this spring ,
she been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to get back in shape really
when , and it is ,
it 's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise ,
and another thing is it
you can understand that
, do n't really want to
known , just
myself do it
and if
, do n't love it ,
will do it , but
not have been able to walk
be careful so much more
is it
it is ,
sleep , as well when
and it 's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff ,
your body just get used to it .
do n't enjoy it particularly
an awful lot and stuff like that
do
really enjoyed all that much ,
got used to it
it was ,
, did n't
physically
into that mode
threw if it kind and of
my knee is a hundred percent hopefully better .
maybe can get back
that 's for sure .
off a question you
you 're living in the area castle park ?
that 's right .
grew up in cliff oak
you really did ?
did
on candy ,
and that area , is that it changing back again ?
many people moving into those houses old back
it is .
it 's only about a block and a half , long
's over , but it
know exactly where is that
is on cliff boulevard oak north
that little on the hill in the trees there
and
an awful lot of
in fact , our little one block and a half there , four houses sold last summer
three and sold before the summer ,
and everybody 's
is that
that 's a gorgeous , gorgeous place .
it 's a lot of fun ,
the people great
there too , we 've got a real neighborhood active association .
we 've got every year regular four parties and
a recycling neighborhood program , all that kind of stuff and and .
so , it 's a lot of fun
and it 's a really beautiful area .
picking up some of those great big houses
and they are getting them at a real bargain .
.
you know .
and they are going just to town with them .
and it 's really coming around .
i guess
and drive around and look just
it is worth the trip .
is sure it must be
we have a little lovely house over there ,
it was a story two .
really story , because we have a basement , a half
the guy who built it , and was weird
.
these really creative houses , that
loved the neighborhood and just
everyone had and houses like that .
they were all completely different .
that 's right .
and
it was about two years ago burned out
a round on it
it 's all brick ,
and he is ready to put in a pool and things like that about .
so
there is a variety ,
the golf course
are not good that ?
she could , a little bit .
tell , what
and they have a mile track quarter there .
she started doing rather than to take off that
the problem is that she is a teacher school
for her , and she ca n't run in the morning .
and there are in the building , watching her and all that somebody ,
so there 's a lot of consideration .
hear really that
think you 're in cliff oak
block and on one of those blocks that it 's a neighborhood watch .
all we know ,
the street and do n't go anywhere .
because it 's not a street through .
that 's right .
that 's right .
and still want to get up early in the morning and walk
to him , because he was in the house with the lights on
walking out , it was more , when
he did n't
it looked dark .
and he was even
so , it 's not
it 's just because you 're smart .
that 's true .
that you do n't do things like that .
it takes only one time .
that 's right .
it 's a hard lesson to learn .
there is only one crazy out there to make .
it goes all over
what do you do to exercise ?
training three days on one day
basketball couple times a week
is that
what about yourself ?
that 's pretty impressive .
i bicycle
the amount vary
that 's about the extent of it .
do n't do any of those things particularly for exercise
what is the bicycling
it but mostly for fun .
ride
a bunch of or pretty flat
it vary .
and that 's mostly flat .
how long do that take you to get to work ?
it can be a pain .
i working on a campus
but , it is enough consistently one year ,
every day ,
but it just became such a pain .
and all this kind of stuff
it was a big hunk of the day .
another hour get back home and then of course .
on the evening , and then some more on the weekends get home
you do ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there ?
not so much
i mostly bike on
any extended trips with it
how about you ,
what kind of biking do you do ?
my wife just got me into it actually
, was a solid trainer weight
was weights and aerobic exercise
and and then said my wife got me into the aerobic exercise
began a program probably three or four weeks ago
.
and it was pretty tough ,
is looking at doing a lot more of it because my wife 's really into it , but
.
i kind and held her back a little bit of this weekend .
she wanted to go , go , go ,
but she wanted to stay with me .
it 's good to have a partner .
it 's really .
...
cool sometime if
people get into different aspects
they want to put some on their bike equipment and go for a tour .
never really
my wife would love just that .
and may do that sometime
again , there is
it is kind of funny .
this number
was just reading through a magazine bicycle and going through the different tours all coming up and
that 's nice .
bicycling is really big here .
and caught the fever of
but , other than that it is nothing up there like it is down here .
is sure why that 's not
just because of the winters maybe or maybe because there 's a lot more flat out in the west lands
biking so it makes
it is
a lot of resources , a lot of magazines and stuff
it is free
go to the bike shop and pick it
it 's got all the rides coming up , and
that 's terrific .
have so long
for just about the past three years
did it before that was college , which was about ten years ago
and
'd try it , too
, have n't
because , it really improve your cholesterol
down two of the big risk for coronary arteries disease which categories
that 's great .
that 's good .
on
when you do that get to begin with the winters and all ?
you do if you ca n't ride outside ride inside ?
in fact a lot of people will ride in the snow outside .
and do n't do that
pretty much for the winter off
getting rollers for the last winter
an exercise bike and that kind of thing but .
but
kind of a problem
more or less out of shape now
but
it 's pretty good .
for me the main thing is
about four different routes from my house around
or sometimes 'll come in the school
nice because it 's all along a canal path ,
what school 's it ?
so it 's a good ride
as long as you 're not doing it every day , it 's a good ride .
that 's true .
sounds
and do n't want to
is that
that 's really good .
good talking
it was good talking .
and keep the good working up .
too
take care .
somebody abandoned her
and , she is only six to eight weeks old
and ca n't understand why anyone would abandon this dog , though
she is this young
she go out
that 's great .
and
was
, do n't know
ca n't imagine what would have been wrong with this dog ,
she appeared just .
my husband , calls her dog street
we have her now for about three years
you get
but he was able to get him over that actually .
, he was getting just healthy ,
so could n't believe it
that was really hard .
was on a trip business at the time
, by some friends of mine down the street
so they just felt awful absolutely .
i bet
because probably for them than for me
was
but it 's unfortunate ,
, but now have got another one
been since the first one
it was just over a year .
it was in march of last year .
so
did n't have one for a whole year
and it just when she died absolutely destroyed me .
could n't even for months talk
decided that is it , and so
are not going to do this anymore
my dad , is like that
there 's no way ,
she and turned out to be a great dog
we have until she passed away just recently for six years and her
and dad went through the whole thing again ,
just
it 's like a kid .
it is .
hopefully , cocoa will .
her a golden mix
who know
and her nose is
she does n't have a brown nose ,
the same
that 's not too bad .
that permanent smile to them
they 're always happy .
've ever seen them not look happy
she love everybody .
little kids , and can just maul all over her
and she just think it 's great .
and we took the dogs fishing up two
getting in
he actually had no trouble at all .
he first jumped in
but he jumped in the river .
was careful to keep her away from the fast moving water ,
that 's good ,
and would not
then , he jumped again , and in
for quite a bit , all afternoon
he loved it .
cocoa did n't think , though too much of it .
me pull back out her
wrap her up in a sweatshirt
but , she , got over it
we have a little pool ,
and she did not
she get in the pool on the first step
lay off just there on
i live right across the street from a big lake here ,
if she 'll want to go out there and go swimming next year
so she does n't
is watching her ,
the one that we have just did n't want any part of that .
baths .
just really a fight
it 's so cute .
is an part of the movie
, could n't figure out in the lake because he would go
he did n't seem to have normally ,
wanted but if you
on her step
but that was
and she did n't
but you really need see that movie .
we bought the movie
and do n't
was watching it again , and
heard and my husband
ca n't believe you still is getting a kick out of that movie such
'll have to check out it
see the , previews for it , and all
and it did look like it 'd be a good movie ,
it is great .
had n't a whole lot of time to get out
got to do more things fun , but
always wait until
is a second in the air force lieutenant
travel a lot .
and
but it 's nice having a dog here ,
are looking
that 's it .
at all critical
they are
it 's been nice talking to you ,
what it had a death penalty does n't it ?
started late or , within the past few years it just too , just again
for quite some time , just about every one of the states have given up the death penalty .
but it now is coming back into favor .
it is
but now that 's just what they said .
do n't know
if they 'd now say it 's a deterrent maybe .
think if that 's where they are coming from
their minds changed
maybe is that it .
that 's it , maybe
.
that was before they adopted the law death again .
.
include children
, and not to be sure what it 's
stop at children
adults , too , to
is very personally in favor of it
do n't
either do n't
is for the sake of argument , or just
's against it
you know
just this black men served recently for robbery nine years .
there was that the black woman , robbed
she actually killed , but the furrier .
with murder
then , and then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something .
did n't retain all those facts very well
what if we make a mistake .
that 's it .
and that 's not
do n't even with the death penalty in effect
like you say
all a
would have a problem with it
why should they be sitting getting their college degree in prison .
that 's tougher .
it is easier to and say ,
it 's a deterrent to crime ,
but to be one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me .
very true
with you there .
'd do it probably
a easy real thing
but do n't know
would n't want to be on the jury like that myself
that 's an awful lot of a person to expect ,
to kill somebody is what it amounts to .
but that 's what they did .
but they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason .
it was just the only way
wanted the human life and
we both agrees it should be in effect
hang them .
it should be in effect
there should be a lot of care in the enforcement ,
it be in effect
have a problem with this , too
think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get more one chance
that 's true .
about in a death verdict the union to believe in just
that is correct .
it is ,
it is .
's inclined to agree with you
think so
there should be as to the number of appeals a limit .
dealing in drugs .
drug dealers
certain circumstances
and do n't
they are
they are not selling them ,
they are distributing them .
it is for the large what dealers are
in effect killing people
believe it is any capital crime related to drugs
think that 's the way it is worded
is how it is
knew it was there
or is it proposed
or is it passed ?
do believe that is in
would n't
believe it is ,
thought it was in effect , but
believe you 're right , though
think it 's
and have to agree with that
think it should be one of the options certainly
fortunate so far , with my children and grandchildren that
that heavily
you never know ,
have n't to the best of my knowledge , but
but just so many young touches
my children in the same age bracket about
it does .
have four sons myself ,
they pretty well up
and they went through it going through high school and everything all
they did n't try it ,
, would n't know
they are using it now .
is in fact
it is the same age bracket .
and there are four , two girls and two boys .
and very slightly with pot
and think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge
that 's the way it is usually .
it 's just with their peers try it out .
none of them and even smoking .
n't
my ex-wife , when she was pregnant with the last one
and she never started up again .
and just about fourteen months and two weeks ago .
that 's tough .
it is .
and it seems to be getting tougher as by time goes .
my husband
and he knows
and he knows that he should
but n't
do respect though the fact that he refuse to smoke in the same room with me
very conscious of
concerned about it
felt that way when
or 'd hold the cigarette under the table
, have seen
now , but the shoe is on the other foot .
other people now
he will get up
and he 'll go outside ,
they have children .
he and
he changed to a brand he does n't like brands .
he will not in a comfortable position smoke ,
still , but he is
it 's a , long process .
there is a trick i use .
how
one at a time and .
and that gets to be , a deterrent .
he had his in the kitchen ,
have you taken
why
and we have no problem with it .
we got our money back .
getting better or worse in
believe they 're better
, too , .
about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time ,
believe they 're better now ,
think so .
do n't
not as
pretty good , reliable
my electric blanket was only one year old went
you did return it ?
have
have taken the first back one
did n't think it heated well enough
it never did
took it back
and the people told me is the way
for it fell and
it heated and when
and then it started after one year
so either you or your husband can be warm
but not both .
also took an iron back after having only one year it
, need to have
they did replace it ?
without any even question ,
but think it was the store
had any clothes and new
last summer was a dress
and the buttons on it turned over the winter .
the buttons
not have gone back and
that was
think it 's too ,
and it was an expensive dress .
if it was n't expensive ,
it was .
buttons on it that would last forever
that 's right ,
that are too
and it was over a hundred dollars .
you spent that much on your dresses ?
n't usually
did , but that one
it should have been better than that , for that money
, too , of course , .
believe we have been talking about five minutes
think so .
talking to you too good
enjoyed it
you up all the time
we 'll be talking to you later .
in the jury system
at all .
have taken justice criminal two classes
must you then
thinks the system is fine right now
think it should be by a jury
do n't think it should be either unanimous even
what about the idea that is one guilty only when proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt ?
of the idea then if everyone agrees that there should n't be any reasonable doubt a unanimous jury was
but if , it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable for some people doubt .
do n't know
course that there is
what they 're doing but .
have you served on a jury ?
never
, either have never
few my friends have
they say they are remarkably incompetent .
start just as soon as they and then
the prosecution and defense choosing the jury
they do n't want you on the jury .
they do n't want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system .
exactly .
that anyone can get out of jury just about ,
or not falsely arrested
tried by a jury of my peers
tried by a jury of people who had nothing else to do and were n't very knowledgeable ,
and do n't know ,
a little bit
have never even
was
was out , but
and apparently they thought
so did n't make any noise about it
come back
and said they
was out at the time , but
is so
, do n't know
there 's a lot of problems with the legal system
, do n't know
you could , if you just could have a simple majority or something pretty much
that 's hard to say .
so it is , saying , we do n't like the way he look
witness expert testimony
juries extremely vulnerable to sort of emotional pitches
them pay as much as possible
things like .
ca n't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury ,
having a jury at least not
do n't think the judge should make just the decision alone
going to decide
you 're the person 's fate .
a judge work together on
i wonder if that 's possible ?
the judge 's timing is worth too much , though
they pay compared to that judge those jury members very little money .
he makes put together in an hour than all twelve of them more money .
probably ,
but
somebody 's life is in twelve people 's hands
and those twelve people could sometimes care less .
because they kind of pick when out .
of course .
it 's political maneuvering .
will want to hang everyone ,
is the one other and
or sensible or rational juror
want that
it was a little bit harder to serve on juries not actually
an awful lot of intelligent people
they answer because you can do that , and the wrong way just one of the questions
say they just
at court
if it was a family members of theirs , though that was innocent , then they 'd want to be on that jury .
they would be
you have to do something and .
it sounds like we need both get out there and serve on a jury .
called up too long before
would
is ready to go
they call me up yet
they will eventually .
it was nice talking .
it was nice talking .
familiar
that part of
vacation a lot .
about how
quite frequently .
we did
we retired early
so , we pretty often take trips .
all you guys
down the coast that 's all up kind of a visit family and a vacation
so go out there
that all these places have never been .
is that right .
where do you go ?
what type of vacation ?
really
and so we 've been out there
and is a big real baseball fan
of somewhere games a
what club do you follow ?
me too
usually try to catch what is in town , though
that 's about it ,
a lot of little trips around here
not that much
have you ever heard of it ?
have
have been there never
it is
and it 's really cool .
so they did n't have any power
and we went up about a year later
and it was
where else did we go , so
you did ?
have you been there down ?
with her sisters
but have n't been , down there
that 's
catch a football game actually just
spend a day , and a lot of money
but it 's
to just to be a good town
we 'll do that , .
you can
a good town
just it pay somebody to get into the buildings
that 's right .
did n't know that
they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing , or another ,
but they have a good time
we really did n't really do that this time ,
we just visited around .
we 've done
and that is enough for another probably twenty years .
actually think it was closer to a full year
really have no great urge to go back now and
is great as a kid , though ,
it was great , because the times really was fun was when we have vacation
so we basically had one of the parks .
there was nobody when we , there was there
straight five times
we just get done with them
want to go again ,
to , sometime
that 's good ,
that really
we 've been probably and two or three times .
, never have been
keep wanting to get further , so
but never did it .
it 's a pretty real place .
do n't know when we 're going to have vacation to do it
than a year
.
it is by green bay up .
are my girlfriend
it on one of the lakes 's ?
n't
that 's door county .
that would be nice really , .
so we are thinking that 'll be a lot of fun ,
she had this book of pictures from it that were really nice , kind of like a travel guide
good sound .
so that should be a lot of fun .
, do n't know what our next trip will be
the first one ,
that 'll be fun .
of the summer the
you wo n't even though , notice it .
be
this data
the connection , right there
that 's it ,
never asked him how he was connected , the other day
the most people of
.
so it was fun
actually yesterday 's
is that right .
and she is too working ,
she is talking on the project too
got a call yesterday and
is that
had n't something
getting just the guy , one from the lab
sure you have a nice town ,
do , she ,
that 's nice out there .
we keep wanting to get there down and visit them over the summer
and it never really works out .
it 's real pretty .
for vacation really
either
you guys , golfers
too much into
except our outside , though
just walking
that 's all .
do n't
traveling in my early teens down in that area
and is
no professionals .
might be minor league
may be seeing them in a town just west of here ,
think we may be seeing them this , weekend and
think they 're out
have been up there never
a little bit
the inner harbor and the aquarium and all that very nice
been drug
that 's a good question .
had to go get a test blood
they did a full screen blood on me , and
but they did n't called a test drug that .
think they checked for drugs
they do n't tell you did they just .
could start working at different jobs
and do n't mind them
do n't do drugs anyway
did , maybe
but do n't know
she is a nurse ,
and they get .
have , never
depends if you got something
so guess .
so guess .
do you think that it is right ?
have done assistant employee work and
the kind of cost businesses
it is in the billions of dollars and every year .
and is the only way that they can prevent that .
that 's true .
and get in an accident
up for you
and , nobody knows about it ,
but end up costing the company lots and lots of money .
that 's true .
, it is right , especially for certain jobs
randomly drug
in that full force , .
believe every secretary in every company needs to be
face forward fall in their typewriter or something
so do n't know
do n't do drugs
really do n't care one way
so , i guess is
is one of the problems with it
it does .
generally because you know .
out one way or another if somebody 's got a problem on the job
that 's true .
it is , if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then it still is a problem just the secretary
that 's true .
to a party three days before
and it 's been the whole weekend since they 've done anything
and they could be fired for that ?
that 's kind of unfair , also .
comes
so guess .
you need suffer the consequences if you 're going to do it
in terms of drugs , and they are illegal .
you are so breaking the law anyway .
that 's true .
that 's true .
probably is the biggest problem with those
that 's true .
and that is the biggest problem there 's probably .
think so
more than drugs
they would pay for an alcohol
but they do n't always pay for drug rehabilitation .
out of it , some of the employee assistance program
if they will give you an opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose .
that 's true .
think that 's fair ,
in the long run the company benefits
that 's true .
say on it
what kind of they
it 's a urine test .
urine screen
it was really very official .
seal the bottle yourself
so that they are anybody 's or something .
that happens .
, known
it 's hard to believe ,
it happens , a lot .
it does
to help them out
known
, at the things that people will do ,
it 's amazing .
are
expensive tests and .
be never had to pay for one
it depends on how strong a test it 's really .
they 've got different degrees , as far as how far they can check back .
so guess .
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests .
doing hair tests
weird how
did n't know that
that 's weird .
and it is apparently almost like a calendar .
got pretty now it
they can go back and look at , in terms of growth in a hair , when you used and that type of thing .
that 's wild .
it is the amazing things they can find out from on your body different things .
that 's true .
that 's true .
never giving blood
of giving blood
talking to you
did , too
thank you .
your suggestions in making a successful reunion family
have a big family , i guess
that 's a start .
so guess .
old how
just got
on having my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters , and then all their kids and grandkids
let they do in advance long
on
the third weekend in
it 's so every four years
so they know all .
that is .
that sounds like fun ,
all have the too small children , that come
much .
all ages
there are some my age and
some a lot younger , about four generations , i guess and then .
my husband on
they do n't ever and
if people have in mind then it
six months ahead to get , because they are rather too socially active in touch with everybody
so it seems by doing it , and they can get there everybody pretty much .
if we 're planning to go to a certain place ,
is already and
six months ahead but .
of very large families the
therefore , they do n't have .
, have n't known many of those people
really just it but in the last few years
that 's been very nice , and
and three brothers
and they are only three out of five of us who have children .
quality time with
they do n't and
we really do n't know many of them .
kind of
it 's really ,
they are fun ,
they are a lot of fun ,
but they are still not done on a regular basis
of what happened , and what they were and from the time before .
with immediate family
a lot of my cousins real close
we got together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that , and always
do n't
it 's very pretty country
it is gorgeous .
is when
it 's like , was the last one my high school graduation
the next one was when
more about two years
and do you think you 'll have a baby with you take back .
maybe ,
, do n't know
maybe .
two more years
, do n't know
probably
now for about nine months
to be sure ,
probably not all of your family and then .
he is ?
so they met all ,
and does he ?
n't either
have a friend who is working , but
all the data
, do n't know
have a hard time getting on the telephone people
getting through to anybody
i call and sometimes on all day ,
but got off that
we 've kind of everything exhausted i guess .
think we have been talking probably
it been fun talking to you
too you
thank you .
and maybe 'll talk again to you
go ahead
and that 's
was used to the heat right now , out here , so
and it gets very cold at night .
and it 's nice really .
so it 's
it pretty cold , for as nice as it is even during the winter
over the coast
again the next morning and then usually back off
in the weather just a little bit ways
and it gets very hot and dry
the fog and make it far that never .
like down there is what it ?
right now we are having the little bit of spring we have .
at least you 've got some .
we do n't have many seasons here .
it goes , usually from winter to summer .
usually spring consists of a lot of rain .
we have one of those blow through tonight .
that 's good .
think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days and
for this time of year .
it is not really been too bad .
quite a bit
the season , is just about over
.
and we came back .
what day was that ,
thing we 're getting now
is glad to hear that
was n't getting any of the strings of you were the tornadoes and stuff ?
but this is the season for that .
they do occasionally pop up , around here .
do n't really miss there all the heat
a bit of a relief
is originally from here ,
the biggest problem with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil .
it is
so it does n't absorb real well the water .
it a bit little rains , it 's
everything else and run just , off
you know .
it 's a complete mess ,
we have it ,
we could use some rain up here .
of the fourth year of drought , up here the
and they have a pretty good early spring
we got quite a bit of rain , and
but it was n't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years .
and there 's no problem with water .
and it 's pretty much
they have rolling hills around here
dead , for the majority of the summer , golden grass to
but it 's a really nice area .
like you said you have the cold winter
and then you have the summer hot spring .
spring like year
and that would be spring and fall .
any of the other ones
but it 's a really nice change of pace .
'd prefer that
to the heat
do n't really miss the heat
a lot of outside running and stuff
or is it pretty dry .
it 's pretty dry .
more and more
it is right by the ocean here , and
but the water here is extremely cold , up here ,
all the beach
if , but you have to wear a wet suit , because it 's just extremely cold
cool because of the ocean cold water for some reason , is the air ,
that about this area
had n't just and
it 's just completely different
and it is
it does
the air and do n't feel like along the gulf coast region it does anything .
we like , but
so it 's a nice change .
of years a
that 's nice .
it 's been good .
we there for about nine months
and that was a real change for me .
i
parts
we 're in the western in the mountains edge over .
but they are so good about clearing the roads , that it usually do n't bother you very much .
it never get real , real hot .
just have been never really in that region of the country and
is going to have to try sometime that area and see
they get , and
and it does n't really hang that long around .
the people
and they want to go back .
nothing seems quite as good .
but , .
as we were talking the weather
and there 's a flood flash watch , rain more for the next three or four days .
hope it move up this way ,
but is sure it wo n't
maybe we can send you some .
because we could use it sure .
who : take care of the time
think that will do it
good luck to you
too
we 'll see you .
tell me about your home .
it 's an older home .
back in the early sixties
it 's a pier house beam .
just that makes and
that 's pretty tough .
what do you live ?
.
that 's pretty typical for your area ?
, to be in for
the more established neighborhoods
that sound .
living in the three basic bedroom , two bath home and .
have at least two bathrooms so
that 's not so bad ,
but it 's pretty typical for the area , as well .
have always
think you can doing more end up
what about space yard ?
do you have a big lot or anything like that ?
is sitting on 's roughly half an acre
.
have about a quarter acre of that about half of that got a garden
that 's nice .
those tract basic houses , you know ,
like that
we have a very small yard
do have garden , and
but it is extremely small ,
but it seems like though for your area 's sort of different .
a big city like most houses that would
in the newer neighborhoods and development communities ,
you can if your neighbor is having an argument for blow it blow here .
that is exactly right .
is that
so we have quite a few parties ,
and seems like everyone who live around us , end up hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone .
that 's true so
, is the houses
but it is fine for now ,
hopefully , eventually , we 'll move in a larger home .
who only the thing is the rooms
it 's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that ,
your rooms in your house bigger since it 's a home sixties
, because it seems like then that they built the homes much larger
that 's true ?
and they 've got better closet space .
that new houses have seen .
that 's really it .
is that
that 's not so typical maybe so ,
it helped a bunch .
it really do , , except
in those bills visa and then get .
you can compare yourself to any thing around there
are pretty typical
everybody got a pretty good yard size
, got the biggest probably
, in the entire neighborhood pretty close to it
that 's nice .
that 's nice .
you have the yard to deal with
that though
do you .
time more than
is sitting out here right now
we had this terrible rain
looking at the yard
was in an apartment or something ,
are it
, do n't know
we do just terminate this
or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time ?
you do know ?
somewhere between five and ten minutes to
anything else about the house
you working on it
that area do a lot of renovation
keep this entire neighborhood , everybody
that 's nice .
the town is a town older ,
that was so much fun and .
that was a good for me to learn a lot of discipline experience and
and was considered typical for that area .
so it was quite a change for me to come now that 's just a little very square box
and there is not a whole lot you can do with it .
living in the city has some advantages .
that 's true .
if given the choice , .
this town was less than people ten thousand
big the city
in a rural area for so long
have so
but it can get kind of tough .
it 's like a rat race sometimes .
is that
do n't want to be a part of the race rat
alone just kind of
and with my garden mess sit around
it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well .
very much
do really enjoy that
have n't but
but have n't done , yet that
had finals this week
, so are just kind of trying to stick with that in
can get this in shape yard , but maybe since that with now is over
a lot of
in the garden , have got my beans , peas
is not real sure what they 're going to do this year
never have much luck with tomatoes
plant so easily a lot of beans
have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that , and
so soap , the only thing is that i use .
that will keep the bugs off them
them with anything
what do you do ?
you do have any tips you could give me ?
my favorite is one to put , dust
of time the
that 's true .
that 's true .
my dad is a farmer
have heard him talk
it works ,
your vegetables after that
so it wo n't make you sick .
's
what to do you to your house ?
you have enough space
you could probably do that .
about adding more room at least one and adding on another bath definitely
that 's tough .
have a half bath
not even a half bath
that 's rough .
have one bath and a half
that was and even just with two people .
that was a pain .
that 's good .
a lot of
you have to share a bathroom
that 's right .
it does not make for a happy situation .
that 's true .
you do have any children ?
have got one
one child .
where they are living
he 's nine months old .
so he does n't know .
he is a big help out in your garden , i guess .
around a little bit
him play in the dirt
he is enjoying himself
that 's right .
it is healthy ,
why .
he was eating the dirt ,
would n't worry about it
it wo n't hurt them .
and turned out
so , do n't worry about it .
just let
you move away from the big city
was raised in a town was about people ten thousand up
you are so
you want to go back to that ,
.
that 's true
ready to talk ?
so guess .
you a general description of it
and you can help out a little me
bit .
we 're on the east coast now
we looked at our budget ,
we and so was draw a budget we thought was realistic
so , and we have to make some adjustments
and we he wants to do that , is satisfactory
we 've been here seven months and
and he is
so ,
throw real fast that
we actually planned for about one year .
because , it never occurred that it would take to us .
that was smart .
what and just what we did was decide how we have been spending our money before ,
on the computer that
where we did n't want to come down , and
that 's great .
you did have a special program on your computer to do that
our own just design
we spent too much money , until our children , went to college
do you all have a budget ?
for five and a half years
and really did have a real strict , budget
we were in graduate school
and we were just dirt poor .
'd then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided
.
do n't know if we did a good thing to buy a house or not so
but at least we 've got a place to live .
three and two a year old
that really threw out our budget .
quit working with the kids to be home
, do n't know
different times
we 've done a survey of taking the past three months of where all the money went .
we do n't really and
for it to work , though , you have to do something .
not really and then it is that realistic
of course not .
and they are both boys
just so
is for us the hardest part
find the place that it was harder for me
we tended to want to keep on giving lavish , gifts as , we have done before .
really believe that if you 're going to cut down on yourself , you need somewhat cut down on your friends and
on your friends ,
that 's true ,
that 's true .
we have both older cars
something , and will come up and having to spend a thousand dollars on the car in two months or something wind up
hard to plan for a lot of things like that
really
think you have to those things budget , though ,
kind of put in a certain amount per year
you 're going to have .
you do n't spend it
see 's
which way
list all the deductions
get back at we and then ,
you do n't want the government to spend your money .
that 's what my husband , said
this last year he changed , of course , it
we did n't get back nearly as much
and it was .
another way of saving money
do realize that , which is realistic for some people , but
it was for us , and for many years .
if that 's the only way that , and it will make you save and have
that 's what you should do .
we do n't miss it ,
n't really , when it 's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff ,
she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty ,
so , it can be done .
i guess ,
, there is a way
that 's fantastic .
talking to you
too talking
and do n't spend this weekend any money .
known
we 'll have to stay home and mow the yard .
make a fair amount of money ,
get my money 's worth
, in general , though the allocation of the taxes in certain areas , is n't correct
is sure every person in this country probably would agree with you on that
and extraordinary amount of money
and is sure to have gotten regardless of the outcome of the desert situations shield we really not
there is an extraordinary amount of waste
take that as a given in any military operation
no argument here
that would be ,
increased in that area expenditures
in the course of fighting the war
they used up two thousand of them in the war , and
see 's
as being a greater one
do n't think there is very much of a threat there today
left in their territory over there , and that 's controlling them ,
that 's true ,
that 's true .
do n't know what amount
, in a matter of just a few weeks , of course now , we used up
a big percentage of that and
what 's the name of that ?
and a big percentage of that were also used up during that conflict .
and that was an area
in the area of defense ,
pay too much there
, do n't know
and it 's a cliche ,
myself , but
see where 's the infrastructure sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways
no doubt .
, do n't know
is familiar with some upbeat school areas ,
do n't agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there , so totally
the more affluent school districts
they do n't have a broad base income tax on fund the educational system ,
all out of local taxes
then we have a number of education reforms , that we got to do this , said the legislature
we got to do this ,
we got to do this ,
they put the money to pay for it in the state budget
and they dumped all it on the local school districts .
now sounds like the way the federal and state system works .
so what ended up was a shift happening .
do you mean a complete reversal ?
because they ca n't raise that money in those poorer districts ,
complete .
shifted to local districts ,
are even the money that 's been raised for the local districts and now
that 's right ,
that everybody ought to be able to have ,
what you 're saying
is a product by myself ,
did so
my masters , anyway .
but when i look at it really to me it does n't make any difference .
could n't have done ,
that 's right .
you have to perform community service ,
out of their , budget
it does n't sound like a lot of money to me ,
do n't know what that would be
they have to raise taxes college community here , a few years ago .
and now , the states do n't have enough money
so they must charge fees .
is not sure of that reasoning too
taxes too much but .
who , a great deal in taxes
can believe that
costs money to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax me it
not be fairly close up to that
so you really ?
really .
feel my taxes in the last ten years have gone up ,
they have n't gone down .
quite a bit more taxes
everybody 's .
's slow down the rate of increase
this been really interesting
enjoyed our talk
i guess
again push one
we just say
and is that it .
hang up just
talking with you
with you , too .
about our lawn and garden chores
do you 've either one ?
really do anything with
,
do you .
we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden
that is fun , and
fresh vegetables in the summer
the i things doing
do so
rather have to be outside than inside any days
so would .
you do work during the week outside the home ?
.
my gardening chores
i work for a school system
get home , a little earlier
and can still do some sorts of things
out in the morning after starts daylight time savings and with your cup of coffee
is not , unfortunately ,
i love
and because it was n't
organized a very large garden club , but
is that
always it 's something that seem odd so
you can accomplish something
to help too other people and that 's
or anything like that
is that
those numbers were great
think it sounds good
to a garden club
the organized sort of format
very much
women 's most clubs garden
, would like
not just flowers like women
gardening clubs men 's in
they are women .
and they are usually the type tea things where they have a little luncheon
their thing and .
primarily the emphasis
that
flowers sort of look pretty
think so too .
but really like to do the vegetables
what being ?
what a wonderful thing
it was nice ,
it exhilarating for many years
many of those
me is what in your garden , since this year .
going to go out today
need be concerned about not getting
and they are better .
n't
, do n't know
maybe this climate is a little better .
we but usually in the vegetable garden , what
our favorite , is something called green half white beans runner
is n't that funny ,
my favorite is so .
why you know
and that was my mother 's favorite bean
she always grows five different varieties ,
but that 's the kind that produces the best .
think it has the best flavor
and they are
and have very little string and then just steam them , a little bit
when they are fat my mother pick them
in
and they are good both ways .
in
the flavor is better in between .
size
my mother does n't
know and
but i think , that is another vegetable .
of course .
them that way
it is .
they are two different vegetables that way ,
and she would
but she does n't have a big that garden ,
but she has
, and have children four
and she tend to it herself ?
is n't
it is ,
it is great .
it 's really her joy
, up because with it
think so too .
we and a lot
there is no just replacement for growing fresh tomatoes .
that so
were actually successful for the last two years , but
is going to do it again
bet you showed them .
that 's right .
you have that problem there or not
they and .
a long time
hearing so much you
it is
wish you good luck , and
that 's not very long so .
so
is the weather
.
that 's great ,
that 's great .
it 's just terrific ,
a little rains
i hope you have an opportunity to garden again .
think so
you on any kind of regular exercise plan
step classes ?
what is that ?
a new form
it 's like low aerobics impact
instead of hopping and jumping you just step
you have a step
to literally and up on the step
it 's new ,
it is fun .
could n't do that because of my knee probably
bad knee
play tennis in
is not too great at it
try to play , but
have kind of got out of the habit myself ,
right now is on two teams
so it 's four nights a week .
enjoy so it
and instead of having to join a health club and make myself to go out there
need make myself to do that
from graduate to
this past couple months and so
, have n't really gone so
going and working out of
to what you school ?
but
is that
for certain groups muscles movements
you can do it if you wanted to with weights
but left out of there
wake up the next morning you , is the next morning , if , usually
do to myself
is looking forward ,
are out of shape
for three or four years now
stayed in pretty good shape during school ,
played baseball , all the way through
of six or seven days a week that kind and usually working out six hours a day , .
got out of school , but ever since
stuff stay on any kind of
weird i some work hours and .
, do n't know if your campus was anything like ours
one of the campus
the buildings and
did n't have much of a problem
so , it 's pretty small .
of miles at work at least a
live on the second apartments story
and walk up down stairs all day
we 've got a house one story now
that 's enough .
that is .
that is one of the exercise , now .
, would like to start running
never have been much of a runner
, but want to start
want to run
'll be able to do it
, to like to or because you wo n't be able to just because
wo n't be able to
if you should n't have any problem running .
hope not .
occasionally but again nearly often not enough
, do n't even own a bike
was on a bike ,
, do n't know
how to ride a bike
you ca n't forget how to ride a bike .
that will be considered exercise
should do
a junior college for
the whole team semester one
was the next semester and
for course it , we have credit
was still but
tough classes
most of the guys were all in one class
of it on
wake up .
you have bands ,
do n't know , if you 've seen ,
they are weird .
think my wife had some
they are made of different kinds of rubber just ,
or some of them ,
it would n't be sand
, gray and green
some of them real short
is the tough ones to use and
but those classes
you get an instructor is fun
she is doing , the class is not going to get out what they should get out of the class .
are
are
is an interior design , major
field instructor type
never could do that ,
'd be just the student , rather
the weights at the health club but weights low
they really knows how to isolate each of the different muscle groups , with those things
do n't know
just notice at our health club they will put on these computerized machines
a speeding on it , and the weight
it and make it
if you 're going too slow it will say , my grandmother could do this faster than you .
and the whole this machine place can hear what is telling you .
a little negative reinforcement there while you 're going .
so do stuff like that
have just but never
the free weights like little hand pound five weights and eight weights pound hand
starting really
getting just
think that 's number one problem with everyone
put a lot of weight on
that were about four years
just real soft , but
keep but
it would turn into a task , ,
do n't
i plan getting back on .
next weekend ?
weekend next
one week
then i plan get right back into it .
think it does for you a lot
make a lot
there 's no question the end result is great
was playing ball
you so much better , about yourself
that cake after dinner
n't still
that 's a problem .
thank you .
it was nice talking .
too you
have taken place in the last generation
one is the biggest number of women in the work force
my mom and did n't
was well into high school
it 's a luxury item for mothers to be with their kids home .
was shorter
she was always so , home
home by the time you always got home .
that statistic been growing every year
is not that
it seems that there is a effort grass roots or whatever going on
, clean houses
believe and almost all
that is unusual .
think it 's kind of a new movement
women came into the work force in the last twenty , thirty years
and and now are wanting to go back to the old days where women with the kids stayed home
think you 're going to see a lot more women choosing not to work after they have a baby and
it thought and seem like it is the upper-class more people ,
, do n't have yet
would like to be able to stay home with my kids , but
that is probably not going to be possible for middle-class people to be able to live
that 's tough .
we 're looking at that now ,
my wife 's along about six months .
think it 's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
the quarter of a home dollar million and
women do stay home
would think that it would be women who was working full-time
or not , though ,
in volunteer work
but it is almost like a job ,
she just do n't get paid for it .
i guess
, is your wife she going to stay home
she or are going to go back to work , ?
we 're going to try and have her stay home , for as long as possible .
what do you think ?
would like to be able to do that
we think it 's important that
i kind of that direction and back in
a real good family structure and .
where the attitudes was a lot different .
going on in today 's society
it seems like people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards
in family in terms of being the father figure almost
with women working so much and they are
kids raised their friends around and by the media
that 's true .
and that is ,
a lot more of
a lot of
coming about in computers at home and those types of things , which would bridge the gap in at least some ways
, the family unit as it is going to be nonexistent
what do you think ?
do you think there 's going to be a family still unit
more towards single parenting
the balance
it got and
that 's hard to say .
such a strange configuration
about the same time you did , up
was pretty much in those times and back
it is not the case , nowadays
with all kinds of junk
because there are so much more income in the family with both parents working and is one of the reasons
with junk
and they do n't have to do anything around the house .
living at home with mom and dad
a bigger family , generation after generation
it 's not a real functional situation anyway .
so do n't know that trend is going to change
thinks the family unit 's just not going to exist even anymore eventually
is the rate divorce
that 's pretty sad .
it is ,
keep probably i guess unless there is a major swing in the change of what is important to people
and do n't know
we feel we can make on one income it
it may be tough
but we may have to give up on some things .
thought though your child will benefit from that in the long run .
and it will make .
think so too .
need go ahead and wrap it up
it was really nice talking .
thanks a lot and
to go ahead .
what kind of books do you like to read ?
all kinds of books
also romantic novels and .
believe it or not ,
do so
that from covering to cover
like because there is a little bit of everything in it
of a thing
would like to get into that kind of thing
about how you ?
, like , like you said ,
a lot of bicycling magazines
look at the pictures and stuff , mainly
but they usually have some good articles in it .
but do n't know
any stuff romance type
's more , nonfiction
that a lot of fiction books
not to say , but would n't
.
the last book
me think
tell
read a book in a long time
ca n't even remember really
.
to , say , as
working a lot of hours at work
of course , and then we have a home
known
a lot time 's spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or that type of thing .
have so far , but only
and so are not doing very well
so it 's hard ,
have if
it is real hard ,
a time to look or read them
and that is like myself
relaxing very hobby too
really
and do n't know
in a book
it 's like an for me escape .
do n't know about you
can go by if
look up at the clock say
too would
kind of train your mind .
the habit like
ever read of the book this present darkness
that was
it 's a book fiction
it was one of the best i read ,
it was real good ,
just hurry up and go through
other the problem
have a terrible time getting away from it , too , if
before it and then , it 's time to get up and go to work
of thing
do n't know
, do n't know what you would called
maybe have a problem
is sure it is fast or something
it is terrible ,
really like books you can get into
and that is that .
known
right to bed night sometimes go before
better or something
you
you kind of
that 's true .
have too magazines and
people those things
a success of their lives and .
's along those lines , which was really good ?
give you specific titles
ca n't
in such a long time it
you do know about who was it ?
the heck , what was his name
is
and it was more like ,
it was tapes and things that they have about him , too .
how he started out as just a salesman
and want something for yourself and that type of stuff really
it is up to you what happens in your life .
it 's not someone else ,
you have to do it .
and find that their minds that is that it have one this direction , up just .
and then to do it .
to do it .
, ca n't
is not on something that
are off in all directions
and is
of the wall off .
you want to do this tonight
.
that 's all right .
, known
, known
was more the other way
though you is fun more .
it that way
do n't want to change that part of me
that 's good .
that 's funny ,
there may be some schools you could about read and learn .
that 's true ,
that 's true .
how many people
about twenty .
that 's not bad .
that 's not bad at all .
do you like your job ?
.
more than others
but
.
that is important .
have been there about three years
do you have a family ?
just got
you do like it ?
.
here down .
is too the weather
known
.
so surprise how it happens just
.
have been here up about three
a lot of their cars people have totaled from just hail .
state farm went
the whole situation is bad up here ,
we are having a terrible time with the recession .
it 's not good at all .
things pretty booming down there
to a on the phone on this guy
and he was telling me about it .
they just sold it .
amazing .
that 's good .
at least they kept the business part of it .
is telling you
known
, do n't know
the other part of this thing was , and how do you feel that this influences family .
do what feel
feel like it is important
what you read and to them .
when my children , of course , were younger
what they were grown
have grandchildren and now
read , to a lot them .
that 's good .
all developed kind of an interest in reading
all the right things
a lot of people do n't have at all ,
think it 's important , and
it is because they ca n't read .
from high school , that i work with
across my desk get all the time
and , it 's pretty sad .
it 's unbelievable ,
it is n't ?
a lot of
exactly ,
think that 's why reading is so important , and
n't
so , we were still in college
there is
in handy over the years
also a real
tell me about it .
if you 're on vacation , if it 's just easier to put everything on a card
do n't remember
and it adds up .
up
and it make it easier for bookkeeping a whole lot .
try to as little as possible use them , but really as far as personal life goes
i kind of like having them for gasoline purchases .
we like to keep for emergencies just one on hand .
tried to avoid the national syndrome , credit card of just putting days after days after days everything on there
at counting credit cards
using them
and they got us in trouble ,
and we paid off all them
gas one card , just in case visa ,
but other than that we do n't use them .
every month if you got a bunch of cards , you get
those people and for some strange reason .
, known
is n't ?
concerned not really
, if some of them and then
there is no interest rate ,
the thing off
they come
's and
and they come
then pay , some of the others
but that is the one that your call center manager see every month ,
so , you are a little bit .
you can use for personal use that one ?
you can ?
you can use it like any other card ,
.
those bills to come in
you 're not only the one .
it is
and most of the time is it .
most of
's offers card ,
three card offers from now
, do n't want another one
too
, do n't even much open them
out
do n't want to have to mess with it
credit cards
one of these days it 's going to
that 's not bad .
need one of those
if to do n't say , no annual membership on them they
they started charging annual membership fees , and then
, is not paying you
why do they do that ?
made , , as far as
they got enough .
they 've got enough people out there with cards ,
cards at
there are going to be that much more .
and stuck in my son 's savings account , in his name three hundred dollars , and got my visa card , just
so , as long as they have no annual membership fee , it would
ca n't see paying someone to use their card , but
ca n't either
so .
think you 're right
is the best philosophy
a lot of people in trouble get .
it sure does .
maybe they are counting on that ,
do n't know
is that it
thanks for talking
to you .
do you have what any friends have ?
do have friends that have children ,
what do they say about finding adequate child care and ?
think that may be the key word
think that is correct
they 're relatively nonexistent from my friends .
and it 's just a matter of trust ,
basically and
think sort of goes hand in hand and
so it 's difficult for them .
certainly we found
worked and
but adequate ones was really tough to find .
is sure that 's true
a very mature college student , who want to do and yet is willing to give the time , and the interest to the children
and they loved it .
with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old , up until they were well
pay very well because the parents trusted them
and they have done such a good job .
that 's true ,
and that is something that we are struggling with now .
think it 's just a matter of priorities
it 's a terrible thing when you 're speaking of children in that way , to say
you still have to be realistic , as well
our lives do n't as much
and that is bad to have to admit too
but it 's just , there are so much when you 're talking about two people pressure
continue to be without children
it 's just such a responsibility
take
that 's true
so it 's such a responsibility .
it 's certainly .
of the coin for a moment other the
most of the time
just have to be honest
it 's not always , worth it .
did n't
but it 's funny .
had a friend before we always said said
she got and older
and she said
so why am i waiting ,
it 's just the changes your way attitude
you and mature .
the child care
and they do both have to work .
it 's not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he , as well , a matter
but they need the money .
seen to some of my friends that have taken that week six old baby
you do n't really trust the person or you 're uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care
it 's just a scary thing .
we were lucky when our children , was that age
is that
of safety that
and was leaving them .
but as our children got older , we also learned something from that experience .
all things to all people , or all children
, do n't know
need to increase as the child got older
think that might be part of the problem with some people ,
taking care of a baby , is not an easy thing
and you have to chase them down constantly
is sure that 's a whole ball game new
you do n't since they are both in school
they get in school
that is something altogether different .
one take lessons piano , somewhere on one afternoon
the other one , of course , and ca n't do the same thing .
of course not .
it be else somewhere
and it 's not adequate to sit and wait .
you ca n't do that .
that will do not .
that is out of the question ,
is sure
of course .
but , .
being
what is wrong with you ?
you do n't understand this .
just the way
and it is
that 's amazing .
it must be interesting .
you are a much stronger person than you thought , maybe
is really a nice person
and need it now
regularly to be sure
it stay low and a lot .
what feel coming home after until you and your wife school does get home
absolutely
just a difference in
that 's true .
leads one
and it is
it is the one who need more supervision who has a bad influence on the older or more mature ?
of course .
unfortunate how
you do n't
is living in a dream world ,
what do know .
do n't have kids as
is only an child and
so never have been around children
is so
do hear my friends talk about it , but
we are having such fun ,
were both only children
and we could n't just wait to have so they would be such friends two children .
that are like world war .
do n't know
as a child
did n't
that now , and it is different .
think would n't about it
but .
just make good friends .
have wonderful friends
that 's true
my best friend is one child of ten .
so that pretty well worked out .
about taking anybody because there was always somebody older to deal with them there ,
so i guess , that 's
if you could have a whole bunch just .
have enough .
, by the time
that 's true .
do n't know
all these horror stories on television about child care
and
was seeing something on the television about a little girl that 's been telling her mother these terrible stories earlier
and of course .
and it 's just frightening .
it 's really .
that you do n't understand
and then you really do n't know what happened .
change in the last ten to twenty years
, is at a little bit of a loss
, do n't know
ten years ago ,
a whole lot changed
do n't know
seems to me
is like my parents
the younger generation , gets away with hell
civic freedoms more restricted
may but just
used
where you 'd live
you live at
you did ?
about eight years
have been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live , in fact in the eight years
as you are talking police and stuff like that it is
.
maybe and that has a lot to do with it .
that got worse
there seems to me to be a little bit of a decline in the family values .
that 's true .
that 's true ,
my own personal lifestyle
think there 's more pressure on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be
somebody is at the door .
hang on .
, but do n't know
that 's true ,
it is getting more and more expensive to live .
that 's for sure .
you ca n't make ,
that 's right .
to get a home and buy
a lot of people living in
you do n't buy a house , just
just because they ca n't get into one ,
that 's right .
ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways ,
so .
is that
so are trying to think of anything else that are changed over the last ten or twenty years
it is kind of hard for me ,
do n't know
, do n't know
think the middle class is shrinking , and the lower class is expanding
.
or sooner later that there are going to be a turning around
i hope so ,
at
but do n't
think it 's going to be at the expense of the middle class but
are usually
it 's hard for me say .
'd be one of those who got caught
on the other hand , but there 's a lot of injustice who need to be changed
that 's right .
do you ?
what you do work ?
is in semiconductor
are
is in semiconductor too division
you be with them ,
since you down here
about eight years ,
is over at the center building one
is so
really .
what floor ?
two .
is on the seventh floor
how about that
it is a small world .
so , let 's see
second floor , you work .
probably have seen around him
.
come up
are up there
a d or something
you must know him .
seventh floor
and he gives us all kinds of grief
so can believe
see 's
have been too here about eight years in i guess
, do n't know
,
a lot more too back
lived in the country for several years ,
living in the city 's a whole different social structure and
do n't even know
have n't been up in years there
,
and he 's from that area ,
and he work in over
have n't but
but
he miss it .
he used to go back because he missed it twice or three times a year .
sounds like you
you still have relatives back there
,
had a chance to get back
probably catch them next year
see 's
are long
, do n't know
we ran out ,
my kids probably needing me to go
it 's nice talking .
to you later
grew up on a farm ,
grow up in the farm
have really mixture of suburb and urban living so
,
,
little bit different
think you 're right
it is interesting
work in a high school .
high school ago to
this as an excuse
but it is true .
children do drop out
think that 's right
at night and going out
it did n't occur to nobody to worry anything would happen to me
and you did n't have to lock your door .
some of these
see 's
is not all that long
we 've been having now some problem
and it reminded of that me .
we were living in new jersey .
whereabouts ?
do n't know , though ,
though the news media have those riots out of proportion kind of blown up .
went there many times
saw a riot never
because
what you saw was and what you got .
is telling you
but it is interesting ,
young people now and social pressures
the pressures of drug , is so much
is so much of what is going on so much more serious then when we were younger
think that 's true ,
think that 's true
and worrying about self and not seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
then it 's very difficult to have anything
that 's true .
so many of the problem children
their parents
and you can see exactly , why the child 's that way .
that at home , if you 're not
that 's right .
that 's right .
that 's right .
mixed signals
so it 's not always the school 's systems
it is
then there are so much more ,
it starts , then very much
that too thought
, but do n't know whether they soon be enough and fast
factory jobs so much more sophisticated
that 's right .
it is requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force
and just , some people do n't have it .
some ways it is rather frightening ,
it 's really
be done , in order to flip things back around the way
it 's certainly .
it is sure .
it is sure .
really think they were perfect ten , twenty or thirty years ago
it was a little easier though was n't it ?
the volume makes a big difference , just
think sometimes it 's not so much the kids , as
it 's just the volume of it .
all the things and
i look at my mother 's life
she did n't work ,
she did n't drive for .
her life , and was a lot
children 's lives and was simpler because mother , was there
here and
somebody was there .
that 's right .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
is that
after having a few teenagers when they were teenagers that was the worst time you could go work but believed
is n't that true .
when they are home 's home
that it 's not so much
you there when they need you
that 's true so ,
what at the same time , but it prevents kids from , to try to go pull the wool over your eyes
think that 's true
but that 's
's home in the summers ,
's home with the holidays ,
one is now a senior high school in
is in college , and
but that helped a lot ,
it does ,
have a daughter who had just a second job ,
she needed to work
that 's right .
think that 's really important
do n't think people realize how important it is
that 's true so ,
and it 's not
they 'll come up and make ,
we have yet to make and that choice
, did n't just have to make a lot of women
think that 's right
what was your name again ?
your name and was ?
, talking with you
is going to change ,
talking with you
it 's nice talking , too .
certainly .
think we have a lousy school system
and what do you think that problem is ?
we do n't very well train our teachers
the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents and then put .
not education and then put .
they are social services .
think through quite a bit before
have so some rather strong opinions
that is interesting .
.
and was not very happy with the results
.
if was improve you , so what would you do to improve it ?
would start with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators
with the beginning teachers and the teachers that may have been at a long time it , but have been making the same for a long time mistakes
and then have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers that could benefit from the same sorts of things
pay attention to what 's happening
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that 's the teacher in .
that 's some pretty good ideas .
you do something with those
by a lot of people
you should run for a school board position .
is not so sure about
a lot of
you to do have anything like that ?
anything political ?
my mother was on the board school .
have always
and my mother was on the school board for eight years .
but i guess that are more than some people , less than others .
that 's more than a lot .
would tend to agree with you that there 's a problem
the methods of
believes there 's a basic perception and image problem with the fact of being a teacher even definitely but
with that and of course , you have to pay them accordingly .
would if we paid them more attract to move into the people or more
if you paid more them , and then you 'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them
think that are absolutely right
rewarding people have been doing a lousy job
and it is
it 's hard to tell .
it 's so after the class
if there is some gauge that they could make .
the four years
some certain type of
that 's a very good suggestion .
is enough
and then the student teacher did n't stay but about six weeks .
significant feedback would help the student teacher
that line including
teaching so then , students could watch a class
then to video tape the student teachers also
is that
the classroom electronic whole idea and
do n't think that 's going to work
, especially in the younger years you need have more of the person
are everybody else and then
the two biggest markets
on a wide state basis
.
for a textbook publisher
and all you have to do is
.
is a national problem that they need to address
is
is
me
speaking with you
have
another called line
is that
tell me about your home .
it looks like a little shot , almost gun house .
it 's an older home ,
it 's not new ,
like , though
it 's big .
what kind of square footage ?
, would n't know
ca n't remember ,
is
is that
is that
it is big enough for us , though .
of kind .
we 've got two children .
where so do you live at
that is .
so it 's north .
up here then .
say , down
you have a southern accent ,
that area ,
the way in which people and .
we 're busting walls and things like that out .
is that
you do
we have two ,
we have two .
you do have , then bedroom space enough ?
we 'll have enough bedroom space ,
and then around the shuffle rooms a little bit
that 's kind of like what we 'd like to do .
just a couple months ago we have a baby
and we 've got a den ,
it 's a spare room more or less .
except for chess there to play in
and we need the extra one room .
the living room and kitchen huge
certain just one way , you ca n't rearrange it at all .
what you 're saying there ,
ours is
we 've got two big great windows in our back bathroom .
in there of what you can do
no privacy .
we do n't have ,
we 've got windows at least two on in the house every wall .
'd hate to clean these windows ,
really would
and put in that new ones
and you ca n't really
too
you must too then live in an older home .
,
the house is almost thirty years old .
so it 's not a new home ,
it be seen .
ours
so , by now , most of that is falling apart .
it 's not just horrible ,
came off the wall
covered in tile
and do n't like that at all
that 's awful .
on the floor , the huge one
in that he did it ?
instead of wallpaper
would n't mind if it were tiles short , it
the normal tiles ,
you put around ,
that would be prettier .
floor on the wall
it just do n't look good .
they also are very heavy and
they and so easier to come off a whole lot
one big one
short here and there
have been fortunate
we do n't have enough power ,
our breakers powerful enough to help really with the load in the house
but is our plumbing awful .
off valve that are outside that do n't work ,
and there 's no other real
if something breaks , so we have
and it can be really bizarre .
and we never know
of our house the west
got
, the clock and stuff
but it runs about ten minutes , except for about a month the clock ran normal fast .
the power , and then went off again
lightning or something knocked it out
back up and we
but it runs on fine .
you do have a strange wiring problem there .
he put in ,
are all new wiring
but
he did n't know what he was doing ,
should he really
that is something ,
my husband 's in construction
and he wo n't even .
he 'll do a little things
he says he 'd rather pay the electrician to handle it .
he 'll end up killing himself .
that 's right .
my husband , he 'll change out ,
but that 's about as far as he 'll go .
is that
and he looked around
and he was
a bunch of
, was a what
was the roof
when we moved in , we have no idea how bad it was .
it was a shingle roof wood ,
the first year we were living there , we have to replace the roof .
which
, is it three or five
your husband probably know .
he knows , probably
do n't know what it 's hand off
he told us and it was a completely new roof .
said he did n't know what
he must not of .
we stripped ours off .
doing that it decided it wanted
we have almost about half of the roof , off
and it did this .
a house and full of snow
a house and full of snow , and rain
it came down , and
of the night the
tied down on everything as best thick edge real stuff , we could , just
came from the wind and in
in everything and off just blew it
and we were
woke up and
got up and
had water coming in every light fixture
water coming in
and it filled up my light fixtures , because they are the old kind .
, and would go in
a in the room
and would come on
and the whole thing would be full of water .
and would still come on
it did n't blow up or anything .
lived all
my husband was in the army .
have done something , over
do n't know
was but
and it all went through to her roof
it was coming out of the lights , fixtures and .
the fire alarm went off for some reason .
that will happen .
so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house .
not six feet
but it 's quite a bit , quite a bit
that you know ,
you might well as
did you 've carpets and stuff ?
got ruined ,
pier and beam on
, it got into the floor
the carpeting was already awful anyway ,
your house sound like mine because mine is too pier and beam .
they came in
remove the floor in and
we call the insurance company
the insurance company was paying for the new roof
which was n't really our fault
we 'd done everything we could to keep the weather and stuff out
that 's right .
that 's right .
redo the way it
are
the roof ?
it 's been done for quite some time .
of years we have the last
how long have you lived there
it 's just been at three years .
we have been in the house just the three years .
a lot of
it has
and my husband 's
the walk ?
the home improvements .
he does this for a living ,
it seems to me that is one of the biggest differences the computer revolution .
very clearly can remember ten years
known
so would say that is one of the largest changes at least in my life
have seen that just in the last even five years
my degree was originally in computer technology when
they were getting out with the disks and all that , with the programming cards doing away just
has a job college working thirty years ago
known
those punch cards
in people 's attitudes
very .
is not sure in the last ten years it 's been very different from before
would say the change from black and white to color television even
sure but did n't have access to one
in the way i watching a significant difference
known
watch it then when it is convenient
about being interrupted
can put it on pause just
and you can flip through the commercials
so you do n't have to watch the commercials .
that is always convenient .
the commercials
what was about our question ,
the decline so much was n't .
think they just said the social changes in the united states
's life
ca n't remember that really far back ,
that is certainly , a difference .
that is another one ,
was ten years ago
and had
and they were
all they did was just and make a beeping noise
find to find out and who you were supposed to call in
about the size of two or three pencils
they fit in your pocket shirt and
and display a little screen shows a message you and tells you either a person or a phone number to respond to
those cool
pretty
you can get your messages and still .
see 's
social changes
where do you think it 's going to go in twenty years ?
have n't the slightest idea
, though , is a huge about social change in the last ten years aids
ten years ago
were writing a paper about it
were writing a journal article
and they still did n't even know what caused it or anything .
there was a suspicion , and that it was a virus
have , but
is
what was in your graduate study ?
as an editor and writer
was so ten years ago
see 's
we were just beginning to get into what they were calling the sex revolution after the pill
and up from worries about illegitimate pregnancy
there was no pill thirty years ago .
make a lot of pressure on younger kids today
.
really .
have right now , children and stepchildren kids in college four
was the expectation for them
but , they certainly did n't expect to everybody
acceptable really only if
of think i growing and just kind of some of the changes what will happen
, is , stay flexible because nobody can predict what 's going to happen in twenty years
it ca n't get much worse .
tell you what my kids was likely to be
, them was one of a new brand just baby twenty years
sure would n't have been able to predict for him
and some of the other ones was n't born .
electronic mail
just got on that , about a year ago
because it 's so much easier to get holding of people and get quick answers to things
it 's pretty wild .
,
around ten years ago , was
but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency
, all the time
.
people do seem to travel more .
got off this continent
and my kids both have been abroad when they were still in high school .
and they were thirty years ago we would n't have done that .
every couple months and especially come home .
the biggest thing we 've got going now is probably the robberies
the top two ones that we have and .
about how you ?
actually do n't live in the city ,
'd say that 's roughly right , but probably
the police department would
at if right , probably .
you concerned with as far as security , and that sort of thing in your particular area
now it 's not so bad .
leave my front door
living in the city
a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing
or in the country out
out living in the country
in the country
but it really do n't feel like you 're in the country .
our major crimes in our immediate town 's house probably robberies
is sure they are there , however ,
that 's huge .
are it
it from our neighborhood to
so it still remains city wide , pretty high .
are on why this is happening any theories
would say the majority of it 's happening during the day between ten probably in the morning and three in the afternoon
but why
why it 's happening ?
most families young
both people working
is gone
so would say that 's their prime motivation probably
they 'll stock your house and look at your pattern and then go from there .
they are so professionals ?
most of them as professionals
that sort of stuff .
very few pence ante stuff
think can be done to reduce that sort of crime ?
the police force , for one ,
think they could add to the police force and the type equipment they use definitely
thirty thousand about people
officers that patrol for that amount of people who are very many not only eight
it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to make simply ,
you increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit
the real question is how do you convinced people not to commit such crimes in the first place .
overcrowding we have the prison
they are giving the early release , so
doing in that , too
what they need to do is
you think so that would be a deterrent
that would be a deterrent certainly .
what about an innocent person who
think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty in a lot of cases
you 'd rather see harder to convict somebody so it .
'd rather see a little bit it harder and have a little bit more evidence to convict somebody
, and and then especially reach the life sentences and death penalties and follow through with that
in the case of murder especially
and the individuals , got caught
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
you did sue him under the civil system ?
do what now ?
you did sue him under the civil system ?
is not real familiar with that
you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something
the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him
they said he had no job , and
he had nothing ,
he that you could go after
makes you wish that .
they give the guy a job in prison
they do n't do that here .
they pay ,
you or the insurance companies
that is too bad .
and , right now , they are reluctant to go after him because they are repeat offenders
before they be in jail ,
they 've been released .
three major crimes and car theft on
think that 's ,
and the guy gets in two months out
that 's awful .
and and
back in jail now fact , he is .
what deterrent does he really have ?
have actually
other people will wait up and wait for somebody else to do something
course it does n't always work out in their favor .
and saying that you ca n't arrest all of us ,
you can get some of us ,
you ca n't get all of us .
and we are beginning to see more and more of that .
you think the home owner might be armed
break here in
are you and
of the night the
and help for it
just another different set of people come in , but then
so readily read in the newspapers
it 's not many from the local communities .
but it 's a problem ,
need the court systems
would be a definite deterrent
the police agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over
agree with you
there is no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it
is one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence
their constitutional rights and .
just , and we just do n't protect them .
known in my wife 's case , they made
, known
think that 's ridiculous and
offer anything that
just moved here recently
and we bought ago this house about year and a half .
a basic bedroom three
lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and historic houses and things like that old
new plumbing , new wiring , wallpaper , paint
house have you
would say
did really enjoy it ,
my mind to it
.
have done something like that too extensive nearly as
something to a basic ranch , style home
it is .
it is .
that 's true .
he were living in an apartment at the time when
the market was so good ,
had n't
you can get things for such a song .
so , that 's why we ended up in a house like this really .
have to have my hands into stuff after
and is always
maybe you can make and make ,
is that
new carpet and everything
so we 'll see how much longer we 're here .
talking about as far as
'll and tell you that we have kind of a charming house
almost three years
considered a full time job and it
it is ,
,
the things that
one thing that might be a good for you suggestion even
old estate sales
just a little frame white house just a little estate
all the men and started going down to the barn .
is that
is going to the barn , too
they auctioned some tools , things like that ,
work ,
bricks in his , for days pickup truck and so .
but , were what we ended up with about four thousand .
a deck on the back of that house
and , it was quite large into the yard
something .
of it to the ends of the house either
how fun .
nice how
he did the digging , which was about six inches , and
and placed all the most bricks
i bet
and satisfaction to know what you did it in such an inexpensive way .
it killed nearly me .
let
when you , lay those bricks
know a house about ten years ago
they sell it again and again move
's like
and they have to be doing something constantly .
little these bugs sand
the weeds come up in between the bricks and things like that
every bit of
we laid about as close as you can get them , but those bricks
.
of four of sand inches a
and then we swept in between sand ,
an eighth left of
you just put together as close as you can them .
as you can .
we 're going to have and tell everybody
we 're going to pull up all the bricks ,
but they have n't just brought themselves to do it .
the thing that is funny is that they 've done things like that ,
catch her out there
it and then is , in two days like time they 'll come home from work
little those things and back .
it 's just , they are the most resilient little characters
and do n't know what they 're finally going to do so
hopefully they 'll sell the house and go somewhere else .
take to the extension agent and
wo n't and then she
these things
what it 's
and they are
that 's true .
that 's true .
my dad farms but
spray in the field , you can get out
it might do it ,
she 's got a gorgeous just yard , so many flowers and four her cats ,
real about what she sprays
, known
went through at that other house in so long
have been so busy
but do n't know
and thought that would be the hardest thing to do
had just a ball with it ,
it was so much fun .
good .
up and down
and was the one thing she ended up with the door , which was on the front door of that house old
she had in that and up
is going to find a house to put on that door before she does
as far , so that 's my plan .
you do have any particular thoughts about the school system ?
with a hundred percent there you .
's care of everything and
providing sports extracurricular activities or something maybe it 's got
it is interesting
of people yesterday a
many parents wo n't even when recognize that there 's a problem
and they 'll say , my kid ,
anything about this before
had time there
n't these parents , knows that teachers talk
we do check with other teachers , and
the same things in this child and .
and how the coffee , .
but it 's a problem ,
and are not sure just how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it
as , is care about the situation with their child 's
that 's right .
the biggest effect of the children crack in the school system
born with low deficit attention
and what 's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system .
that 's really scary .
of areas where the school system can improve , a
and this is
and they are not in fact .
they are problems behavior .
skills children have to master skills really
that 's not and their problem .
we have an international population .
they got
, some sort of transition for that
the school systems in
the behavior problems in the average classes and
average students
motivated bright , maybe
but they are
because you 've got a mixed bag such there really .
these very intelligent people
an awful lot than me
mine was good ,
but they were n't great .
just to get my degree in the field and was
in high school was
but they got in college motivated
and they did a lot better .
i guess kids do too mature at different ages .
you try and as a teacher
kids
just a question of maturity , got a kid
or is a problem child he .
we 're
we 're
got or , if they are flashing lots of money around
the school system , to be asked to do so much so
but you ca n't operate in a vacuum .
a student with
what could possibly .
it is for drug use .
they ca n't
it 's amazing ,
all sorts of things in the schools
to the kid who has a behavioral change suddenly ,
to the nursing
and you have to find out whether there is a legitimate reason , or whether this is a warning signal .
there 's a problem that we should be aware of ?
was sitting in the shop barber
, is an officer in the air force
were having my hair cut and
was there from his son 's school
his son 's in high school .
but this guy was there is no problem with my kid .
my kid is a great kid and all this .
had the kid
was his answer permission to miss
the denial mechanism is really strong
by their children
have been fortunate
and other my son , is a senior high school in
and they 're really
and we 've been very fortunate ,
have , but
do help their kid , in some ways , at
you have to say , but at .
and through not any fault of the effort of the school system
but it was good talking with you .
it was good talking too .
you connected with the schools
have on several subjects not just this but the different things interesting conversations
to have some interesting conversations it 's amazing
that none of the ideas or thoughts being used at all
, though
that 's true .
listen ,
luck .
take care
quite a
and they are
a lot of
estate sales , which takes up a lot of time to
what does mostly do you ?
a lot of sports
a lot of things with my family as much as possible .
that should be fun .
fun for them
old how
got a little girl 's six and a little girl 's three
think that 's better than having that party at home
this is a friend 's party
so they are looking forward to it .
what a help that is .
that not long
but , we needed to get back to our parents older .
very much
did
we came east .
so he is working then there
he is doing quite a bit of consulting work
just after all , these years of working
think she is a temporary worker
.
the word spread in this part of the country a little bit
.
more than
four , five different people to
what 's her name ?
have n't
the call was probably for her .
so we put in .
said , but we 're getting the kids ready to go to the party birthday ,
to one or two
so , that is interesting .
that what sports
is probably basketball
it during the summer months occupies quite a bit of my , time .
in play in a tournament or something on a weekend
but usually , my family goes with me .
we try to do everything we can together .
think that are too easy for a , family entertainment ,
is the team i play , usually on with the tournaments and stuff
and they have my kids age .
, so pretty well together
under the stands
under the , bleachers
much .
kind of
it 's like getting together with , them .
is getting , a little hot
speak so
we really have any kind of real heat
think it 's going to be enough warm this afternoon ,
so , it looks like an air conditioner , days .
it sure does .
maybe this evening or .
is sure you are familiar with that living , here , but
very , so much .
up , so , .
it does n't .
have seen , the signing somewhere
sure you have .
an awful lot of people know
until everything happened , it was a very wealthy self-sufficient town , for a long time
fell out
it is beginning to do well .
there 's a lot of time old wealth that there
something like .
and you really like , it there ?
about that area so
have been there never
it 's pretty , .
they say , but it 's pretty , sure .
is the weather
we have so many wonderful days .
it your standards change
it really do .
a lot rains there
but , you get .
all the time it 's like a fine mist
it where it does n't gets .
that 's the way it was , there , too .
need go
have and
talking to you , too
it was
much .
thank you .
through that birthday party
live through it .
, too
that 's what i hope .
a lot .
together based on what you have time
where they are not together spending time
in my situation is off been doing his thing all day today ,
and have been doing my thing all day off
newly
two years
same situation here ,
about ten months
known
he is a record collector and a hot wheels collector .
that 's wild .
so he was off looking at records today .
was doing type household things off laundry and
and did
look back
thought .
think that would be the ideal situation ,
think that would be the ideal situation
shift work in .
do n't have that choice
same here
hour , at a certain hour
and it 's not flexible .
be able to have
might find a job that have flexible hours and maybe
i hope so anyway .
but do n't know
it 's really kind of sad ,
to school during the day
they would be at work
, a lot of families have to have dual income
a lot of people to , which is fine
kind of
like , back in the old days back when
and the mom raised the kids
was in junior high school
that was nice and
and like that
would be able to my kids to give that
do n't think it 's going to be realistic
known
unfortunately , that is probably true .
quality time with their kids
quality time
watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff like that .
most kids see that
it is always that way until it is too late .
until they 're older
look back and then .
it is true .
they have some other questions
is not sure
my parents growing up
we did n't really have one .
and they spent a lot of time outside with us , and stuff ,
but my dad have his own business
and it was easier for them to do that ,
, but do n't know
at the time it was
that 's a good way to put it .
not a very good one at that and
that 's a pretty good way to put it .
if you have kids , what kind of things to do hope to do you
be able to teach them right from wrong , of course ,
i work
a lot of
a lot of volunteer work
in the community
a lot of things with their kids ordinarily that they would n't be able to do if they were working and .
and 'd like to be able to do that
'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids
work , to be in clubs and stuff
.
i hope that happens , in my case .
but think that 's for the few and far between
and do n't really see ,
if anything , i think , there are going to be fewer and fewer income single families .
known
what day care about to be really all
have never that kind of experience
do n't even remember them being around when we were little
it seems like that 's a big trend in the last ten years .
it 's like a home away from home for a lot of them .
all of our ideas
we agree
a good closing
it was really nice talking .
you too
wish you the best
too you
there .
tell me ,
some of the things that you did when they were growing up with your children
parks and of that sort things to
had and two boys
in both things like model rockets
would go to the field football
also have two boys
a reason for being there , especially as they got older
always so we were at together .
that 's good .
mine was not
but neither one of them on the sports after that carried .
the boys tried those ,
when they were seven and eight ,
and they really loved it ,
one is in college ,
, and will continue
and they 're fortunate ,
even they made .
!
that 's great !
and whenever it was reasonably close ,
but , we did a lot of things ,
do things together and with the children
we would go in for the museums always so .
that 's always a big thing .
one of my children and is also a musician
and other my child 's big into tropical fishing ,
we take family trips to different places
they were interested in a lot of things ,
quite that depth , i guess but
a fish store on the entire coast northeast of the united states
in fact , it 's funny ,
we would go to the beach , when they were younger
so we did try ,
of course , too , and we learned .
and do n't know ,
did not work when they were
started working half-time when they were at the nursery school
started working part-time when they were in junior high school and high school , and
and , in the school system worked
a full school days
that leaves on holidays and summers me , but off .
think they need you in different ways
that 's true ,
you want to be around for the crisis and things like that ,
that 's right .
that 's for sure .
that 's for sure ,
any feelings as
are with so many women more choosing professional careers
and do n't think it needs to be the mothers ,
think , but it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few hours more
it was funny ,
can remember ,
from school how important it was when
it was n't really conversation ,
but there was always things that just tumbled out .
when it is not there .
think that 's true ,
my boys did n't even when share all that much with me ,
certainly not to the extent
that
but it 's funny ,
they do n't always do it ,
occasionally , but
and there are when
them or they and at least .
who would they ask ?
that 's right .
or what would they do ?
that is exactly right .
but it 's
grew up in a situation where we always on weekends was visiting relatives
did too
every weekend there were somewhere
it 's not
we close to both sets of grandparents
they saw them , and a lot
but they do n't have any cousins ,
they , or did n't
about younger ten years
so they never played or anything together .
only two of them and
and they did n't live in the same town .
take up the families
that 's right .
in some ways the kids suffering , in a little bit
so we try to as well as we can do it .
close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone
we and
it 's not
, that 's what a family 's like ,
make everyone
it seems , but there should be some continuity ,
's family traditions , and that sort of thing and
always been a little bit of a tradition that we have
this year , it was hard with our son now being in college .
this was so one thing that we were n't able to do this year ,
that from the time the children were young until our older son went to college away enough to realize what it was
that 's the kind of thing that they will remember , though .
and you put it on the tree ,
you have so at a decorated tree .
we threw it way last year .
nice how
today and look as new as they did when she gave them to us
and there 's a ring
you buy and
.
the present up
how
is sure that he appreciated !
and it was fun ,
but that 's a tradition
married and left and .
you was saying what other trends
and that 's the trend in a lot of lower class areas , for the grandmothers to be raising the children .
is a lot of it
the broken families and
it is , not only raising her own children , but raising too , frequently children from the streets and grandmother figure that
the symptoms , it 's not
it 's a rite of passage .
's most of it in the afternoon
the local news and the , both national news
are pretty much
is a graduate student
for school a lot
are all the time reading so much
really just sitting down and watching a news broadcast and .
you can get up and leave that always .
that 's true .
just do n't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper
by already , it 's time for the news on to come .
that 's right ,
so , it 's so much easier to sit there
can be doing things other
that 's right ,
.
is watching the news
the same thing
think they did a great job
thought , so too
for all the time we saw it .
was really good and
and you always could find some channel that have something on
but you did n't necessarily have all the time to watch the same thing .
just news ,
that 's right ,
they do have monitors television
that 's great .
of the day the
that 's really good .
, used to watch
is a teacher college
the evening
'll so miss the evening news
really the way i look at the news
we do n't get it either ,
out living in the country
and we just do n't have .
we 'd watch the weather stations and sometimes .
is that
watched it for half an hour
and then you could go on to do what else you wanted to do .
very little
do n't even get a regular newspaper
living only about a mile from
, do n't really listen to the radio
n't
so 's television my new main source .
is in a van pool ,
and is in the two hours a day van
to work to
in the morning and try to sleep because it is dark
try to read in the afternoon , but
can pay attention , not to what our driver is doing so
a lot here from some of the outer areas
that is necessary .
have two kids over there
c area
one work for the state department
and her husband 's in the navy
it is funny ,
there is an hour , less than between the two that only
things like property values
the more expensive it is and .
a little bit better
it is
that 's an interesting perspective .
the area hometown
it is funny ,
you can watch different news .
it was just a big recently thing
heard about that
she 's big in the democratic party
that 's good , so
so she had good national ties ,
but she was also something like a state auditor or something like that before this position .
she was a state auditor ,
and then she left that to get a position with the democratic party
now she ran for mayor , and
and she is cleaning house
for a lot of the people there
is a difficult process to get rid of a bad mayor
both of my kids , did n't want to live anywhere around the downtown areas
they moved both out way .
one other the lives
it 's a nice area .
they have to drive a little bit ,
might they
do they pool car in ?
they driven by themselves
because he 's got fairly regular hours since he came back ,
had she
active duty
have n't so
, do n't know what the situation is
they did n't called for mother 's day you ?
we were gone .
you were n't home ?
we were n't home
and left a message on our recorder
had from all my kids except for one , but that
that 's good .
we should stop now
for called
enjoyed it
people from all over the united states to
so
different political views
enjoyed it really
one part of
the wider world
.
a lot , thanks
.
thank you ,
, only to have been here for the last ten years
from
'd like to visit
a little bit too , unfortunately ,
is that
was grade age school
my husband right after the second world war took a tour bicycle about five months
lots of pictures of the beautiful , spots , areas , and
is not in physical shape for something like that ,
has an opportunity like that
.
is that
.
so , we like to go to dive resorts both .
we and there .
but , we were n't able to get people enough together for the trip .
we could n't get people enough to go together , and
it ended up so falling through .
we were going to get a really good price .
what we 've never really
little bit of
much of anything else , but not .
my husband
to the ocean or something like that
be the water
when we were in jersey , we used to go down to the beach jersey a lot
they have , a beach really nice areas there .
there for seven years
.
because the mountains , were close real
that 's a really pretty area , too .
the white mountains
unfortunately and did n't really
went
we loved the new jersey area , too , because the lakes , was pretty really close
not so much ?
not really much .
is sure
you have any children ?
.
we all the time , had little children
some of the things adaptable ,
it 's a little more , difficult planning a vacation , when you have children .
it is .
figure out kinds of things you can do that
especially for small children
now is one thing that happens to vacation trips that usually who try to involve some of the members of the family
somebody is , that
that was fun , and so
camp for a week with as many members of a reunion rather large group as we can get together
that sounds like a lot of fun .
our family had a reunion last year was kind of like that , too ,
that there were several hundred people
met at a central place and
, did n't go
but it would have been a nice vacation .
move around enough so that we have now people in different parts of the country
, but maybe a pickup
is really nice
so you could sometimes of sleep in it ,
but would n't you want to do it all the time .
we have enough friends , here and there
my dad been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel
are he
he 's in his sixties ,
to get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country
the rest of the country
he does that quite a bit .
n't lately , because he 's been ill , though
but he 's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time
and he 'll say , this is my itinerary .
is going here and here , here
'll be back in about two months and
that 's for sure .
have n't
only the states
you be to a lot of the historical different sites
believe it was
about three kids
but that was a really fun , interesting trip .
and , so we were
it was really interesting .
, when we have kids and then eventually
his folks did a lot of traveling across country .
but , even some little ones do pretty good
they can help , but when
to cut costs , that is a way fun
and it is enjoyable , too .
is fine , as long as
's with you
need my comforts creature , too
it was great to talk .
see you later .
do you vote
,
i try and vote in every single election .
every one
about six years
really did n't pay any attention at all before
that 's me .
any attention to
you have n't
, did n't use to
get angry about what goes on so
unless you have something to do with it .
but that 's the problem
ever have so and hardly anybody who won that i vote for
liberal
by what do you
liberal politically
do n't know anything about politics
n't
there 's a lot of them ,
it depends on what issue you are talking about .
it is kind of hard to say , especially after storm desert now ,
they were more .
and is how much that holds true anymore ,
.
government less involvement
they are less apt to vote in more aid to people , and so
they are the government or more .
you ever voted at have all ?
have never
you have n't
old how
do n't know that much about it
do n't keep up on it
have enough on it to pick the right person knowledge
that 's what they need , so
said they
if they could make easier to find out what 's going on it .
you do
think it was that woman ,
a woman it was n't .
did n't he , have a woman
vice president for
that was
that was a couple elections ago ,
is that
n't
but they are all saying they 're going to do what is best for their campaign anyway .
, do n't know
they did n't teach you about the government , not really in school .
you did n't get any government classes ?
it 's really too hard ,
in
in
they do n't take any stands on anything .
they kind of
so that it 's hard to tell where they are really it or on certain issues
know
with the abortion issues and stuff
they 've kind of to take a standing on some things , like abortion and things like that ,
that is so kind of , how i judge .
, like abortion or gun control , say they
or , let me see
newspaper articles but can
what makes them look good anyway
they do n't want known
everybody 's
did n't have much knowledge
is that
do n't even remember this being on there
what would it take ,
good , actually talk
incentive ?
so what kind of stuff would you like them that would you know more about it .
send in the mail stuff or have it at the library
that would be good ,
is sure they 've got it at the library
get to the library if
have got two babies ,
do you ?
that will tie you down a little bit .
but do n't know
or do you feel like it 's not
if it would make , if people stopped thinking like that
a lot of people , they 'll vote their votes family the way ,
my family
we 're really independent .
all
a lot of families but .
like a lot of wives feel that their husbands vote
from getting a lot of issues resolved
i lie
, do n't know
would probably vote more , if
think he was good looking , not
but , he was young .
because that was right
what ,
he had an affair ,
just it and .
a lot of people and
you got turmoil in your personal life
think everybody , do
it just depend on how well you can hide it .
that 's very true ,
or something like that
otherwise .
running for president
you do
it 's all secretive so ,
we do n't really anyway see the true person .
that 's right .
turning it into a contest popularity by
you say yes or no on
and then maybe if to do n't say yes or no they
are saying
and they make it a personal thing
that 's about what it looked like .
just thought he was really inept
do n't think he did anything at all
just kind of up like a puppet there
think that was part of it ,
the economic problems that the country , were having at the time , and the recession and stuff
thought he was great
you did ?
always liked him ,
he was great at the time
believe that he got
see 's
that 's been about ten years ago ?
liked him and
you did ?
have lately you heard stuff about him ,
do you know what he is doing ?
n't sure
he 's still really politically active .
he 's been overseas .
quite a
here for six years
and , you can hold on
is
other the line
doing it for
living in an apartment
it is , there
on hold .
that
you 're
they have here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only facilities .
now and maybe about two years
have
they do n't have that option
have out here
there was n't any really good way up until this just last year ,
but not all that many ,
it was n't
recently the refuse department is working we put in for recycling these other things , but
so it should be good ,
think about it
they also have of all white paper and of cans recycling there also
a little box at my desk
just right in there
because at work is an excellent idea
is that
that 's right .
one of the things that need to happen
would agree with that
a few things but not very much
think that 's a shame and
they need do a little more ,
'd like to know , for instance ,
to or not there is some reason
what they ca n't use
do n't know
are doing because that would be helpful really
with you there
their aluminum cans is for children 's hospital , for a burnt fund
that 's great .
that gives , you a little bit of incentive there .
would have them drop their cans off in my office and
saving them for you
the children 's hospital fund
think that 's , right
us be enthusiastic about it , helping us maybe using the money for something more
go there .
making sure
that 's for sure .
of what it 's you 're doing more , you understand
would think they would be coming out with more ,
is
think it 's getting more advertisement
people becoming more conscience that all the time
think that 's true
that 's about my some on recycling
enjoyed but
did too
you do now have any pets ?
i
we just got a new addition to the family , and
we have a fish also .
it 's a dog mud .
it 's a dog mud .
did
the mud dog
you did catch the fishing ?
we have a friend give it to us .
and it 's all in that aquarium alone .
we get him a friend
have n't but
so how about you ,
you do have any pets ?
at the present time have two dogs
what kind ?
that 's the white dog with the feathers
has liver spots and
and that 's
have a wonderful female lab , black lab and
how long have you have them .
probably five or six years
most what we 've ever had
and it is in that breeding .
, do n't know
is that right ?
is not sure that 's the situation ,
are
had no idea ,
did n't even know that
but she is
the symptoms
he 's got a bad back
but he 's seven ,
he is almost eight years old
he does n't like to roll over .
jump just , as long as
had just wonderful luck with this lab
see 's
winter before last we would bring her in when it was cold .
the next morning
i bet
my son 's roommate college , is a vet
's give her some shots horse race
into people with problems
he gave of this dog , so
's and
anyway , it 's a series of six shots , once a week
do you have to give those ?
, could have
but ca n't
believe me ,
i
and she was after significantly better .
then did n't
but many people in this part of the country not know about .
have
never really used
heard either
and it is
also are he an inside dog ,
or does he just run out in the backyard ?
we are now living in an area where we are in the woods
and we take
them go away from me
take through the woods twice a day , but we
that 's nice .
can do it on her and over
but at least anyway , she can go
tell me about your cat .
and we took him in
and he is about two years old now
love and he
let 's see , and
he 's outside
he 's got a way to get in and ,
we like to keep open
go in and out
of course .
that 's nice ,
he go out
and he 'll tell you which one he wants .
he 's been through obedience school .
been
, you have n't you
it is
have some neighbors across the field ,
just wanted
never let them get away ,
but now every couple weeks , one would slip away
noticed those dogs
they come anytime .
made that so
we talking five minutes
's for sure not
is not either ,
maybe we have ,
your for pleasure pets
have you ever done before this ?
have n't
put in the paper work
just never made
when the time is up
n't
when we started at the clock
think it 's been probably about five and a half minutes or something and
but was talking
i love
she did , and too
and and after about twelve minutes or something came on
you know at least
but it 's been so too much talk fun .
how did you get into this
.
and would enjoy it
that 's true .
do you work .
.
probably home and just got .
also men and .
was going to tell you the same thing
they really are looking for a lot more men to participate .
my husband do .
does he .
've got some applications ,
need hand them out
but this is a great project , that they are working on
and it 's really going to lead the way for a lot of applications and development in the area voice .
think so too
helped particularly out on men
not make dinner time around
try to make during the day ,
but nobody 's home .
this is the perfect time for me .
maybe 'll get next time you
so much it fun to talk to you .
have a good one
you too
you do use credit cards ?
not very often .
are the ones that we use visa
of the month the
so it does n't get the credit ,
you need use that policy if you 're going to use credit cards
otherwise , up paying so much more for your merchandise that it 's not a very good idea
that 's right .
do you have a lot of credit cards ?
have a lot of them
but do n't use them very much , though
mostly for big things like .
on and on
which is
a lot of people
they going to have it in a month
that 's true .
they make of the mistake , pushing all their cards .
times , which it 's very useful , like emergency trip or something
the money will be available ,
but it 's not immediately handy .
think they are very helpful ,
plus the fact that it 's not to have to carry a lot of sometimes money .
but you do really need to be very responsible about it
or end up in deep trouble .
first got a job
it took me
so are not going to use them at all , and try to pay for everything cash just after
that and worked
we got and then
so if we decided .
that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances .
you from doing a lot of things
that 's true ,
they become a very vital part of our monetary system , over the last few years
but it is true ,
you have to be very careful
or end up
an awful lot of people and .
he makes and calls to what people have
very every night because the world , has so many problems of that sort
and it takes mature people to treat it ,
so that it is , instead of a disadvantage a real advantage to you
the tax system was
did n't do you now any good
you can not write off your interest .
before because it was n't even though probably
do n't have much on credit cards too
it 's good to talk to you .
too
for called
now .
do you exercise .
sure .
what do you do ?
work with free weights out
i love to ride a bicycle
right near rock white lake
try to ride , about a day to miles twenty ten
have n't been doing so well this year
that 's good .
a bike for
have gotten that day some sun , and when
it was
that 's weird .
that was wild .
, but do n't exercise now
had just a baby three months ago ,
have n't really got back into exercising
of years a
it was three nights a week
and it was running three nights a week .
what 's your motivation ?
what is my motivation ?
always me of mine
she would , and push
, she , let 's go do it
and she would n't take for an answer .
, or , look good
wanted to look good , just
it was n't really
it was just a side benefit .
is not big or anything ,
, but is not in great shape
got in pretty good shape , but when
did n't build up
just got
do n't think women look good with muscles
up
up
what was the other question ,
see 's
do you do it as a task
or do you enjoy working out .
sometimes enjoy it
just get tired of it
have been doing it
should keep up so
you do n't want to lose yourself .
some days it is the hardest thing in
old how
you 're still young so .
still , young
getting older
all
not going to look as bad if your body is
seen an old woman
and she looked good so ,
she was standing just as straight and tall
she did n't have that at all .
her lips , was a little bit wide
back in her time , they liked
so she may be keeping that on purpose ,
age as bad ,
go too at night
those kind of things you more age .
smoking
just kind of it
smoking
a pack a day
hill fast going down
ca n't
have tried
a friend of
ca n't
, have tried
just ca n't do it
was pregnant ,
had them , but right back to it as soon
right back to them
the only reason
did n't want to
and do n't
.
, have very few vices
'll keep this one
thank you .
but did you go to one of those health clubs or anything ever ?
went to health club a few years ago ,
do n't have time to get down to one
alone work out
, like to work out
need competition
have somebody to compete with
or do n't want to do anything
would n't mind working with a friend and stuff out
stand waiting and you just
and get out of there
are
get your girlfriend with you to work out
a lot of women like .
'd love it if my husband would ask me to work with him out
he does n't work out very often .
he do n't need to , course .
he is small
and he work as a laborer on the railroad .
so he is building his muscles up all day ,
he does n't have to do anything .
he can eat like a horse , too .
he and do n't
you have to .
you can gain weight too much .
too much , gained a little bit
did with little my first boy gain
loose until two years
and and then got pregnant
just have to start all over
as this time because
got pregnant with him ,
was n't just in shape
do n't know the difference
about weight ?
and fitness working out
exercise .
look good and stay in shape
it is good for me ,
that 's what my friend did .
developing and everything
what is it ?
steroids .
steroids
there are really
was
was
hormones .
hormones
steroids .
i stay from that crap
it 's too dangerous .
hair start
has a friend whose brother did steroids
just he and out as soon as he stopped working out .
to all
, he just looked really bad
did n't know it did that
do n't know if it does , to everybody
that 's just how it affected him .
have been wanting to get me a bike , but
have been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around
scared to run , for dogs
dogs , can get on a too bike you
at least that way to run out a chance
do n't like to run myself
several times about it
to move faster a little
they came up that are running not as good as they thought for you
would think that it would be hard on your legs and your joints and stuff
it 's real hard on your legs
and it 's hard on women .
and it just makes stuff move down .
like , but
do n't mind that
can get out and do that , as long as it is not hot
if it is hot , you ca n't do that .
but i love run in the rain
be careful to slide , not just
you ca n't ride your bike at all in the rain
you ca n't ,
it is dangerous .
slide .
maybe some of these mountain bikes you could at least
do n't know
can do in my car ,
tried to do it on that speed ten
told her and a dog was chasing me
into the curb
did n't hurt it too bad
think she had some kind of thing fender
but .
anyway , it 's been nice talking to you .
good luck with the new kid
thank you ,
she is good .
have
planning to do you
it 's a house rent and
so decided
buying some magazines and stuff
what would be interesting .
never have done any of those fancy kinds of treatments painting ,
but they look very interesting
with them some beautiful effects and .
have got in both the bathrooms yellow tile
that together
is going to put in there wood
that should be nice .
so it 's going to have kind of a country look .
as far as what kind of painting to buy
do n't have an actual instruction book
so are really in kind of the beginning stages right now
it 's going to be a big experiment .
you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you
because you might find it is beyond what you 're willing to put into it .
have n't ever
sure but did
several houses
never the outside .
.
what kind of painting do you normally use ?
with the rollers the walls and ceilings
one of our bathroom has only a window in it
so are hoping that it wo n't be too much of a problem
or try to strip it
is planning on taking it off
and it took forever .
would not
if it are really old , you do n't know what it 's put on with .
it 's hard to tell ,
so it may be the original wallpaper .
, could be
if it should .
it 's paper it will probably
it 's probably paper , in one bathroom
it is
was
this was too in a bathroom .
the wallpaper in that bathroom and had a black background
for a bathroom an odd
it was awful ,
it was
we have a party dinner and before we started renovating it
and went in there
, and is not quite really sure
off more than
'd say to tackle project first one and see how it goes
if you like it and then you can always .
probably be the easier because it would be just of the two
it would n't be any kind of special effects type thing .
it would be just plain painting .
ahead of time
and it can be done a whole lot faster .
they are
they dry and fast
if you have some help .
if , it will do that .
it should be fine , if you take it up the next day .
it get dry , but not just real hard
that 's the problem .
come up easier if a lot
of using it
use good stuff and buy at a painting store where they have the right brands , but that will go down and come up easily .
all the helpful tips
my project a lot
wish you very good luck with it
the painted business
was my kitchen cabinets
decided and
hire
'd if you were closer
was closer
hope your project turns out great
we 'll see how it goes ,
flat over it
that 's other of paint the advantage of course .
is put on another coat if
we 'd go because our time look better
need go to the dentist ,
thank you .
most of my news in headlines from the radio
in a different fashion about
that it had a national edition , now .
like them
but they take so long .
do n't always have time
it 's a whole show hour .
actually , it 's an hour show each evening ,
dinner and .
we start dinner around six and finish it up
travel even a great deal overseas
is it and
do n't believe
but it 's coverage .
was abroad , until the war gulf
and they seemed to have the best coverage .
they have more information than , most of the other networks .
think he reported what he saw
if you did n't like it , and that was just too bad .
that you should .
.
that 's right ,
think so .
and do n't read ,
was younger ,
more on the local paper
, from the world
that and the radio but
.
's from the peninsula ,
what is that ,
it 's horrible .
and that 's a terrible paper .
that 's pretty good ?
what is that ,
the chronicle is n't it ?
there are the chronicle and the examiner ,
probably the worse papers
you can get there up the l a paper ?
that 's a pretty decent paper
we can ,
but do n't like it
that is one another i read ,
forgot that
the wall street journal
their articles be getting longer and longer even
that two columns on
they do n't have enough time

pretty woman was kind of a light comedy and a romance ,
and this one was a lot more dramatic .

sort of .
it was a mystery .
wanted to see where she was at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something
it came out in the theater .

we 've been wanting to see both it .
it was weird .
a different movie from

and they marked or something off routes that they could go .
that would be kind of hard for us ,
we 've got bathroom one , only
we 've got two bathrooms
my house kind of looks like two trailers put .
and is one bathroom
and is one
so we could do it .
that would n't be too bad .
and he could climb out the window .
every room leads to three rooms ,
to get around .
you can get around .
you ca n't go out the door honey front , just
you did see fatal attraction ?
that is coming back , on too .
and that 's how it kind of bothered you , the way it ended and stuff kind of in a way
that 's kind of how was of the roses war .
parts of of the roses war were funny
other times it was like it , but then was
it left with and you just .
,
or want to see , though , it
have
wanted to see that
but do n't know what it 's about

or some part of school
in the school

so long since been
it fly through the air .
he save the land from some , ooze
but it 's really good ,
do n't think so
did n't see that
you did n't see
that was cute ,
that was a good one .
do so
a lot of times we 'll go to rent a movie or something and
and you 're not sure whether
told me last night she got naked gun
and she said .
saw that we
and they are coming out with a sequel to it .
two and a half
it was funny .
want to see that
she said it was real good
and working girl is really good .
that
that was good .
was
that one night by myself
were alone home
did
, did
that just reminded of that me .
you did like it ?
is just a little bit different than typical , so
think they are a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way
it 's a brick house , and with some wood .
it 's real nice ,
like
about how you ?
certainly hope so .
ranch style
live on as a ranch
it started life as a house bedroom three out
most of the houses in your bedroom three area , two bath
almost a hundred percent .
ours is probably
if it could be a house five bedroom ,
do n't need a closet
can pick just out
because it 's all different builders up here .
so it 's at kind of hard .
but the one thing , my house is a little bit different
can pick it again out because it 's not typical , and
a double ceiling , high double half in one of the house
and is the kitchen
, the family room and the living room
the space and .
walked into this one
, again , but it 's
you can just because the roof is so much higher spot them .
about it in that sense , of the roofs high
those and .
he can walk
and he 's six foot .
says up mom and
are not going up there
are not going up there ,
he says , but there are plenty of room for a room up there .
knock out in my family room the wall
's , but not
to someday when up there
mostly with some wood brick
but it 's all brick basically .
of me the other
but the one on they 's total brick
almost all three , two
they are all three , two .
a little river going down
, better than us
little fountains in
that 's nice .
and was the ones who come with the rains
and they did n't pay any attention to banks , and that kind of stuff .
you 're in two inches of water
it 's a third of an acre .
do n't think that 's a lot ,
about sizes lot out here
and the two acre being what most people have
there is almost when no lot line at all .
are they
that 's true .
, known
taking care of things
it 's not comfortable as a living for me .
feet twelve between
more on
, but is like you
look here out my back yard
and can see the gate
the fence , is right there
just do n't run too fast ,
or you 'll hit it
and are not
could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me ,
the swimming pool in your back yard
your back yard
little a place on
is not to me , but they
they are going up , but
from that aspect , you 're right .
take it by hand that kind of stuff
but
are used to walking out the back yard
catch across the back yard
and you 've got plenty of room even to play a small game of baseball ,
but do n't do it around here , .
started looking
and it just seemed like there was a thousand drop for each city ten dollar .
about it that way
but , we went that way .
it was the schools and the cost of houses ,
where we need the traffic , time to get into work ,
and that is where we stopped .
it was the same problem .
all you both ?
this is a wonderful thing that you 're doing here still helping them out .
was but
have no problems so
but would like to move out of a house four bedroom and go with something smaller personally as far as the housing
do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there ?
quite , actually
is the inner pollution in the city
and it 's just surrounding the city ,
and you can see it actually .
they are
they are even dark ,
and is what it 's the pollution .
what do you think of the greenhouse effect that 's going on ?
that is causing the hole in the ozone .
that 's very serious .
we are feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the stream jet even .
, it is n't it
the last two years , our winters
one snow , .
should know
but n't
is
and we 'd have three and four feet of snow .
they do n't know what 's snow .
is that
real
old how
twenty seven .
forgot almost my age
we are the same age .
all the time
is so that
think it 's just something that goes with the territory
just laugh .
,
traffic and slows down to nothing .
actually , they 've been doing the same thing here .
it is kind of funny ,
is
, do n't know
you get used to the weather , just
are , of they and not
, do n't know
i just laugh
they have every time , on snow .
and you can
that 's true .
you do all have much pollution there ?
not really ,
not to see it .
and there 's a few factories ,
but do n't see much pollution going on
driving down the road
and you have that black smoke coming .
they have a test or something like that .
cut down on it
that supposedly is
'll what tell you , but
and even these buses it .
buses school and the commercial buses
buses school
that diesel fuel is what it 's
and it gets bad .
the tail pipes being at
above other cars on the road
that 's a good idea .
really do make it , and
although it , settles
and it 's a lot of black smoke
that is , if , and even more miserable .
the pregnant women supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoking fumes
did n't know that
was pregnant with little my first boy
, were walking back and forth
not back and forth ,
and were having to walk along the highway
it was just one days a week .
, have no sense of smell
could n't so
but it would make me sick ,
just from walking along the highway anyway
that 's bad .
all the
that was four years ago
now it 's probably a lot worse .
is sure
even normal people ,
it 'll pass out , and
and it is
you do smoke ?
it was kind of funny .
and they were just screening some candidates ,
ever 'd do that ,
was just one of those
you do smoke one a day
in between people
so that kind of threw them off .
for the air pollution
for ozone , that and
they are real big into it .
and they 're doing just a lot of stuff .
do n't hear much about it down here
but we 've got that air coming in off the coast too .
blow it up
maybe so , that is part of the reason it 's not so bad down here
but
they have mainly just when it gets real , real hot warnings here , which it is
that 's kind of good to know ,
for most everybody that
especially , it is usually for the young children and older people old .
it 's a big change .
it is ?
and they 've got the mountains , the beach , the trees , here
, rivers , ponds
it 's really pretty here .
it is ?
in a lot of parts ,
?
close then live .
real
go there
where
you visit them
they 've got trees ,
is going to have to get some
have one
my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago .
you do smoke ?
.
do you ?
.
you did when you was pregnant smoke ?
did
could n't make myself quit
did cut down a lot
can understand that , actually
have got one vice
and smoking is it .
do n't
do very little , and
their morals , their values and everything
is down here at the belt bible
got down here ,
in this research
and he got me into it .
.
how you 'd get into it ?
and so they told me about this project .
it is fun ,
like talking to new people
, have been interrupted by my little girl and
had hang up and stuff
it but .
, like you said
,
my husband was in the service ,
and his family 's down here .
now we are out of the service .
i bet you are glad .
.
have two children ,
have a year old , and three a year old seven
try to spend time as much as possible with them
that 's good .
what kind of things do you do ?
a lot of things with them
or is my oldest in school
and so she has a lot of programs and things like that school .
a big change in your life , have a child , it was .
it 's nice really ,
my husband is working most of the time .
he is working long hours ,
are staying home , but
are working just a month a couple days ,
what do you do during those days ?
a lot of time at the playground
to the zoo
you said you worked though a month a couple days
what do you do ?
is a nurse
are
he is now really just starting to get interested in a lot of things ,
understand that
especially at that early age
she worked part-time when my oldest was little
now she is staying home all the time , and
that really well worked out , but because it 's a big transition to have children
to go from nothing
every night , is fine
but it does n't work that way anymore , when you have children
that 's right ,
a lot of people
still so many people who have their careers first but
think it 's really hurting the kids , and
with you
my wife lean
and is really glad she did
is glad she is staying home , and
some days when she wish she was back
, known
like to work a couple days ,
think it gives me a break
is glad my wife did , too
that got out of the house and her
most of the time at home ,
we like that started out
think that was really ideal and
to
,
because when you start having two of them , but then it is a little tougher bit
it is difficult ,
here forever
from
eight years or so here
that explains it does n't it .
, do n't know
a lot of things on the weekends together
during the week , it is usually
what is
he work for coca cola .
he manages a plant out here ,
and it takes a lot of time .
is sure it does
and try to fill our days with things like that ,
is perfectly capable of doing it for them ,
but , it 's so much easier to go to mom ,
they get
but we 'd go to the library and do things like that ,
that 's good ,
that 's good .
and he work about an hour and a half away from our home ,
so it takes him a little bit of time .
and not be able to work because of that during the week
was working in the evening ,
he was coming home and
could go to work , and
just the time that they were spending together ,
think it helped really have together that time
it really do
think
had he been around children ,
he has seven other brothers and sisters ,
so there 's a lot of in the family kids
and he really enjoy it .
but it is right now kind of a difficult time ,
and the cost of living is just so outrageous tremendously here .
it is difficult to do it any other way .
i
you 're not getting to spend as much time at home , then
spend time at home as much as he 'd want
that 's right .
that 's a tough situation ,
who along too you to do got to get
consider myself just at least
my wife normally feel that way ,
are
, says take and she
is getting out
known
have enough during those days
known
a lot of people ca n't afford to get by on just one salary
think so to a decline in families and family values and
.
and we need do something about ,
but do n't know what
that too
they need really focus on the children in this country .
of years a
even really think about it that much ,
aware of it
but it was n't really important to me that ,
your whole focus on changes life after you have a child
it really do ,
forming the mind
in the next year or so , you 'll see so many instances where he 'll mimic something that you 've done ,
and , he is learning from .
that 's right .
that 's how they 're developing their patterns .
a lot of people , do n't care or do n't realize it and .
just it in the back of their mind or .
.
it is true .
, known
think it becomes part of you too ,
you stay home
it 's not just for him ,
you are there , too , both kind of bonding together
that 's true .
it 's been nice talking .
it 's nice talking , too .
luck .
time more than
'll tell you , so
it is a serious problem ?
do believe it is a serious problem
solutions to it
if a third of the people are shift workers , they wo n't be able to get to the polls in any case .
on the weekends
but that is one of my solutions .
a really high improvement and not do think they 've seen .
vote
you have to go pick up the ballot
it is
perhaps a problem
and we are the mobile society ,
one out of every seven people move every year .
are their voice
think that 's the biggest one
that is the biggest problem .
two books
stars and stripes of them
it 's a fairly decent book .
it is preceded by several other books by these guys .
and other what the books , was
a definite trend toward candidates use
it is the only way that you can use effectively television .
do n't understand that
such a low opinion of
would rather hear something negative about the guy other than a positive factor
if , will people believe it .
if , there must be some truth to the matter .
he did refute it .
he refuted it ,
he did n't believe anybody would believe that .
his trend and indeed started upward .
did n't believe anybody would believe that either
.
then how a democracy can work then ?
do n't know
how it can work ?
it is working ?
that 's the question .
everybody seems
my solution to part of this is to make it an economic incentive for people to vote .
what ?
a certain amount
of that about how the
if we just severely limited the campaigns money so what was n't so much of an issue
like , if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count
but the idea is
it is for them ,
anybody listens no think
and these days .
the special interest groups
they do not promise anything specific these days .
but whatever you just .
my lips read .
no new taxes and
but he is
because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget
why did he then say that during his campaign ?
he promised the best he could .
and he is the president
he should address those problems and
what was so funny is it happened so rapidly .
he knew it .
he knew it actually .
being associated with government , and he should .
maybe he will and .
we be the cradle of liberty and all that
voters motivated
the other countries that you were talking about
because it 's going to be totally different ,
do not think
just , it got more violent every year .
about their inability that their voting does count any way not so
everybody is now available .
,
was disqualified
or that is just the truth ?
think there 's a higher percentage in black certain areas of voters
think in this sort of conversation only we can do our own reaction .
they have this huge fighting going over redistricting here .
they took another vote on it , and at
and not the minorities could get enough .
and this is something that have been going on for months .
it was every night on the news .
they have lawsuits over it
it was a major issue ,
and still there was n't
on something there
what do you mean ?
why ,
you did not press one ?
did press one ,
but that 's the time up by this time they usually tell
do not know
do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed
out they and generally
known now in some states in some cases
no some juries and longer
as small as six people in minor felonies and misdemeanor trials
but is a reflection of then what 's happening in the real world really ?
if they keep giving everybody year hundred sentences ,
think that 's what 's happening
save the people from having
that might be it .
, not the people can afford it
indeed the present overcrowding conditions and .
jail waiting for trial
so
you might be right about that .
do not know ,
only about percent of the cases ten come for trial anyway
the very
or end with the jury actually making the verdict up
with a conviction ?
that most of it is through
most of plea
but how do you feel about the jury system itself ?
do you think that should be changed ?
my friends up for duty jury
most of it was robberies or things like that ,
it was not serious any crimes .
apparently so any felony even for the smallest crimes
they give the person the option for a jury .
criminal trials with the jury on
of some sort of
to of a long time
do not know ,
with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire system trial
read that there is a shortage of judges
they wo n't appoint them not
but there is no budget for them , i guess .
that go with them , and the bailiffs and the court clerks and the courthouse .
.
do not
would replace it
do not
, known
are looking
for not .
do not know ,
they do not just care any more .
so many people in prison and yet .
it doubled in the last ten years
,
our population grown some too
and see and understand ever
could handle prison
it would be very difficult ,
related things drug type
there must be a very great degree of that .
do not know if the jury system
would think
of jurors after the trial the
television cameras and newspaper reporters before how they reached that decision
there 's a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that
, known
was there actually during the trial ,
was true of me and
it 's a picture was not good enough .
we want to see ,
do not know what they wanted honestly
do not know
being , when he was certainly
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out
felt that way
but it does not matter .
the guy was guilty obviously .
always in the situation .
the jurors
one count .
, but not do know
make a judgment on somebody
the prosecutors and
as the media maybe the evidence was not as sensational
that might be it .
is getting a call coming in
with you .
it been nice talking
thank you .
real good with
so we went to a place called quality auto parts
are and
and they are very reasonable , .
we put on the car
it did n't work , and
up right .
it was just the part , just did n't fit the car
took it back
and he put it on the little thing he had there to test them in
, again put on
it did n't work , and still
we , and took the car up to a little place called pep boys
do n't know if you have them in your area
but they also are pretty reasonable car repair place .
but there is little some difference just what causes it not to work ,
they probably built in that so they could make .
so
and that was my last experience .
a little right device in
an air conditioner
do n't
there is a piece on through the belts , fits metal
and that somehow broke off
still ca n't figure out how it broke , and
have too many problems with my car
just basic maintenance and oil changes and then
do not do my changes oil and
will not do my changes oil and
somebody else 's
did this and
bought everything ,
and then to go to the trouble
shy away from the oil changes , as far as any maintenance on my car
that 's for sure .
had any trouble with until that it
and now the car has a hundred and thirty something
this was just recent , and
ca n't really so complain about this one
how did you put that many miles on it , four or five years ?
for about three years and that did
it added really and up .
and the rest of it it 's just basically driving a long ways to work
is getting little relief , so
a long ways
.
do you ?
for what we are doing right now ,
you want to call
fake point things
points .
about getting the cash and just
there is
who to make the same number
that number
and , or another they 'll give you an option to leave a message somehow
you can and leave a message .
someone did , that
a message
and they 'll call you back .
that 's good to know .
called in a long time
and have n't been doing it
have done it maybe twelve times and
, have done it quite that much
mine , but is mixed , too , up
and
's
bought , but it used
just bought it from a friend that charged just what the dealer , was going to give him for it for a trade-in me
and it had a whole lot of miles on it .
'd get one or two years out of it ,
of good years out of it a
and he took the engine apart
and he just said he could n't fix it
the engine never got so
, do n't know
the body was in good condition
and it ran fine .
it was starting to burn some oil .
you do n't see cars like that just .
they last and a long time .
and they were too simple ,
was the engines
will buy some people , and still
it is still easy to find for those cars , engines and transmissions engines
guess and if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time .
almost it cost so much to fix anything or to do with it anything you 're better off just buying another car
guess so
but just think they cost too much in the first place , now a days
my voice ?
and lawn care
, known
we about to hit , few minutes it in
it over with
and trim edge and
and that 's all we 've been doing all weekend .
you know
we doing it here forever
it was up to your shoulder in thistles probably .
that was all that was there .
have since then probably ripped out half and
the plants or do not make the winter time .
you do
just two ,
so it seems like a lot more .
old how
four and five .
four and five .
do not know if that counts and
you do not have to tend to him .
did for many years
you did .
it 's over with .
he is gone .
it 's over with .
back
but not .
will get out there and pull my weeds
do not have a big real front yard
have half of it is a flower bed , by the porch all but
because the porch , are pretty big
living in town .
nuts out of me that just drives just
do not like it
bought some plants and stuff me
and just through the whole nine yards .
got up everything
broke off just so them all
you ever had seen those ?
they pretty in the spring
do not like them , but
because that is a bulb .
it 's a bulb .
the whole thing out
the plant in the spring
those pink flowers
they just pretty
and put some other plants down
the first year
me tell you
they do not come back at all very well .
will maybe they
that much further
bulbs maybe hundred six around
of everything
they do come back next year
they will ?
and , everybody down here called the irises i guess .
them flags
that 's what they call them down here .
not sure
, now in the spring
and ?
they come in all different colors .
one of them and only to get
per bulb
one big flower look
not know

you know what i bet you
?
is a pretty good gardener and
a lot of things here

it do fit
and it 's a bulb .
do not really know

the same time
not much care for them
and it looks like a bunch of leaves just to me .
took them out of my front yard , but
went out there this spring ,
took on right where they were
they told me and to kill the hardest things .
they real easy to grow
that help ?
is sure what it 's not
they say irises .
them flags but down here .
do know what it 's not
is getting just into gardening this year
you did move just down here ?
we moved here a year ago .
last spring
we moved in this house , may of last year .

i work for the air force
so , there is
that is interesting concept .
are
your on in your way i d
the access
is that
ten about months ago we moved here .
out of the city

that makes it bad for getting out during a fire .
it really do .
a little bit
do not know ,

a criminal justice
so do not know what can be done
do not know ,
think it 's getting worse
went home , but
and a group of five or six guys went

they were young men .
known
a thousand bucks
unless they stole it .
that 's big one thing and down here .
not all young and .
it is sometimes
and they ca n't still catch them .
it is getting worse
do not know what the world 's
and they said he was twelve years old ,
known
do not know
wonder where he got it ?
the air force
do not just think a lot of people need both work , but
a lot of parents that involved any more
there all the time
to their own devices a lot
discipline .
do not know how your folks , was
my parents were
and was
and it was sort of like there were boundaries .
do not know , and
a lot of parents
definitely so
they learning boundaries
it in place work
do not
a little bit but .
, but is in my thirties
say
but that 's just what it 's .
it 's an attitude like something the world owes them .
too that in the air force
do you ?
since a lot of us
you in the air force
is in the air force
get people outside the air force and so
all it is worth .
and is
and the air force is one of the military better experiences .
it is .
it a lot
me pardon ?
it so far
you going to be a person career
do not talk , but
probably .
but they pay for my college .
that 's the way to do it .
do not know ,
an aerobics class or something to
you supposed to feel safe
it does not matter ,
these guys jump in your leotards there standing around watching you
do not even think that way , and
nobody can think it ca n't happen to them .
or no matter .
and you never know who is watching , either .
do not know ,
this morning were in the grocery store
and it 's about seven hours .
we never had been there .
that 's a very , very neat town to visit .
but the crime is so bad there .
in all the tourist brochures .
to carry your wallet
do not even .
it 's not worth it .
was in the super market this morning
on the cover of time magazine , and there 's a girl ,
she is on the east coast somewhere .
attractive young real girl
freshman , coed college .
think she is a freshman
a for several weeks
and rape date .
she looked
it was just sad really .
did not pick up it and read ,
but should have
, what a world
known
you ca n't trust anybody .
, do not have
it 's really scary .
you ca n't really .
and they have a big real thing here .
dry cleaners soliciting
everybody want your kind of thing business .
very different in terms of that
and he opened the door .
and was
and got probably
and about people getting blown away
and it 's not a reason .
you should not deny yourself going to visit and all that .
but it 's not any worse .
have been in
so would say one thing
would not want to go by myself
do not know , but
could go on and on about what to do about criminals
is not real big on guns myself
our system justice needs
of years it seems like a
are
but ,
that is a way to put it ,
are
and it 's just a real big deal here .
they doing it again
is not real up on a lot of things news
just you but
it 's a lot of crime repeat .
are
they should have been in there longer .
known
, not have been out that long
it been at least ten years
, you were it bad back then
think , television , like you said ?
that more people think there 's excitement in it
to the edge
they wanted to see what it was like to kill .
they picked so on .
was going to miss him anyway ,
that 's horrible .
how can you think like that even ?
is n't it something ?
and all those sort of things
their brains out and
for the sneakers
the jackets , the team or
the dollar jackets hundred
probably one of
videotape themselves
how do you feel about it ?
much the same way
right now have two kids
one 's two and a half
one 's nine months and
that age , of course
nice with others and that sort of thing
and now we went through this with our children
is not a good athlete
was able to help the coach in controlling just the kids , if nothing else ,
and our children and our grandchildren do things that they might not be able to otherwise
, is to get out and see and do things
we 've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area , and
have been there
have seen and that
that 's the type ,
in the books to the kids
because we went everywhere .
could what they said , when it was we need raise quickly because this place gets very cold very soon food and
have gone
, did n't do all those things type
with my children to do things like that a special effort and so made .
it 's a very important thing to be done
or ca n't feel they can spend time with you ,
there 's a lot of people out there and that you do n't want your nowadays .
think it was in the sixth grade ,
they write a brief little autobiography of themselves and about what they have done and what they wanted to do ,
very when he wanted to have a family and be able to help my son wrote
of pride with me a real
that 's nice .
because so that 's home .
the wife and say you need something to do ,
talking to a guy on the phone
we 're kind of far apart here .
heard about here on this ,
it looked like it could make and when .
likewise now and then
we like to get support from other companies as well .
is an accountant presently working
work out of a job myself
but , it 's been roughly an interesting nine months here ,
again , and this is our home area .
we enjoy living here .
it is where we started out , originally
back up about two hundred miles away
is now
it 's been a pleasure talking .
thank you .
i live right on the ocean
but the major cause here is the car pollution .
we do n't have much too industrial pollution .
can put my finger on here really
the situation transportation and is such that all the car pollution is absolutely awful .
have been reading
that is so ?
did n't know that
always and that 's about
most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution .
would think so
about all types of pollution
just read the other day
another one or rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere and now .
is so
it is air conditioning units
and certainly , we turned
you know like here .
is n't
i guess refrigerators and .
.
that 's right .
you do get , getting people
this is
it is in the sense human rights ,
really demanding that we can spend so much money on certain things but that research but
converter ,
no leading gas and come to the pumps .
and that 's been done .
there is the leading pollution
and think
we certainly do n't even need a research anymore .
it 's just a matter of passing the law ,
passing the law depend on how heavy is the lobby automobile and .
that 's right .
make and
and in buses .
that 's right .
that 's right .
do n't know if you got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus ever ,
that 's the smell awful
the other day actually have less pollutants in them than fumes gasoline , diesel fumes
was sitting there
but of course just to get even in the
we have taken the intermediate step
fossil fuels but .
went on for years
it was going to be
throw out with the baby
to us for years
fossil fuel enough left or there is n't ,
with the issue pollution is the way to go anyway , but not
have so
but it 's something that 's a little frightening
have two sons ,
just this area and .
the mentality
that 's right .
that 's the way we will be going so .
far the west on
that the other day
but it 's
the stiff fairly laws
but did n't that without a crisis occur again .
nothing will occur without a crisis .
is no the smoking rules , on airplanes , and in restaurants
for me to do n't think that , a pleasure
but that was pollution , to me ,
that 's personal air pollution .
its most personal , pollution
that
listen
speaking with you
and let 's hope
something happen .
thank you .
you are welcome .
gone crazy up and down up and down
now it 's
, do n't live in a house
living in an apartment .
you in a house
can do
now has a lot more than the one amenities
this one gave us free cable and ceiling fans
and it was
and the carpet was new
it is a story just two building .
a lot of buildings but
but it 's just two stories .
so you have all one floor to yourself ?
the rooms nice and large
see 's
that 's nice .
but they did n't provide it .
, did n't have a place to put them
and that 's
that 's nice .
always have been pretty lucky
the real estate out here 's been pretty good .
down the prices last year
just before it never happened .
so it 's everybody .
all the developers do n't know what to do .
it 's a good time to buy , if you 're in the market .
we 've actually our house on the market because we have two kids
and we have a house bedroom three .
and it is filled up pretty much right now .
a bigger one
get an extra bedroom or a basement
with the whole apartment the third floor and then .
and they have a basement ,
and they , finished the basement
and they were able to rent out also that .
at a lot of them
was thinking about coming down there ,
and that 's what he said that people who had down there were it was n't just something .
on pools and garages , but no basements
have yet to see a basement in a house
maybe it 's all the sand .
always think it 's like a desert ,
do n't know
do n't see that kind of sand here
just a little bit , some more than others or .
but you have to know the spot right , pick where that does n't happen .
inches four
had a basement in they and so
.
that 's right .
it 's sort of really unusual .
my folks used to live there .
back before , they lived there .
things like that truly different from area to area
but that 's the same way out here
that 's why we came out here .
but it is considered the country since it is far that out .
but
.
down around the corner from here
and it is
land got so expensive
they just ca n't afford to have housing like that low income .
in an area by itself your house is ?
we 're in a development .
it 's not connected to another one ?
there is a quarter acre another one away rather .
but they are not ?
you have to stay in one single family home .
i sort of got
when we were kids my folks have
got a single family home and so as soon as we could
and that 's
go here .
you did push one ?
have n't
started doing this just
so do n't know too much about it
just sort of
wanted to see if you have an opinion about this , just
'll press one just so if then
that will be fine .
a totally different type of
thought and
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours .
think we should just leave them alone
need to settle its own differences within itself
that 's the course that they should go , and
maybe we can help them a little bit , prompt them ,
but do n't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on
had nothing to do with them the other thing is also our idea of democracy and
this is too general , and maybe
democracy the same way
as to do n't understand we
do n't think that 's the way to go in this
and that 's a couple thoughts on it .
maybe you express something here
think that 's overall that right
think it 's kind of sad though , that , for generations
somewhere someone in there are going to have to learn a different way .
we do have completely different ways of looking ,
think there 's a lot of good that can do , as far as example the united states ; and other countries at the same time , but
think some different things could come and
we could be a catalyst for their change
has the war
and do n't think we 'd be talking unless there have been a war
that was one thing , which came out of it , good or bad
any war as
it 's just a war .
, and do n't see
dead bodies
is
just think you 're right , but
of them a whole different
, tell them to go to their room
and that 's going to solve the whole problem .
it 's going to be them ,
but , is that
they do n't understand any other way .
at that , and you have so too ,
that 's true too ,
anything else than what we did
violence
there was nothing else .
violent leaders , to ,
look at the leader they had .
it has a lot to do with their religion .
known only because from personal experience , and
cab different drivers in
every
a totally different life than
the western world it sort of
and they have very basic life ,
it 's just a very basic life
is what is sad
that and .
and it is always been military
it 's been , and always
and that 's been always the way of the world .
the majority of the people over there
, compared to the people
a lot of people to do n't follow
good people and .
and
it really just come down ,
that 's right .
does n't
political boundaries
boundaries man
is so much of it
that 's true .
stay in line for four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor
's sort of mixed on this
one setup ,
.
prices and that way able to reduce because it 's all centralized one thing they
picking the major portion of your health insurance
was the other day listening on the radio
they could make , provide health insurance to people who could n't afford just by the money they would save it .
we 're
do n't know what the total cost of the program is
they 're probably picking up about half of it .
that 's a pretty good policy , and
and they are fairly expensive .
paid a month
but it is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care
, did n't like it
kind of really did
my wife decided that she wanted to stay with that doctor , so
so , we went to the medical insurance that we have at work here ,
the doctor that you like it 's not a problem
do n't want to have to be told
normally but really if it does n't make much difference
that 's right .
then , and we did find several good doctors .
and like you say it 's five dollars an office visit .
and my wife was in the hospital
think and her total bill was three for everything hundred dollars around
delivery room , and everything
little that she had to pay
was but
and have you come in
five dollars a
care of a problem
liked it really
both did
out forms to pay for reimbursement all and eight
just right then you pay the five dollars
and then you are done with it .
again the doctor 's practices in hospitals but here .
you take a hospital , the physical plant itself
eight of that the story operating building
the costs out over the patient all costs
into the hospital for a week , and it being , a thousand dollar four bill
they are taking the cost of people who ca n't pay up .
they get a lot of there
they 're not going to get money
they have to absorb somewhere else it , so .
three in
their insurance plan that they are under and encourage you to shorten your stay in the hospital .
she went and , in
she had the baby
and she was out in two days time .
almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital ,
the deductibles did n't apply .
will then we if you 'll shorten your stay
your last vacation ?
we went home to visit family .
it was n't actually .
we took a cruise
and we went to different four islands
we have a great time .
we were there for ten days .
where have you been so ?
have been lots of places
that one would count ,
that was about a year and a half ago ,
my husband 's
, have n't been there yet
it 's a fairly vacation place for french people to go common and actually
they and
that sense easier to be just a little bit
and it just seemed like it would be a place to go fun .
so we did n't really have enough time .
it was
we have about less than two weeks , a little bit .
as always , and it seems
a lot of traveling around
and we drove pretty much everywhere
it was hot ?
some of the days in fact we froze .
, do n't remember which
but was very young
so do n't remember that
and when we moved back here , was three
that is too bad
so do n't remember
but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been ,
was a baby
because of the world that area would be great .
it was a very interesting vacation .
and we have
and we have in pockets inside and jacket underneath a coat type of thing in things .
they make all their money on tourism
if to want to buy you
and get really after it
it is too when they are coming up , and they are all over you
the other cities it was n't as bad nearly and
of them it , was a
what we did in some of the other cities are to hire a local guide
it does n't matter who is it
everyone else and away from you .
and it is worth it
and it is ten dollars a day or something
doing that
we did it , but
we were much happier , and
also to see if you were alone , you get in and
that 's great .
where have you been else ?
and so we 'll get to travel a little bit too hopefully .
lots of wildlife ?
it 's a fabulous vacation if you like .
if it 's probably not of interest .
and just have
and incredible
and be so close ,
was that when
when you were there ?
a lot of my travel
actually did n't
.
did n't get to the great barrier reef
it is gorgeous , gorgeous absolutely .
the coastline was just incredible .
it 's huge .
it 's really ?
do n't think so
food
that too
were traveling by myself in a car ,
it would have been much more fun to do it , with a bunch of people in the van .
you went by yourself .
was by myself in china , too , and
china was a little bit more of a challenge .
but , because it was n't more of a challenge in a sense
so much got out by myself or not , and never
it was very expensive ?
maybe it was about a thousand dollars , maybe for ten days including my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare all a little bit less
but it cost only you about a thousand dollars to go there
it 's just a train ride .
of other things a
all for a thousand dollars ?
that really
around a thousand
of the hotels line the
they were all completely clean ,
was and
you ca n't stay in the cheap stuff
that way go
with this woman going
and she just gave me to contact this woman 's name
and it would be fun , really
think with two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
was used to having guns around the place
middle liberal of
have quite a collection myself
and is a good hunter
was twelve years old
of course , my parents made
and do n't want to see them completely ban guns
but do n't want to turn loose either completely them
that .
what 's going to find a knife , a rock , a stick , who is it to commit
responsible about use of guns
we can handle it
but there is an element that ca n't .
have to carry automatic weapons
everybody 's in drug trafficking got them
you know .
it 's not sure .
it was n't really gun control
you have to register as a gun owner ,
have n't
but you have to have this card ,
you have in order to buy ammunition it
this was twenty years ago .
they control in that respect it a little bit
rifles too bad
and bought a pistol there
that 's not a bad idea .
think can make a waiting period
it is .
kind of weird
ought if
we 're getting into now capital punishment .
it would be control gun definitely .
again the purpose of gun control 's control how it is being used is what the purpose should be
not to keep people from buying a gun : need one for a specific purpose , legal purpose , but to keep the guy who are illegal is it from getting his hands on one
and is in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands
.
and they 're actually a necessity in life .
not everybody needs a gun
need one but sooner
did in the service
, so do n't really need one in the
you do n't have to carry one in your car or your pocket all the time .
mine for recreation
enjoyed and my guns
have a good time with them
, known
them how to shoot a gun
the same thing ,
she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have
, not have an arsenal or anything
but we have several guns around the house
if they do n't get back up .
've got a year old now six
now
have taken time to teach them
the young boy now and wants to know
and , you are a little bit young for a gun .
me go out here
we would start with the gun b b deal , and
started with the gun b b
took it away from him , and
now , said
so he is learning the hard way
it was my mother 's uncle ,
was probably about twelve at the time , and
and he showed me
know how to use one
and have some guy blow me away ,
think we agreed pretty well on this
think so .
real talking
have a good one
advanced reported methods , with computers and other devices
statistics more
that 's right ,
those in turn statistics got and bigger them budgets .
the overwhelming data seems to be available that there 's a lot more violent crime indeed
especially more where
was going to say ,
a lot of business here
here quite often
that 's a sort of media perception and again
your attention grabs
it just makes
with little success , even though quite a bit of money and other planning efforts went into that
think is causing all this ,
crime sure does seem to be in intensity and violence , too , increasing , though .
have three theories about it three things
have one theory ,
bring by two things
on television , and the movies
and are not just talking about role models of tough guys and gangsters and things like that ,
show some sort of violence to settle the argument
is an advocate of control gun hand to some degree , and then
, not have seen that
think about it ,
think about it ,
do not know ,
your views
it seems anymore a movie can not be considered good unless there is just some sort of violence or something in it .
and then you start making a movie
and there 's no called for something violent ,
in there to say they have it just something
is that
it just when we have this sort of violence in society , feeds upon itself
people to it
spend money on something like that
is sure it does form role models for young men and young women and
those things did not happen in that manner before television .
and have to think that it had some influence on it
do not
really coming down on him because of just some of the things he believed in
said he and
in discipline
they confused with punishment discipline
, if you have this type of a moral stance on you people come down
everybody be free to do their own thing
and
think that 's really contributing to high this rate of crime and
that so much of a return to prison
are that and not
now , that 's a crime and since .
it does not
, do not mean attachment and responsibility
nobody feel responsibility to do something .
it is i wish they would stop doing that .
that 's right .
the changes come simply by statutory nature .
do not know what really it will take
's sort of an advocate of having free speech
and would be contrary to my beliefs in that
a higher for something of that sort
the sacrifice and is not that great .
thought and
think that is correct
and
and it seems
citing just that
we 've got a lot of that influence .
this is really peculiar ,
most of the cook husbands
the wives during the day get
they do n't care about gourmet stuff really ,
but it was the guys that got together and did all this .
that 's nice .
my husband just , he really really like
to all guys and barbecue .
, is telling you
really but he does
and because you ca n't knock that it 's a good thing .
all these guys other but too
and so we 've got together
just these really elaborate gourmet meals and .
and it 's really , really kind of a neat thing to do .
how often do you meet ?
try
because everybody is so active with their kids and all that .
it 's like if we can do it once every six months , we 're doing well .
and did n't have much so stuff with the kids going on
we tried to do it every other month , then
but it 's just lately been once every six months .
that is much more reasonable .
in a club where we tried to really do gourmet meals
and think we were a little bit
do n't remember if we were
it or anyway was difficult .
by the time we got around to each of us , and it was time again , so we were
it 's too rich .
it is absolutely .
while we enjoyed the evening the next day
one of the couples and then moved
and we sort of , so did n't continue it
when your children start taking up you say
sometimes and that means
that 's true .
we have a friend gourmet that ca n't stand fishing and
one of my friends do n't eat any cheese at all .
because so that 's a real problem .
take that back
she ca n't eat some cream cheese .
really that but
in mind , so we try to keep all
have recipes
, is the gourmet
so they would
but it is fun .
to cook a stock and three days to make it took us four days ,
and all you get
but you 're right .
it 's very , very rich
because it 's quite a treat
it 's really .
sounds
you like food but
just the community of food and .
it is
, too , .
and what to do that you can do
and did a cop out on to it
are buying cold cuts
have to make ,
providing
and have to make
for the main thing it 's going to be sandwiches figured so
go there .
so is buying the tiny little rolls , and so on
but ca n't do it working full-time
and , it 's just too much .
known
those that people try to do everything
would n't be nice that
of the whole thing a
do n't know
but it 's really kind of a neat thing .
a kick out of it
really .
everything , all parts of the food
really much people and .
.
as good as what you can make yourself
think so .
or if , it is extremely expensive .
just got back from a shopping trip purchase in the cold cuts
and never have been there before
the foods and .
go there .
but was
and they have cherry black forest cake and all those things .
commercial bakery not
they and in that made in their homes
it 's so kind of interesting ,
you want to pay the price
it is .
bakeries around weight here
just like that
smelling just the air
but do n't know
on little strange details of food , i guess
this is
that is a party really good time
just it and down here .
hot food too
all the stuff goes with that ,
is not
that there was a slight difference in accent .
'll
in fact , it came just to mind ,
tell me about china cry
.
her dad was a doctor
and he was well in the old regime to do rather
everybody was back to a commonality of one .
are leaving out a portion
very high up in her class
being a child
they kept on at her and on ,
in the meantime , and she and her husband were expecting their own child .
the people and kept harassing her over a period of months
and finally carried out her into the courtyard really either to shoot her or go through the motions of shooting her or by firing squad executing her
she is
she is not going to die
her life and .
this frightened and the commandant
he called and this kind of stuff off and so just put in the labor camp .
child rocks around
him and in .
of course , and she had walk .
they besides the clothes on her back stripped of everything her .
so she went across the border to her husband and other child that they 'd have already to freedom .
they knew that she was n't going to come back , and
she did , years later , but when the liberalization of china , happened
and she was not persecuted or anything else like that .
interesting story
it was .
very moving
seeing that advertised n't
and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly .
that recent
.
it has large press release .
sort of
had this great desire to go see
and , we ended up going to see green card .
green card ?
green card
and he chose it
,
so she was a horticulturist ,
that was and sort of her dream .
,
they got of course
never again and they saw
except fate through them together
so they have to get back together and get their stories straight ,
but there were no proof that he was really .
he 'd been working when they met in a restaurant .
learn basically in a weekend
just then .
that they would fall in love .
they fell , at any rate
on the last one said he
taxes too high
quite a good value for
what do you think ?
think so .
and think we need raise either our taxes or cutback on something
to get that settled .
at this stage it is
's real , out of it in terms of taxes
think so .
known
and it is up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house .
but now we 're getting public services , the schools , the hospitals
is what the schools could cost and if it was n't for the taxes
then again here is the community college system excellent for the dollar
be among the lowest in the country
know which one it is down down there
, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
think that 's right
that would provide some possibly relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things .
the so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes such as that and
tax people out
, do n't know about that
ten years ago
so could n't afford to start again
.
that would be true .
that would be true .
my children would give up
and even if it is n't going to provide you with any services in that it 's not doing to provide a route from your home to a business , for instance ,
this is a thing
it is
you start your public transportation when you started your cities
early on when then to take the business and residential patterns
and some , people do n't even own a car and know how to drive a car .
an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street .
and is just as guilty as anyone else
i drive to
to not having public transportation
felt that was a little wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying
a little bit much
can say at this time
think so
think that probably will do it ,
real talking
good enough
so what movies have you lately seen ?
have seen dish soap lately
that was a lot of fun and .
, want to see
that 's on my list to see .
was
it was not a wonderful film
have not seen
you did ?
liked it so much
that is also on my list .
, but a good movie
disturbing movie
you do
's see
it is different ,
'em up kind of film
but it 's with women in it instead of men
that is so kind of a twist on the normal thing .
so , was that kind of interesting .
enjoyed , but it really
that 's kind of what it was .
they started out with that
then they got into lots of trouble .
that 's what we did before we found the shopping malls .
'll have to keep on my list then that
it is
can imagine
and so it was interesting .
the social value of
they talked ,
it was a film of her concert tour she had taken all around the world .
she and kept saying her show was not garbage , .
it had a social message to it
you had just find it .
you have to wade through it and find .
we never believed that , quite
that was pushing it a little bit
she 's .
she 's rich .
she 's rich and
she 's smart at what she does .
she knows how to do that .
she knows
we 're getting back to last year .
can tell you
read my heart at wounded knee
liked it really a lot
it was a real raiser consciousness , i guess .
everything , and then went away for a couple years
and it is now back again .
and it 's sort of a popular view of what happened way back then .
of course , no one ever will know .
, known
who know
one was a warring tribe ,
you 've always conflict in the world
nobody can get along peacefully .
but wonder
and that was
.
you did n't hear any press about that , .
thought it was a very interesting movie
think so .
respect a little bit more than went on here ,
but knows how it is
just of the freedom of this country and who that really meant the
think so it meant something
but he is the director .
but
just thought it was a really interesting , intense film
that 's good .
think because three hours went by really fast for it 's the word
it was good .
looked at my watch only a few times , which is a good thing
it , but put me in a really bad mood
do n't
really did it ?
there were three of us who went .
so we decided that may be the mark of a good film .
it made .
it made .
no answers but .
known
and nothing to do with it , we have .
that can
we were not responsible ,
but we still felt the thick blame for , what had gone on .
that 's true .
the western story for many years
the whole story
have you seen any other movies ?
you sound like you
.
is just out of school
do n't have a job
should n't go all the time see movies so
go there .
it was
he or work in a movie theater
and then it just tells about their friendship that last through all these years
kind of
of the screen the
and loved it really
'll have to write down that
that was a great one .
'll have to write that ,
had n't
read the picture last show
that are now out , but
have n't seen and it
you did like it ?
very peculiar things
is
do n't have one in my home here
my parents have one
and they live just about three miles away ,
so we use that one .
.
and they are almost
what kinds of things and ?
word processing usually something such as for things forms
have been home schooling for the last three years
is the one that my parents have an apple e two .
of the apple programs for school programs
and so we use those
so , that is part of it .
the one at his house for business mostly things folks
for jobs and things
for his photography business and that kind of thing forms
tell
to having them
my father , had a software company
put together for us here something that
but they 're kind of older
so are not sure we 'll be able to get too many other programs for it
is a writer by profession
they are
have one of those
then
at the moment mine 's broke ,
ours really need to have some work done on it
he does n't work there anymore ,
could go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter ever
learned on there , too , and
have n't
used once or twice
it is the one that 's on my father-in-law 's computer .
that is probably .
that is so the program that they are using there .
have on my computer here that
and that there is what they have
be able to step into the position just
do n't know from my own experience , and
by now
is that
sort of thing
, you were
any kind of research or anything like that and too that keeps track of all your footnotes .
is that
how
that was a better one
and it was just awful .
so do n't
a nice kind of way is it
.
clock ,
think we probably have been talking at least ten minutes
not too much
what kind of things
was a technical writer for many years ,
actually met in a computer company and
he was an engineering and .
me
but you do n't need to drag down the hall it .
got a problem
that was
the majority of
and had a partnership in an advertising agency with another woman is an artist for
actually is working anymore , not
is a graduate student
so are doing a lot of writing
, have done a lot of different kinds
know right now , but that just
that 's been really great so .
is so
some days to have
they talked just and the other day about setting up again something
'll hopefully so soon
have decided to teach her how to type using the computer ,
that 's great .
skills that she is going to need early on certainly
and it seems like it is getting earlier and earlier with the children .
that 's right .
think so that would be a real , advantage to her to have that and do it early ,
we 've been , writing a story together .
put it into the computer
so if she is going to do that , it would be a whole lot if she could type easier and decided
we 'll slowly just learn to type here
that 's great .
that 's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life ,
might well start now
.
going really
and my husband is a ham radio operator
you do have children ?
have a daughter
do you .
how old 's she ?
she is only about a little less than two years old .
you reached the stage where you need promote a college or anything
have got one 's seven and one that 's three ,
so we started saving ,
but that 's all .
you planning to encourage your children to go to a particular school
no particular school
going
wanting to do
a big influence
what you can afford but what is going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals and not only .
whatever it is
where you did go to school ?
it was
but it was not necessarily
it was between there and a private college was a bit more expensive choice .
at the time , we could not afford it really
ended up so although it was quite a drive away for me going there
enjoyed it
you did
it was a six hour drive .
did not know that meant that you have to drive an hour when you said
it was like another world .
, did not get home often that
it is at that age and kind of sometimes difficult .
, especially if you have not been a lot away .
you did go straight there out of high school ?
did not get until later on my degree ,
of years a
it make your choices and when guess easier a lot
that 's true .
went on to get my master 's it
was pretty much
was and
of being able to have some latitude
the computer science
where 's that at ?
building .
.
about three years .
work somewhere else ,
that sounds like you got your master 's before here
actually came from school
.
this was the first real job after getting my degree
after my master 's
.
my undergraduate degree was not in what was my master 's .
.
a career change
.
's
there 's a lot of for different schools pluses and minuses just like you said .
who in what you can afford
encourage them to go different places up really so whether
the school
at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to
got my master 's at , which was a different school
and liked it almost as well
's , but not
if , that 's fine ,
would get quite a break on tuition
because you went there .
did n't know that
certain schools
do this school .
because it was kind of fun and .
and there was a bunch of kids and a bunch of schools .
there was a hundred schools , probably competing for the same kids all there .
talk up your , school
your own school ,
and was interested in it .
may have until you start thinking about it
and was so
that so well worked out .
you did then drum up any interest
or that 's good .
think so .
but it seemed like there was quite a few kids that was interested in going there definitely .
mother came by right , even before we started one , which was very interested in getting in having got or her daughter obviously
some more information and .
and she was , letting us knows how good was her daughter .
and she had these cards business she was passing out
and it was quite a production .
a little bit
it sounds like it .
what was one of the latest ones that you 've seen , actually ?
we pretty woman a couple months ago
actually watched videos at home
available to come and more often go
`` it 's worth it ,
and can see
went about two or three weeks ago
and that is , if you , like a really good movie
, not have done that one
do n't
do n't follow performers ,
do n't follow actors
, known
some
was best , but the one who was in the one about the old people
do n't know what his name is
though talking about know
also saw once around not long ago at any rate
, and that one was just a very poignant story
it had people ,
a lot of people said it was a really funny movie ,
but it was a poignant humor
and it was like steel magnolias .
the characters played very well off another one .
and there was
but the story was a very dramatic story ,
and enjoyed it very much
some others that you 've seen lately
, is trying to think
and can watch over over and over again
was going to read while it was , on
could n't just read
that was a really good movie .
it was sure .
a number of good movies like that
out now that there are quite a few movies .
and i guess , more than anything , that 's
you do n't work
staying at home .
and have one day sick
go during the day
that 's right .
that 's right .
there is nothing wrong with that .
go in the early hours
is not
and that 's
and quite frequently .
you going to be planning on doing that
ten minutes of
was
as the movie settles down to a comfortable action but ca n't
but the action was comfortable
good those guy , bad guy and of course .
the first few minutes of
and there were some others ,
was but
and could handle that , not
be have not dinner
he is
and then there is that
can wait
they will be videos and .
a lot about that one
if , that is the one to see
that is a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television
about that too read
think it 's time we have a lady the guys movie abuse
it 's about time for one of those .
want to go see that
wonderful is
is
but it 's just
and do n't want to go back
the one other
that the one other
he 's in there
thought that were really good and
saw that
and not can remember too much about it
not defense
and there was a murder of one of the women who was in the d - 's a office .
and then he ended up .
that 's right ,
now
.
when you found who was it out
realize that he would like his career to develop ,
do n't want to see in other things , but him
tell , but
do n't know
was never into those movies , either
, did n't care for the type of movie
and did n't like him
into a character marvelous actor
he does
, do n't know
and ,
did n't care for the last one either too much
it was just not enough .
what was the last one ?
is
back then was the last one
it was called hard way , when he was an actor , trying to portray a policeman .
go there .
question ,
do you own your house ?
try .
it 's a big in the sky mortgage
someday maybe , , and we might even own it ,
the mortgage but for all practical purposes .
our name is
so that implies ownership .
pay for it
that 's right .
would object if anybody did not
they really could move right into the spare room .
we had this one for five years now
the area , chose to stay inside of park spring like .
do n't know if you have been up here ,
but it 's a residential homeowners , association .
so , there 's a lot of activities , a lot of pluses and common land .
of the market the
it could have gone any lower not possibly
and so we were wrong .
five years ago
about a year later
would say , just recently
two years , when back ,
enough , two years ,
in your area , but
it was just different areas ,
, this area in
that 's a really nice area .
, and on hold .
do n't want to hear you
being
is on the phone , the answer is no
you do understand ?
how does that sound ?
go there .
that one down
going .
it sounded good to me .
say how long that will last too
this area up here is all homes custom ,
this house do n't think that many by the builder that built
and , we was the first owners , not
the third owners
watched the water just so
did not really mean it
he build hundred thousand eight dollar now houses .
but never , the houses here in this class of housing dropped below two hundred .
is the guy around the corner and
let
thought .
is definitely there somewhere
try and if it was a hundred dollars a square foot .
it could not be ,
because this house has four hundred square feet , around thirty
just never .
pretty closed for new brand
or that 's pretty much
it 's got an awful lot of nice things in it
nice things and really quality construction and the additional all other amenities desirable really
for square footage
look like brick houses
like the one that looks .
think
is
huge when
very
,
was in one today
because there is just the two of us
that 's true .
these houses up
somebody , was telling me
somebody , live back there
of construction the
they do not fall over
it , thirty days and takes something like to complete a house them .
that 's amazing .
are right now in back in fact , even as
these guys and .
they doing such a terrific job back there
you pay for it , too
but it 's really worth it .
, fine job
is
are the house
so , it 's
but that is one of the few things that really immediately pay back on return .
they come down here
less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars , which is probably about what their equity
must be a dream
his air conditioning bill , per month , last summer was
and
keep with the utilities here
he has , probably no insulation .
it is because there is no in those things insulation .
what a trap
or looked at a lot of houses around here
the right questions , can research and
think that makes a big difference and
like this area
, too , .
think if we have to sell now , we could come close to breaking even
and for the school and things like that
is the topic
and do n't have , yet
what about yourself ?
it is .
they living independently , right now
.
.
had any homes for them or talked to them about that ?
for them , not
room and den and kitchen
felt they and
that sound .
care could not be given in the home
most care can be given in the home even at .
just an excellent solution
you must feel about that real good .
also is that
a lot
great , grandparents in
and it was not a happy situation for any of them .
a lot of activities going on all the time
and this is
it 's not a senior citizens home .
the care
but it 's a very expensive solution .
good solutions both inside
just a matter of
, of course , and then there 's always
that 's what 's scary , and
the bad images of
and they can afford the best not really .
that 's right , and
took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation
apparently he had been in the home , just a week or so too long , and not
not to see him that they have been made aware , but when the family came in
was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance
so told them
what a shame ,
so that they put him in the home
and then they could have done well that at home .
she was upset , and then
was not even his
on a pair , of slacks , he had
said the wife and
took just two pair over yesterday for him that was clean
these stories , all the time
this was
in at
and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour .
just by looking at him , and the way he acted , you could
but the family all were talking about putting him in another home .
they said he will not go back to that one .
is glad they have a solution
do that ,
known
would hate to be in
and there was no choice .
getting upon just her condition
the situation is so sad because it just take all the dignity away from people who have been independent all their lives .
this was a vital really neat woman
and you get
the first thing that happens and you have to share your whole living space , with someone that you 've never known in your life before .
, and do not know what the answer is
some wonderful places out there
a lot of it goes down to just money .
that 's right .
if you have family that you can live with .
visits
would be similar to the way you would select child care
you would do your research
and you would go visit .
visit ,
hopefully , and they would have so that you could go there anytime it .
suspicious .
before she died she was
there was a name for what she had not at that time ,
she was really not aware of what she was doing .
can remember she has several strokes and
was right next to a hospital and
just to bring back her
and it was just like keeping something .
books
of different books a
one 's , a story ,
it 's not a story ,
of years a
and have gotten around to reading it just now
had a couple years it
who wrote that ?
do not remember the men 's name ,
by this guy who have these memos he wanted to sell ,
for the size of the company
a house store of
he was a great collector of everything ,
he did not throw away anything
.
that is interesting .
it 's pretty interesting work
that 's an intriguing type of
it does not have a real story or any plot and ,
you just kind of have to read and understand what 's going on .
a movie of the week of it
have not seen it
but it 's real interesting ,
also
another old book
but it 's a real good book that a guy wrote that was a research librarian ,
that
you familiar with that at all
was and
they were .
and they could not find their way back
have not
is sure that there is something out there ,
would like
thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years
whatever
this is one aspect of it .
it 's so weird , of course
cause no one will really know ever ,
but it 's entertaining
you think about things
that 's for sure .
that 's pretty much for right now ,
what have been reading
i kind of like read different stuff
and , like to read now and then
is trying to get away from just reading novels all the time , but
will sit for two days
that was and presumed innocent .
really really liked the way
it 's just , incredible .
that read too .
got it right , after it came out
before it actually got big this book , and she sent me
this guy is from here .
liked it really
that 's when it really got big .
was
the book other was in the last year and
of the vanity
although it 's pretty good
that was really , really good ,
the movie was nothing compared to the book .
is that
saw the movie ,
known
and not
but like to read gardening books and things like that
computer work
and so have a lot of those
time looking , not necessarily through those
, but is interested in a lot of that
a lot of
been not one reason or another
what is a book on your list ,
have too a list
and never have gotten to it
really do not have a list ,
just have all the books out ,
have shelves book
and have them out all
will go in and look through , and usually when
now have one
the name of
have one
can remember the name of it , and not
it is supposed to be a mystery .
is my son
he is ?
he 's in elementary school .
and he 's not
is he
's , but
till fourth in math grade second
resource , and they recently released him from
really was
do n't know if you 're familiar with that ,
is that
it 's something new ,
read about that in the paper
it is
and it is
he did n't have a problem with reading .
is as a matter of fact
the problem was
disability was
so you learned .
that 's right .
and so it 's not an intelligence problem .
just a problem with
or is this something ,
he did n't learn the right way just and then ?
it is funny .
when he was in first grade , he had trouble with spelling ,
it 's amazing .
you 'll say to him , cat spelling ,
he would go to write it , and then
kept saying to the teacher
is something wrong here .
you 're right .
and the teacher kept saying , he has a may birthday .
second grade it was ,
these teachers as far as
requested and a conference
is that
, was
the second week of school
something is wrong ,
the head teacher , the team leader and was a special education major .
how great .
it was
had and
so she was
have already
and she said .
there is
once the first report card they have , ,
and she said
sure enough , and they tested him
and he qualified for the help ,
and it 's been great ,
and they have nothing for her because of the cutbacks in the economy .
and to me that is the same thing .
it is
is this gifted poor child
but that 's the gifted in the home child more
that 's true .
that 's true .
in public schools is that
the private schools or parochial schools
before they take them , they test kids
, do n't take and they
if they are a problem behavior , and they 're out .
that 's right .
and , this is kind of a type of thing rejection ,
a school ten nine
students come in
and they come in
is a bad boy ,
and prove it
that really so for them
, would rather they have not that attitude ,
recently were in a discussion
between private schools and public schools test scores
and that was
that 's right .
ca n't necessarily blame them on the other hand , but
a private school
they can , and .
that 's right ,
they can be selective ,
that 's right ,
they have the ability to be selective .
but you ca n't say then , not .
you 're right .
's if a certain age and
and , they do n't really go on ever .
it is only
so that creates a problem .
ca n't so many more hours and
is that the other thing .
the foreigners here come
that 's right .
was talking to somebody recently
all social life , all everything and off put .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
that good 's ?
the child , is very bright
feel on the other hand , but
better skills
think it 's real important to have friends
think it 's real important to play sports
think it 's real important to be part of a team
said their childhood is extremely different from mine
we did n't do all that .
you do n't see , and
it , are strictly to
see as they get older ,
the type of
was quite large at one time ,
had a reunion yearly
back early on they used .
all local
it was generally around there .
that is where the family grew .
from just to city then city
it was a big deal ,
but they tried to centralize in one spot it .
so , they have in every year it at a state park .
and that usually works out to be pretty good .
do you go back ?
not have gone back lately
did not get to go , but
it choice or just business is
not to go .
the distance
have a younger daughter now
it is kind of hard to get her there , and everything .
not seen my daughter
you do have brothers and sisters ?
have one brother ,
and , are still your mother living ?
you go so
you would not
either way there were family reunion time or not ,
her a , couple times a year
that is so big no thing .
relatives
my mother 's father 's family had quite a few brothers and sisters .
so , it was a large reunion of that group from that descendants .
they all knew and one another at time .
a lot of those people and now
or is the relatives of that group
the next generation ,
and it 's not so close as it used to be quite as .
people less of a desire to go really
why do you think that it is close less than it used to be ?
those was a lot all brothers and sisters
they were back in the twenties and thirties around when they were growing up all located together , in one small community .
time went on
the kids of
do not what is a shame and the closeness used to be there
but that 's just how it is .
is it
that just family 's lack of
our lives work
think is that some of it
we do not have the extensive family we used
it 's more of a smaller unit ,
or we may not remember or very well know
really it makes
it requires a lot of effort to do that sort of thing .
, used to enjoy going
kind of
as many people there
it 's going just for the sake of getting together ,
you do correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that is in that group ?
not really .
my mother 's sisters ,
closer to them , because i kind of grew up with them
but , as for the rest of that group
not really .
ever saw them were at the reunion , and generally when
you do not really feel that really close to them .
it goes through me twice a year and usually
the letter last you wrote
and then that is
with what 's going on
do not know anything about this person and when
going on , and about
that 's a good idea .
that way
a nice way of
we tried to start in my husband 's family that .
of years a
start this letter
and my husband 's sisters sent it to us
and that 's as far as it got .
sent it , on to the next one ,
there were since that time
and the sister-in-law died
and is
we glad we took that opportunity two years ago
are still going in fact
that 's good .
so probably you could give some great advice .
, do n't know about that
what 's your interest ,
.
my area of expertise , it 's information systems , which is a little bit technical less than computer science and
because is part of this study
so , good luck .
about giving advice , though
what type of advice
to a
seems like the kid and at that age , especially if
a lot more and .
, but do n't know
at the same time , you have to decide what is important about the school ,
in one field started
think that 's what you just having to do with the size of the school , the environment of the school more said
think that is much more important
send a kid to a school , though , which has a number of different types of programs
do change ,
, do n't know
they do n't have to give up years of credit transfer and things .
is that
parents hear this
because
talk to the parents
because , the kid does n't
two in business administration a
do that make sense ?
what you 're saying
tells them that you should always because that is always
do n't know
give me five minutes
you 're at the office now ?
at work ?
is just
that is like what we were saying , though ,
, a private school or a public school
what 's the trade off there ,
tell ,
here , the public schools pretty good and
a public school actually
, and would
.
do n't think as at the public school
, does n't take quite as serious the kid and thought because it costs less
it is the minimal cost .
think you can get a good at public or private education , but
but think you can get a bad at public or private education , also
you have to look at the school around .
most parents or kids do n't know what to look for
would agree with that
is in fact
a particular institution might be better
but it is the same thing ,
me , kind of thing
it does have a big ten football team
that 's the basic criteria usually .
it does n't differentiate on my diploma ,
went to
actually is at a smaller program ,
, is not at the big college campus park ,
that 's the big one with the football team .
name recognition on
so it 's got big name recognition in this area ,
a big school science , no football team , but a big science school
and technical people know .
think you 're right ,
really you have to think about that for the job .
were looking for jobs ,
was going to be a teacher ,
, was just a teacher high school
recognized so most people
where 's that .
went into higher education , even at other universities
that is important ,
a regional job or a national job
you need out of school that first , job or so , too .
was
in school
the growing up while you 're going to school part
and they 'll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town who specializes in the technical field .
depending on your technical areas
could see that
the first three days , and
this is my only third call .
tried to make calls different two days
and could n't get through
known
it takes a very long time just
does it ?
been
just ca n't wait long , and sometimes
known
because it keep going through the thing over and over again .
this is
but , as soon as
tell me
what books have you
see 's
ca n't even think
have n't
and you are such a reader ,
known
do n't read all that much for enjoyment
for school a lot
but just do n't have much time for reading enjoyment
and it was called smart women or something like that .
did n't really like it at all
interesting .
could tell almost when it was written by the theme
was a lot of books like that
that 's right .
so that makes , and that 's when it was written that real sense
was n't aware that she had written for adults anything really
for her young people , her books
and she 's famous for that more ,
she been writing for adults also
what it was like and so thought .
you would have lots of conversations between rather than any description people .
you know how that is ,
really recently if she is written if she 's got in print anything
she
seeing a book by her that new
think it was an adult book and
but that 's
and
see 's
were on vacation on break semester between spring and summer
went to my mother 's , and
was probably in high school
a
a
a
that 's what it was ,
and she was really good .
read something before then
it in high school or college
but do n't remember it
think it was some actress reading it
how interesting
got for her , and so that
she doing that
'll bet
was that the book
think it 's around here somewhere ,
would n't
is going to have to put it , sometimes in the car and listen to it just
read that
is trying to think , and then
that are too
otherwise is reading so much for school
just have started reading a book
it is for school ,
not a literary journal
the first issue does n't come out until next year ,
but
whether or not a full-scale review , should be done for the journal
how
new books brand
got and this one ,
most of the stuff is on literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that .
and it 's a biography , which is really interesting ,
that 's fascinating .
it is fascinating ,
it 's really .
but it 's so long ,
the time to read the whole thing
'll go back to it eventually
so it 's a new brand book .
it 's a new brand book .
something like that
families had just loads of musicians .
probably , with these all just to generation
that 's right .
that 's the way it was back then .
that is interesting .
it was just really interesting ,
, but also because the board of advisers for this right now journal does n't have
think this man might be a worthy person to be in that position on the board
want to take or not
that 's rough .
is that
so it 's real interesting .
a neat thing
think that 's sort of a thing to do in small colleges , probably
a lot of small colleges doing things , like that ,
because it attracts really a lot people 's interest .
that is one way ,
it 's really good for small schools public relations ,
think so .
means
.
the translations and all different from one another so
different all
that is interesting .
so it 's multiple translations of single works
, all for him that
that 's great .
it is
me tell you
would prefer , doing that really
that would be nice .
do n't
but this is
does your family normally have a reunion ?
you do
we 've really
have on
it is not really on a regular basis ,
every few summers .
all the family lives in .
with everyone together the special
it might be a good time for you to start a tradition .
, known
you could
that 's true .
about how your family ?
you 're .
that 's good .
all of the descendants of the civil war veterans and come together ,
and they come ,
where do you meet and then ?
all of his direct descendants
so we 're talking about second and third great children here .
took them up until this year ,
they are
so they take their family .
but let 's see ,
that would make them , grandfather , great grandfather , great great grandfather
it 's a community hall .
it is , a big opening building great that have a wonderful kitchen ,
just you and .
every family bring a dish of some kind ,
the old all wonderful recipes , when family ,
we try to stay away from those things that might have salmonella in them .
that 's good .
most of us and of .
take home baked bread always ,
that 's nice .
my for that family
other things
others in
the one person in the family
that 's good .
learned a lot about them
, have n't , been to a lot
it was an interesting theory .
it 's all family
usually so
you do n't have to come home ,
it was interesting ,
do n't know how valid it is ,
every year out on the table
quote , officers of the organization , as
each year and it is
we have a biographer that continues every year to save clippings on any family members ,
it and keep the family alive , even though it 's very fluid .
do
is that
and they are
and it is
onto your roots
a strong sense of
my husband , on the other hand , was not very close to his family .
his family was
got to talking , and
said how his nephew are doing
, do n't know
my brother in three years to
how your brother is doing ?
do n't know
my son keeps in touch with him ,
but n't
like to know what 's happening with these people ?
it 's too much trouble .
that is incredible .
, did n't have that group cooperation
it by myself , did
and nobody brought
we have a big great fry fishing ,
and , it was an enormous task to bring together with just one or two people all of those people helping .
we have to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and
told him , and
we did it that year ,
the following summer , and then we did not have all of the family there
we sent invitations .
you are coming .
the year before
his mother was alone ,
, came to support and so they
one by one , he began to lose , and then
we have a problem with that .
and it was difficult to hold them together .
and , of course , then he died two years ago ,
to go down
is that
that was our problem .
the first major reunion was probably six or seven years ago .
so it kind of wound down , and
at that core group
they 'll send out news bulletins .
the legislature to
all to be on vacation recently
recently ,
my most recent trip was last year ,
that 's a nice vacation spot ?
it was n't really .
it was see .
as big a tourist spot that
that would be nice .
that was and real nice .
and we looked at all the beautiful scenery there
that would be nice .
that would be enjoyable .
that is , a nice break .
either been on vacation in
that refreshing to get away from always
so it 's a lot of fun .
last summer , worked up there
long it was kind of the , whole summer like a vacation
that 's nice .
work at a camp there
and got to spend a lot of time in the mountains up so
have to go on a vacation somewhere
my middle daughter and her husband , have taken up just a new activity
have really and
that 's nice .
it 's really , really pretty .
was a little kid , then
we and
we stayed at some park
and they have a little man who came down the river every night , mountain
and he would give a little talking about mountain things .
think he was n't a real mountain man ,
and , that 's a good place to go family ,
is that
the river and then was really nice because it was n't too frightening ,
but it was n't either too easy .
a lot of skills too
that 's true .
a relaxing mode of learning
that 's good .
see 's
that 's exciting .
that was a great time , because , is that such a neat place and
and there is not a barrier language
but it was really fun .
enjoyed that really
's probably going back to work , for a year there
because she has really a great desire to do that ,
it 's nice really .
and it was different really being in a big city ,
do n't get much into a lot really urban areas
a little anonymous weird
and you can spend a whole day without talking
but it ended up being kind of nice because you 're not accountable to anyone .
kind of walking around , you could just
do your own thing
and riding on the subway and watching people
and had a great time doing that
it was really interesting .
is that
there 's a lot out there to see ,
, known
'll say
have n't been anywhere else outside the united states
so that is a nice place .
that would be nice .
had a friend from there
'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with the language and all that all but
somebody that know their way around .
you have been quite a few places there .
we have .
once you think about it .
it was
twelve days where we 'd stop a city a day , just
on the training at night
that 's great .
it was strange ,
it was kind of sad ,
that 's great .
found in one restaurant we were
we have to break out the phrase book and start looking up things , and finally .
what did you wind up with ?
that was easy to say .
we were able to have that pretty effortlessly .
they kind
and , they were very helpful
so , it was a pleasant time .
'd love to go back there
there 's just not time .
to afford to see then there is not enough time to go see
plan for retirement , so when
what retirement about to be all
that and late .
it was nice talking .
.
and have a good afternoon .
the
thank you .
is back on
all my children , that kind of thing
you like enough well when you 're not going to be there
which ones ?
l a law
like the best two
two they 're going to change .
one they are taking , off .
known
is going to be history
we like l .
we do n't watch thirty something ,
but is that kind of young for us .
and
so we do n't watch that type of show ,
a law but l .
that
sorry , because we liked the ones that was there on all
known
is
like the new ones
with all the funny things the
are gone for so
where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show .
known
that 's not bad
known
is n't ?
it at all hurt him
do mostly like a story type of thing that lasts an hour you ?
usually n't like stuff that continues
that is one of our favorites .
you do n't in order to follow
usually do n't like that so
they at which grab your attention
known
both tape of them
sometimes .
is not into real heavy stuff
a l law is about the heaviest thing i watch .
, is into it for relaxation
like things like golden girls or cheers so
that type of show is
just some of
but mostly they are just little vignettes .
who new we found a one
you have
it 's really funny .
it 's not a cartoon ,
probably and robots .
but there 's always
and on what night 's it ?
of times
and ca n't
anyway , it goes on ,
and she , said no
he was running in a wheelchair to hide her ,
you ca n't do that .
is this tradition .
who , over the cliff thrown
said he and
the teenagers as the one that question what 's going on
and then ,
it 's tradition ,
and was the son
so , he does n't throw her over , and in
he does n't .
that been tradition for hundreds of years
and then we saw
or something like that
they all and go out and howl .
the son and refused to do it .
he did ,
so he did n't go howl ?
he would n't go howl ,
funny how
it is .
watch the show
our oldest grandson is the one who got us to watching it .
but it moves real fast .
it 's real short ,
, like , and there 's always
it 's just a half hour ,
it or are hour ?
half hour .
that 's all there is to it .
there are many half hour not
it seems like that ,
some parts of that
that really there in
it , they talk about that
have anyway , but
sports
n't
,
and some track and field
'll and watch snippets of baseball games
and just do n't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing
usually are doing either dishes ,
or have always , letter
known
or may be working around in the room somehow ,
from your old age
do n't sit
known
who had time ?
do n't have
do n't get watch that much
in bed all
before that , but there is not much time .
at six or 'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that
if , they have to watch that .
we do n't watch it unless they are here .
like
'll watch , kind of stuff game show
but .
in one
did n't think we 'd do ever
you did send one ?
my oldest grandson
he would n't
funny how
'd tell him it is getting ready to fall out , and
walked down toward he and around
at least .
that the paper this morning
with
thought that were most interesting
thought people started dumping trash then
set at the curb the dump
that 's right .
, a good thing part
that 's going to happen
a really good effort ,
that 's right ,
was thinking about the other day ,
went to a meeting ,
and was one of the speakers at the meeting
she had this fantastic in recycling effort family , and
was she and
one person , are doing that
was , but it 's a shame ,
if we did it all , much
because her effort would have been really really for all of us a good example .
and we were just sort of talking at the time .
we here and
now we are doing it on a , city wide basis in communities .
doing it
we came that far
what did she do with ,
she was a group that was doing it ,
, or was she doing it
think she was ,
was
she could actually
and so it was n't
and think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would
for the other thing a trash
that do that
you have to really want to do it , though .
and the glass , and the paper
, of course , and then you try to buy right too
is that it and
sure
we have neighbors who complained when we got the new garbage cans .
is n't ?
up when you 're going to get only once
--
do n't know , rather than say
work with it
do n't know
what you 're saying ,
kind of people like that
and it is .
it is for everybody 's benefit .
maybe we do n't realize it in our lifetime , so
but you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren
you leaving them and ?
it 's on down the line .
and have a real concern about that
.
we have much trash
was raised in a big family ,
gene 's family , and were n't big
but they were n't rich ,
they used just things ,
throw away things , before they were used
, known
got a good example from my mother ,
because she was always very , very conscientious about recycling things ,
she is to this day , and
the paper out of a box cereal
it would go on that
or , if she needed , sandwich paper , or something she 'd use that .
she recycles everything .
and have done the same thing
my kids get
the same thing
think they give me a hard time ,
think they know it 's the right way , but
,
they get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things actually
and dad , used to do that
how much it costs to do that
that 's right .
are pretty soon not such a bad way to go
that 's true ,
do n't know
your part and .
on all your life
this is what concerns me .
that 's right .
be in a country
a king 's , to most people ransom
a hundred , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollar house
people did n't like him .
the lights , conserve this , do that
do little those things ,
and , nobody wanted to hear it .
that make a lot of difference ,
think and you 're right , though
or you have to grow up with it being important before the message sometimes take really hold in your life .
and do n't know ,
used to be , a few years
think and to myself that are crazy
to bring to someone 's attention that
, and are seeing more and more of that
industry is willing to do it .
too we 're looking at is
is coming
that 's right
wait until to put our garbage
that 's right ,
that would n't
of some ocean the
, known
is that
it is and sad .
.
which is your favorite ?
your family , then do n't ?
anymore
that is one of those things , and
you just have to go once a year .
i
basically out into that ,
only have been once there
'd love to go back and
beautiful country
country
beautiful people
really like
we have a great time .
hearing for years
never met them ,
'd like to do that so
but that is our typical vacation ,
and we probably take one of each every year .
about how
but we 're not going to be taking one for several reasons this year .
never have a cruise
we have gone on carnival cruise lines .
are we book just a month before it usually ready .
we get and
last two times , in fact , we have an outside room
it was and beautiful .
what does on a cruise do you ?
never have been on a cruise
.
you want to be
you can in the sun sit around the pool all day ,
the games that they have going on
they have a casino .
they have a parlor massage .
they have exercise ,
you can do anything .
that 's just aboard shipping and .
that 's quite fun and .
we 've been there twice .
but we went with different people .
we have gone with friends each time .
.
me pardon ?
but it was
we really like so .
we 've been to a few places in this country .
we still have a lot to see , though .
you from
like you always , the relatives and so try to make it back home to see
we have both family still there .
that is fun and .
it bring back a lot of memories .
things different there , though
do n't know
just different world than this area
like it 's not so .
you did ?
they are going very nice places , and so
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know .
they have been there eight years .
just the car and driving everywhere and .
that 's great .
it 's nice ,
but it 's not home .
this is home ,
have never and
it 's so funny .
as , we 've done three times them .
going again this year if
we 'd probably go .
my husband , would
he kind like a little bit of the casinos .
of that all but .
the best part from
and other
like
so we 're going to be able to go up there .
that will be nice .
's kind of looking forward to that
do n't go in the winter
that 's what everybody , says
so that will be hard to stay away from .
for special occasions like that
on the truth
that sounds
going on
there are all too age groups ,
that 's kind of fun and .
at a table with a lot of people for your meals
people thirty years older than you or younger
everybody 's really interesting , and
everybody is there to have a good time and
they have shorter ones
and then they have ten days ones .
think seven days are long enough for us , but
by that time we 're ready to get home and get back .
and that was pushing it a bit .
overseas , for a long time .
that makes sense ,
it really do .
that is interesting .
his father 's and a doctor
and they took time , off
it was their winter
and they were having a little break ,
so they took some time off that they could show around us .
and it is a beautiful country .
it is beautiful .
they have mountains .
we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore .
that 's really nice .
and it is gorgeous .
and it 's just a gorgeous country .
most people do n't realize it .
think they 'd if they could get tourists coming improve considerably the economy
that will happen .
really hope so .
that 's really great .
said basically and forth to parents
that 's pretty good .
that 's pretty good .
and , my husband , had a conference in a l
so we spent a week in a l
you like a l do ?
is very unusual
do you do exercise ?
,
it actually
simply a number of different things walking with my wife
my daughter and sometimes will come along on little her bicycle .
and then moving up , i run in the mornings
not every morning about two days a week , it probably
but it 's along the lines ,
how about yourself
set out for them to be exercise
occasionally walk with my parents
and they have a normal schedule ,
have been out
do n't
but that 's going to start soon again
really do n't to exercise ,
if it know it 's exercise ,
but do n't mind if it 's like a social activity or a recreational activity
have to disguise it , so
and telling them it 's something else so they 'll eat it
that 's right .
that 's kind of the same thing for me .
so it 's exercise
you look at it as a task more so .
if it 's exercise , it 's a task .
do n't want to do
.
'll clean the bathroom voluntarily ,
wo n't but
who to understand that you need older to exercise
who plus and there 's
walk after dinner , so
go out in the morning
or just 'll get nuts
is so even though lowering my chance of heart attack and that stuff type
and no cholesterol and all that
all that
more than
is getting better ,
but it is still at the task stage .
, is a pleasure it for you
something as simple as a walk with my wife 's very enjoyable .
of the day the
the stress from the day goes away during that time .
did
the run ,
, too , and that
year ,
high school on
you do n't feel any more your muscles
and you do n't think about the pain of it .
you take the time
and you think about other things .
that 's no fun and .
and it 's so hard to get past that for a lot of people .
never got past that stage
better look
, is not a huge person
is just a regular looking guy ,
that little bit of definition in your muscles
so that also pay .
that 's good .
aspect of that take away the work with my wife , which is nice ,
i love
enjoy being with her
that is one thing ,
but also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles .
that 's it ,
the occasional push
felt real competitive there ,
do n't
but
that is something that too with time comes
'll tell you ,
ups push excellent ,
you are struggling against your own weight body
or your feet closer together , by doing them real quick or real slow
who at least , you can get muscles chest and the back of your arms up
that 's a good idea ,
do have , but
we have a stationary bicycle and a step stair machine here at the house .
is that right .
and stair step for half an hour
that 's funny .
it 's pretty healthy ,
started on that
maybe .
is what is real funny and
something else go away
is going to run in the mornings
the answer 's sleep
sleep .
is going to walk at night
and you have to think what can go and what , replace this thing really as you get older .
it 's not just exercise , but anything .
it 's very hard .
about having a program not yet
so i hope
think we covered it
good sound .
too you
have a nice days .
too you
a salad lettuce and a dish potato
fresh fruit and usually and then that we make a dessert .
that sounds good .
at the moment , not
, used and my mother 's recipe
really like
ca n't remember
that sounds good .
it is good .
that sounds good .
let 's see , and
did what else serve with that .
bread , you do
corn ,
french bread with that one too
have a recipe that 's pretty good for that
had it at once a party
you did ?
it was good .
have
you do n't want to be in the kitchen always
easy .
and they said it is good .
so , that sounds good to me , always ,
is in the kitchen
known
just not always for company , for family
is so often in the kitchen
not my favorite place
a place consuming time but
see 's
like to serve
have you had ever ,
, do n't know
that 's what .
do n't know what is that
stuff spices and
see 's
to make you take
the beans on first
you put , then
see 's
what 's next ,
the cut up tomatoes next and then the lettuce
to get a towel or go change
is on the phone
we do n't make it very often , i guess ,
n't very often
do they ?
that 's good ,
that 's good ,
of something in the sandwich
what .
where do they get it ?
, do n't know
they do n't have at home ,
they buy it just at
they just said they had it never at home .
when we have it at home , sometimes , taking this , it turns ,
the pit in it
that does help ?
the pit in the bowling with the thing
keep it
'll have to remember that
it really and stayed
that 's good .
thought maybe was that the trick
probably , that too
we have been buying turkey , instead of beef lately ,
do you want it ?
we have too ,
the ground turkey , the meat are softer
everybody seems to like it .
you do
sometimes it seems to be cheaper too
so we often buy it
we buy it ,
so we bought that
think in my house
do n't
in fact , we have been getting lunch meat that are turkey , too .
it costs
, do n't know
be something more healthy about it
instead of the beef and pork poultry ,
cholesterol less
probably is that all we need do for tonight
any specific other things
always
do n't know what you call it
that 's good and quick and easy ,
that 's good always ,
the only recipe family we make , is probably cake cheese
and we take a recipe from my grandmother
it 's probably fairly typical ,
are
where it 's going to be ?
is that
into the family
been well
where one ought to be out
people if it is too far to go
we have factions , where it is one part ,
reunion one on
if it is elsewhere , and other people come
at both of them we never get
never get them at both places ,
think we need find a new place
listen ,
they had this one
over the years of course ,
that 's a neat idea .
everyone in food and
really it and .
think it 's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people generally
ours is n't that big probably
our family are dwindling , for one thing .
is in a branch that 's all but died
have just one aunt and my family
and we 're kind of off on the sidelines
so we keep going even though we 're not a big real part of it .
and now going
our children
our grandchildren now going
that 's great .
wound up that we are now the old folks
a game for the kids baseball
several people and
and up in the afternoon there is
so it 's a full day .
there are lots to do so .
quite well work out
you do n't see long except once a year that the relatives
that 's true .
is that
they are
going to mine
go down in temple and then
he had a large family , and
so it is fun when .
so , that 's just too far away .
that 's a problem with the distance .
and it 's just too much for all of them , all of that group to travel .
it 's an , all drive to get to this area just days .
but then we have the same attitude when it is , although we 're going out this year out , there
be it as a timing vacation as well as reunion in
each year , of course ,
it is how much work
and of stuff
that 's going to like as far as food and all that some place
that is correct .
that 's a heavy burden .
it is ,
tell
really do n't care for her to be president again
but it 's a lot of fun .
we enjoyed it
and it is good for kids know they have other family .
this year and they are
the show this weekend ,
this weekend is going to be a rock and roll show
what fun .
and for them for us , too , it 's going to be exciting
of laughs probably
there have been some really wild shows put on there .
they really get .
and had it going along
ours is still
the same people and usually .
generally that happens .
and , as a labor of love .
so , the idea officer is a good idea .
we have various things over the years to raise funds for it
passing the hat
they have auctions and various things to raise funds
some people and
some people and .
and it is
me
but that 's the story reunion family .
a lot
talking to you
been nice talking
think is the biggest problem ?
the biggest problem in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that you can throw money at it ,
, do n't know
the schools reflecting society in a bigger way
or the values they get from home
it 's a lot more ,
it is socially unacceptable ,
a lot more emphasis on athletics
thought that carries over to a lot school and
thinks the biggest problem is with the home environment being part of it
while teach the moral aspects of things to the kids
you 're not going to do that ,
you 're going to out into the world you learned at home ,
that part of that ,
think , and
and is part of it
drugs , is now a big problem
think that 's another problem root and
i wonder if that 's a problem root or not ,
think a lot about that ,
it 's just like on drugs now
but i wonder ,
kind of
, of course they 're doing better ,
but because they still have a better success rate .
it is the socioeconomic mix
that way and they are not all ,
to the inner city public schools
actually was this
was people
just because their kids have the ability and the drive that they did n't send him to a public school ,
learn in instance not
in a lot of cases like that , if , because it is .
think it shows the parents , have some desire for the kid to do well
that may be passed on down to the kid as well , and
maybe they and pick up on that .
do a good job because the classes , may be smaller
they may be able to give the resources that are needed to do a good job .
i
what would you do to fix the school systems and ?
that 's a tough question how to fix the school system .
at home and respect for other people
think that 's a big part of it
if you 're not going to care about learning ,
you 're not going to really care about yourself .
was going to say
it is the chicken , and the egg thing .
i wonder ,
that since high school
in school grade
when they 're doing that goes through
but that 's not an easy task ,
it 's a tough question
because 's kind of hard when you are growing up in a home that may be just the pits ,
any kind of a good environment to live in
care of other people 's stuff
could see where that would be a problem ,
as a matter of fact .
are assisting them with in their selections their children , so
my children grown
but they 're teenagers
went back then , as
is so in the environment child care
in today 's environment than on one care is the one more
had them in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids , when my children were growing up and until they were in the preschool situation , up
was that home environment
it was important to me
feel that they have one on one who are necessary so at that age and
it is .
in other words , there are more people ,
, in packages
of view an interesting
days a week 's all our school one provides for the three under year olds
but they still have an opportunity to be with other children
and it is true ,
without a doubt ,
and she was telling me
and of course , she had just got
she was so enthusiastic and ,
was and
she was going to accomplish and all of these things
and spend that kind of time , the pay
it is .
total and complete dedication really do n't want to make in order to be in that environment ,
that 's right ,
maybe that have in their family where they can do that , another salary
have the opportunity of doing
providing the creativity and , with a great atmosphere them , and having a lot of fun with the children really
they be there ahead of time
they are there
that 's right .
clean crews in most of those
that 's true ,
that 's true .
a terrible time keep simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary
ours is a church ,
we do n't have so and the expenses of a building
with the church the expense
but we do n't have enough
so it 's a lot different .
my older son
so he went into child care at two weeks
and my younger son went into child care at six weeks .
actually up until they became seven and nine so , they were in that environment
said , and at
and can provide for them
however , they are going out now into the environment school ,
they are under a lot of other influences .
need be here for them
in their school
so that involved in volunteer work in their private school
you did ?
well , is that
a lot of people do it
known
that 's right ,
, just felt very strongly about that
as a matter of fact
my son , was in the second grade
and mom , do n't do to me that , he said
do n't do to me that
knew it was time to go back to work so
very good about spending those years with my boys
that 's true .
have only one child care bad experience
it was in a home .
and she was going back home ,
and could n't just wait for three or four months and then bring them back to her
have so find
, and put them in this home
went there one day ,
well for care not
awful ,
so it did n't take me out of that place long to take them
only the bad experience
the rest of the time they stayed in la petite academy
with their development and their progress
soon they did n't
but they 're going to learn it sometime ,
for the most part , they did
, and had a good concern for them
however , my older son come home
kids do well exaggerate , she said , and
send him another day , or two days ,
exactly what 's happening and .
have a personal computer at home
do n't use it very much any more
used to use it quite a bit
about what you ?
do you own a computer ?
a computer
neither one
you leasing them
sort of
that 's the nicer way .
had just a baby ,
and my husband 's
brand
is
, do n't know
what kind of consulting do you do ?
what kind of work do you do when you 're consulting ?
,
in the different places
is it
program
research
work in the field speech , and
that type of stuff typically for other people
use for writing papers and things like that it
word
is not familiar with that
word it
use a processor word to do it
and we do n't have much too standard software .
any available software at all
so we do n't use for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that it .
writing when we need to or doing research , looking at the speech signal programs
to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
, one
we have .
but went out ,
got completely off sort and of
a computer
opened up the box
that was it .
the second thirty
did n't hear it
do you , the beeping in the background .
think that 's an ambulance or something
where
the second thirty
you at home now
is at home
noise traffic real
look at this signal because there 's a lot of noise people can hear background
much of it actually get
is what time it now ?
about twenty after four .
an hour ahead of
is in central zone time
we 're
did you try ever using prodigy or any of those systems and ?
have n't done that
known
and she is
she told me some of the things you can do ,
and it 's just a very handy tool to have .
it makes things very convenient .
long distance charges if that 's what you have in mind on
using that
do n't know too much about it
you did
word perfect
not heavy use
have
have been through three classes
and have a great deal of respect for it
have n't done much word processing work with my job
some
and was
have never
good both things and bad things about it
it 's got some pretty strong competitors .
some of them have
so , it is a matter of personal taste .
people told me .
can understand that very easily
also in paradox and had
of those both and seem
you do
pretty much these days
, would n't say compatible
certainly comparable but
, did n't mean compatible
comparable
mainly business data
production support for the systems in my area of responsibility
late at night at home because there 's a problem production , called
what do you think about it ?
the armed forces
they do it to prisoners
in some professions mandatory
, then they should not be employed there
would not mind it
harm or injury absolutely , if it 's an area where they could cause somebody else
and do n't have a problem at all with testing in the hiring process employers ,
, but do n't have too much , testing even after the fact
a little bit where it would n't hurt anybody but .
, do n't know
a little bit too far
unless an employer has a reason to believe that the work competency of the employee is hurting the business .
and then it 's not a problem .
in that type of thing
because of the cost to be
there 's no way .
but my concern 's school bus drivers .
the training drivers ,
is in education ,
is not
concern in the medical field
screen in these areas for alcohol
they would
they would ,
speak so by the masses than drugs
known
and it does n't take that long .
they do n't
just could mean life
just
our employee numbers
once since they initiated this testing random program and
i work with
randomly three times in six months
have a problem with it , when there 's no reason to suspect someone
control .
that is enough to make paranoid anybody .
that way you ca n't feel like somebody is to get me out .
for duty jury
so when they spun the wheel , your name come out of pot
that 's just the way it is .
it really could get out of hand .
if somebody does at a party observe you would think that it would be their obligation to report that
to report it
or something ,
feel
what kind of
there would be a situation where you were at a machine and working but even .
work on the line
is
they could n't
out on the line , but they 've got people working serious some equipment .
put at risk
totally
by drug abuse or alcohol abuse
in the long run , and we 're all paying for that
so it protects when us in the long run .
was
living , just a few months ago
wanted the government city
took them , the city workers saying it invaded the search and seizure amendment and to court to protest
and it is still up in the legal channels .
on whether they can test them or not
especially since a local employer , also are doing it already
just a small group of
it is the whole city ,
they just do n't
never have been in a situation where somebody said
my husband 's
however , this is n't a problem that we 've either alcohol or drug ,
in our minds so , and we are thinking that 's what the big deal
looked at it
if it is one thing ,
you know
so it 's not as big a deal ,
really concerned about their rights
then to do this , they 're going to take away from you if you give them the right
do n't believe that
think an employer has the right to ask you to do anything ,
you do keep a family budget
, do n't use a family budget
my father is very old
should probably
he keeps every pence -lrb- come in and goes out on a very strict percentage .
interesting .
we sort of started doing it years and years ago
and my husband started
i sort of just got in the habit
can not really say it 's a formal budget ,
is going to have just
think it makes sense much more ,
and recently have gotten out of debt , and everything
a little better , track of it
what come in and what went out .
real similar
at least a
was and
of course , and he 's from the depression ,
so it is his life ,
think , but it would be smart if somebody would keep some sort of a plan that work for them
think
it must have been interesting to us sort of
change over the years
it is .
for instance ,
, is a historian
could not believe that he did ,
my mother was not long ago going through some things as a matter of fact .
and , it was
, of course , of course , it 's
known
for a pair of five dollars shoes was like
, known
for hotels
that , something is n't .
that 's really crazy , and
that is about thirty years ago
that is something really .
, of course , but it 's
that 's true .
if people will .
that 's right .
that 's just good economics working old .
we have tried to instill some sense of budgeting in our kids ,
unlike night and days as
and , our son , could care less about a budget
our daughter watch closely so that her pennies
, if , something goes wrong , it just throw her for a loop
one ,
the other one , may be very careful
and she may marry somebody
because , of course , it would be good , and then she will
you should have one in the house .
think that 's true ,
think that 's what happened in our house probably and
saving before and so on
was working out of college
and that really paid off .
because we were as far as not having any major debts when time come for him go back to graduate school
that 's about the way it is here ,
would probably have been in debtor 's prison , if we have one if it had not been for my wife
but , you husband do
he is an engineering ,
we have a lot of years of budgeting , so .
you do when it
my wife , are still getting her doctorate in school
is working on my master 's degree now ,
this last year we had three ,
both of the children , was in college
our son has a year left
this year and our daughter graduated
is just about ready to finish my master 's degree , and
we have a real lean year for us once again
known
-- in college plus my wife , we have three
that was so four .
like then you know .
which you learn
that is the best one .
with education you ca n't
that 's right ,
it 's one that you can live through .
so it really make it easier
that 's true .
could hear more about your historian part of your life , because that sounds fascinating really
is interested in that
would send you , if
also is in the travel business ,
tours
just went there last year ,
, actually did not take we
that sounds interesting .
could you just so
what 's your last name ?
.
good ,
of sections a
is that
.
wonderful
will look up in the fall you then
fantastic .
it 's been a good conversation type .
and being able to be outside , enjoy outside activities
playing tennis
a court tennis there
the beach is great .
a pool is great .
where do you go usually ?
see 's
that 's a nice place to visit .
and we did not have a chance to do that .
sure would like to go back there and again do that , but
we have a vacation in several years
first our chance in
have , but
it is gorgeous .
go before quite a bit
condominiums there on
they very , very large condos
and , they have quite a few rooms ,
so we usually will rent one for about a week or so .
the , beach , and is nice
go down .
, the beach is n't it
it is beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and a , lot of nice waves , usually
sea shells
is
sea shells
there is not as many sea shells along there ,
they have some , but , not so much .
usually if you will find right , but not in there some .
do not know why it 's ,
it seems to have not as many right there .
we but
usually every year at the same place
right on the beach and like
where do you stay ?
we have not just gone yet that direction .
of a jetty there , which is sort of the very
and it is
it is the last set of condominiums there ,
and it 's very nice .
it 's not very expensive ,
and their kids
, about three hundred dollars for the week
that is nice .
it 's really ,
it got its own full size , kitchen , and everything
and , this one , has two baths
is the one we got
it is really a nice stay .
in fact , we stayed on our honeymoon , there
the particular suite we have gotten was very nice
and , so we decided to stay .
but it 's a pretty nice place ,
will need to try to go
it 's a little far from here ,
are
.
,
it will take a day , and a half to get there , probably .
they switching to an alternate calendar this year
that do
is what it is supposed to mean truly weeks of school , three weeks of vacation , nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation nine
a month break two and in the summer like .
of the children the
.
within a year , anyway , so maybe we will see how that fall .
that is probably all we need do today .
thanks a lot
you do
from the change in roles in women
or what do you think ?
think so .
there 's been a lot of changes .
there is still
think so .
someone work outside your home ,
during your time there
as a men 's job
what kind of work do you do ?
is in a men 's job
but we 've got more women in it now .
there 's a lot of us in it .
is going to do that , but not
maybe .
were either the only girl or one of just a very , few women in the class
so , that was a change
did not use my math in my work , and
became a technical writer
very , very few women in
a lot changed
just a lot really in recent years it has changed .
more and more women get
think , but they 've got a long way to go
thought and that 's a pretty significantly small number
are so
, but not do know
how it is now for girls about when
, that women were not able to succeed
do you have children ?
was going to say
that 's always a good question .
do you ?
have in fact
.
although there were some other women in her class , she was , one of the minorities
females in the class
she so definitely entering into a male profession
but , for instance there are the organization of women engineers the society --
, as a place where women should be
, but not do know
is not either ,
but really doubt will change
not for a long time anyway .
probably .
trying just
known
you think about this .
the role of women in combat roles during the war ?
can serve in combat roles
in the armed services that seems willing to do that only the branch 's and the air force .
women capable of doing the job
it was real interesting ,
was listening to some of the comments on the other day television about it ,
, what was
very high
he said it is just a personal thing with me .
can not
would have just a man doing some of these jobs than a woman , but rather
, at least he
but that does not very well with a lot of folks sit , is
more than most women
and think emotionally women can handle a job , every bit as well
, too , .
do not see that they should stop her if she wanted to go to combat and
personally would not want to go
would not either
that
is that kind of job but
that should be taken into consideration , as well
this is an interesting topic ,
she did anything differently
so , is that progress , i guess .
with a lot of people in this project
same here
is not at home a lot
right now are at work
my number working
but at home , the recorder got my calls .
is not there , usually
talked to seven or eight people , but probably
that 's great ,
that 's good .
any yet calls , myself
it never crosses my mind .
enjoy receiving them , but
that 's good ,
that 's good ,
placed all but one or two of my calls
our choir are doing this as a money raising project .
we doing it to raise money for a large project at church
like this is one
painful financially , anyway
is that
it that way is
will get on the stick and do it just
that 's great .
enjoyed the conversation
thanks for called
thank you .
we living in that world
we not
our families
families
society
change
it makes you and
raised guys
let the world training
been in the home
really and would
think
they expected to do so much more than they used to
would go off just to work and come home ,
everything and was done .
and it 's a different world .
,
it 's nice there is a choice .
have chosen to stay at home and raise my children
a year twelve
a single for
that was great , and
was able to provide for my children and
and that was
i volunteer and a whole lot .
that 's my job and right now .
it and .
really .
said the same thing until my boys
then went back to work
and that will come .
that day , will come
and is looking forward to that too
but that 's a different phase in my life ,
and is
a lot of
like oil on
it changes
in a lot of ways never
women at one time did very heavy physical labor
you beating rugs
you doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing
we really or do develop some health problems .
is so in that respect for
you think it 's that way with men too
true absolutely
that 's true with society , in general ,
specifically the woman 's role , in society , but .
heart disease was characteristic of men ,
disorders and things
think that 's a symptom of our society , and
a general illness
or what was causing the problem ,
, saying that you need get them into lessons music , in raising my boys know that
you need get them , into sports
you need get into this
they need be busy
and they need be active .
fought and all of those things ,
in they will come
and they will say mom this is important to me ,
want to do ,
will otherwise guard their ability to have quiet time
it is funny ,
it is funny ,
it is funny
we going to have some time off
and that 's the way it is too with a woman .
and it 's been real busy .
we have so much going on the past few weeks
you and
is that
the family
ourselves doing things that never , we did as kids
in things like this
it is different ,
do not know ,
only time will tell whether it 's better or worse , than the way we grew up .
but it 's just very different .
of course .
is very much in quiet personal time a believer just
you do not have
my children 's rights for that
and think they should do not
they sacrificing their time with themselves
, you working on your own self
finding out
and , have to come home and prepare a meal and get homework done ,
and where you do find
it is not your homework in the first place ,
it 's your children 's homework .
and they asked me for help ,
helped them with exactly what they asked
and that 's all .
that is a part of the problem that
other people 's responsibilities and .
that 's very true .
not change , hundreds of years in
that 's right .
that way husbands
intellectual cripples
children and .
they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible , for themselves .
did n't
do not know , but
they look at the mother as the one that solves all problems
all things to all people
that 's very true .
and that 's
that 's very true .
she had a new policy in her home
is having a problem with another member of the family ,
, have taken a new stance
, say , and no
will not
you work for yourself out .
it 's amazing , she said , and
that 's right .
's and
is not doing it anymore
think that is one of the things that we have today that is very useful ,
be at least
about strikes or things
what was you saying ?
you do
at all .
i work with computers
with computers
but you have friends that have children .
have some friends that have children ,
that not actually .
do not really know ,
me
have , child care on premises
me excuse one
not at all ,
my situation in fact , is a little bit strange
was doing consulting work
is taking a little bit of time off right now just so
i hope you can stay as long as possible with it .
can hopefully do some consulting working at home
that would
spend the time with my daughter
might start to go too crazy with it , but
the intellectual stimulation
but it would break my heart to a stranger to give her right now at the same time .
it does when
they changing every day
the little things
put her in day care for joint , situation right now , unless it was one child other with a person
would not want to be in a large situation day so young care her
that 's right .
should get enough stimulation from the rest of the time you
that 's right .
they going to go there
that 's right .
i play with her most of the time she is awake and
think that is so important and
, with the mother
and they took infants starting at six weeks ,
there are times of days and even when
the room not real bright
and , they have different things they will put them down on the floor ,
of course , and they 've never more than five ,
and they will put them on the floor down
think and was one of them a little mirror
some and just different objects , had a definite for kids purpose was
and there is something about their eyes .
how old 's she ?
she is now two months , nine weeks .
to another and things like that one
she is just started that yesterday or the day before , and
every days different
child care for infants is
a little older
you might have a real problem with that so .
really leaving the child in a strange place
things work out
but that is unusual .
leave a fair amount , even at this young age , , just to go to a movie and things like that , with
it 's your parents or your husband 's parents ?
my parents
so , it 's a little bit harder
she is
she will not remember them ,
but she 's met them .
, have three grandchildren
could not get my hands on them , is
, like
are
set up your work program and your husband 's so is one of you there all the time
for the child
you do decide to go with child care
at times that .
the situation right now is so tight at many places , that it 's hard to have a choice even .
people before they get pregnant finding child care for the kids
and just .
my sister-in-law and are going to have very , very soon a baby
because , my daughter and so will be about six months older than hers .
that would
she is
and so she might be able to do it
i watch , their baby and even might even be able to do it on a trade off basis .
exchange that way
will and so we just
, too , .
of people a
or
trained well people
to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner
that 's real important to little kids .
my daughter does seem to be yet on a real schedule , not
do not have a real schedule now
she 's been staying late at night up
and sleeping late in the mornings and things are just fine by me .
that 's a problem , and
society 's geared to a person day
, have done this
they stay up until all hours of the night .
, is the product of as much of women as anyone the changing roles
was really , first generation in our family divorce
the first one of
of the family my father 's
we just kind of basically dropped off .
it was always my mother 's fault ,
she was
she was just not good enough .
what was wrong with her , was not attractive enough she ,
did she take not good enough care of her man to keep his interest .
it was that kind of an attitude .
that is too bad .
it was too bad ,
it was really rough .
that 's sad .
it 's really .
is so that
have been a product of
to college in my family
my mother have always always a career in a secretarial position
is that
she was a secretary to a federal judge .
and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him .
so , that was
is that
thirty thousand , a year over
that speaks , well of your mother .
she has high standards .
with a steel rod driving hard lady up her back .
degrees master 's two
is the director of music in a church and
challenges .
to have to do with my sex
taken seriously as at professions , not as
, is a woman
than they would ever a man
also as a director of music
so are pretty aware of what goes on in the church
is talking done
do you want to talk ?
, and can relate to that
that it is the image
always .
things changing
taking longer a long time
at a snail 's pace
but .
so , is that
are in the long term
and have seen , the error of their ways and
a lot of die-hards out there who will never change but .
so we have to face also that reality .
why they can not accept just competent women ,
never have been able to understand that
it 's fear
along with that , they .
and they know
that any problems ego
be , in the long term
just because and looked .
though men have a lot of trouble with that .
they do not in
and so it 's
they really much more comfortable with somebody being the follower being the boss and somebody
they more comfortable that way
but it 's really just interesting to me .
thought .
, but when he get angry , it is always over control issues
it is always over power issues ,
and you did not do it
only the issues
think it 's difficult for men just to accept equally women ,
they more comfortable when somebody is the boss
dictatorships real efficient
when the women and
strongly and
be , with what is the subject matter
think the issue should be settled before there is a conflict and
and think that can happen in a very wonderful way
you can
always if your husband to you did that and you did to your husband that would
it is true .
so that would be a beautiful relationship .
it would be .
some people have done that ,
have seen and it
and it is
see 's
we have n't seen one .
do n't
it was n't that good .
it was entertaining ,
but
do n't think the general audience would go for it
that how
that was excellent .
it was just a really funny movie .
is that
a story line about people find it
there were parts that was sad .
it just ran the gamut of emotion .
but it was just all around .
how long did movie that run ?
it is still to the best of my knowledge , on .
time how long , but
it was two hour
think it is less than two hours
seemed
that always seems
this one , but it was fairly long .
it good was .
so we really enjoyed that .
is looking forward to seeing that one
that was next on our list ,
can highly recommend that movie to see
good deal
good deal .
you do very often rent movies
a week a
they get up at the store ,
that is exactly right .
'll with luck and
most of them
we do n't get out as much
we have two children ,
so we occasionally get out to the movies
a fun thing to do
quite frequently , we have our on the weekends grandchildren
we 'll and try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see
what ages
finding movies for them
the oldest , is nine
's three
he does n't really pay attention .
does n't have the attention span , either
they have been doing that .
for good for the kids to see a movie out this summer
the last one they saw was home alone
that they and
missed , but that one
my husband took the kids to see
my wife took
but we can find something at the store for them to watch generally .
that 's a good deal .
we saw this movie ,
last weekend
have
and , how do the story line go ?
he is
and a woman prosecutor in there are murdered
we have n't seen one that .
's and
but , course , it is one of these with a twist where it looks like he is the one that wound up killing her
and it is an extremely long movie .
it is long over two hours .
which ,
she like the suspense movies .
to a degree
wanted to pick up the other day ,
my husband was n't going to be able to watch it with me , and then
save better for another day that one
save for another day that .
think he 'd like that one
, then
it is
that 's a good one to put on the list .
it 's like most movies suspense ,
fatal attraction
once you 've seen once , you ca n't really see it again
and that did when it happened , and what
do n't think so at least
too many of them
it 's a shame ,
, do n't know
known
, and laugh
my wife , ca n't understand
about that one
either but we have n't seen
so it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies .
we like to laugh .
have a theory
movies for entertainment
from watching a movie
,
.
life is
that 's for sure .
talking with you
thanks for
have a nice weekend
a good movie soon
would not want to live in
because it is the situation
it 's very location dependent
right outside the city
much working people class , though
to the university
it 's really funny ,
just the kids being
's most of that
that make sense ?
something like .
fathers missing
no consistency there in
there is no one to tell them is right , and what is wrong .
are more of the upper middle class
we do n't have a certain amount of local problems , not
we get on the other hand , but
the main crimes within the suburb and here .
, they having murders at a rate greater than one a day , unfortunately , and
a lot more and .
think they have definitely more problems in the area
think can prevent crime ?
but that 's which first came .
the problem is basically in the society and the society 's views
,
even have to worry about
a lot in
think the drug culture is one of the main problems definitely
that make sense ?
he is one of the big proponents of that .
and he was a district attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming mayor .
it 's a different viewpoint .
have real on that mixed feelings in a sense
it certainly would be an interesting test
what happens if .
, did n't try to save themselves from it then
have
care of people but now .
have
that 's true .
then when you make them available people do n't use them
, but never heard results or anything like that
but that was interesting ,
, do n't know
the drug culture ,
see anything wrong with it
, a baby of the old school and of course is
but we 've basically so much of the for nothing mentality something more .
that 's true .
that 's true .
we worked hard for everything .
that 's very true .
people have the idea they can get something for nothing
i work for a lot lawyers
is a good one , and
and
you have your designated driver better
in this country for example with alcohol or with drugs we do n't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say
it and .
actually , just caught on
was in high school
an awful three years of recovery and the difficulties , and everything we did
of the town the police
but he was
so our insurance , paid for everything
but it was a very difficult time
was and then later
and they questioned us
it was an acceptable social behavior .
very much .
some important points
what does your city have for control gun if anything
i work quite a bit with
i look , and from more
they can find guilt or innocence
, too
should the jury
think the judges , should
not knowing exactly from murder on up to tax stuff .
have been on a few juries
, have been an expert witness some
so that it is so hard to come up
is one thing that you get if you have some expertise and
two or three times
and juries might sit on three most over .
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime if they 're lucky that sometimes .
they may have some different idea , and
it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was longer that the punishment did n't fit the crime .
or or not long enough whatever the case may be
the judges do have better knowledge of it
there has a name , which is the defendant and sometimes might have more pull , which does that happen ,
we ca n't say it does n't , because it does happen .
not everybody sometimes has the right morals .
whatever the case may be politically can
that 's not real fair , either , though , and sometimes
things that get me on the juries often are in that
often in the headlines
or get reduced in terms of sentences
that makes the press and never
gets as you or on a jury
we do n't have , a lot of knowledge , again , and
really the range of
also are either fair
but , that does n't make either any sense to me .
and other all this stuff
like , they were
should pay for what you did , but then , when to me ,
and you should n't be able to go on the lesser charge .
do n't think that 's right because all 's what 's going to do is to say
can go out and do it again
that 's not right .
that is where the role of juries is restricted
'd want to change ,
is that it is restricted in the sense
is , it if
with first degree
and you can decide guilt or innocence on that .
it is what information
we call , in a sense
they decide guilt or innocence
somebody think it had , because they 've got there it .
have all the information
do n't they ?
the oath , is to tell the truth
they do n't want the whole truth .
part of it
different parts of the truth
that 's just like that old witness game ,
it 's a game too play kids
somebody did it , but just for
there was four people ,
's your occupation and
is a substitute teacher
substitute teacher
it is ,
it is .
is a substitute teacher , in
trying just
is going to be at a different school this year
then , for that
not really .
so is going to be down on the floor with them
known unless you have been there at
you can add or take off
.
some of the dress codes different at different schools
about whether she would allow slacks
and she said she , do n't have
she did n't just
and said
try to wear a skirt
have sometimes and even for me
or they have week that you wear your different outfits spirit
for that particular school the
with some sort of hat
and you never know , though , sometimes when you 're going in
might be a week spirit going on
on what ,
so , would that kind of give you a clue
the long term stuff
so you are aware ahead of time of what is going on .
and do n't know ,
they have for the kids
one on the parents or the teachers
no blue jeans
wear with it
and do n't
if you 're going to tell the kids
the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers
think it vary , just so much , but
anything can go .
but they 're just sort of into clothes ,
and then there 's
and they 'll wear just your common , ordinary whatever you might say
a couple teachers up there do dress up more than others
you 're going there ,
the men in a tie and a coat suit come
going on that would
are you
go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants .
did n't understand ever
and then have sixth athletics period
would say
go and then to their coaching
their shorts on there and .
then change
is that
is that
but , they do n't wear their sweat pants or anything .
can understand
and that is hard .
but ,
will have to follow the teachers
do n't think we 'll ever get to that
you do n't think so .
do n't think
think we 're going the opposite direction
do n't really
some of
and it is not at some of the private schools ,
it certainly make it easier to dress .
it 's certainly cheaper and in the long run that you do n't have to be concerned about your wardrobe easier .
think that it would make a difference at school
worn shorts , too short
a lot of
, of course , say , why then the kids and
just let
and we ca n't yet to that either .
wear a button down shirt
but i doubt that will come about .
the girls , and then
just ,
not ,
think it does
it takes off of trying to compete their minds .
push to dress a lot more professionally teachers
a lot of teachers
did you go to college ?
did
and where you did go ?
a small school growing up to
and about what you ?
,
where do you live now ?
are
had he
visited once or twice
really like
.
.
really .
your daughter and are going to be a sophomore .
that is correct .
have two daughters ,
but my oldest will be a sophomore .
who , which is , my youngest daughter this summer
so she went for a week ,
and it was
thought this would expose of them to what it 's like both on a smaller campus college and
at all with the idea of a small school
still think so the exposure was good
what was your selection criteria .
base in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford it on
there are all of these areas to look at or in making the decision .
and those were several that we did consider .
did n't
was used to a lot of one-on-one or group small situations
.
in biology major
how exciting
and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing
and ended up
because they have a strong science department was
they also have a strong language department
working with children
could n't fit in everything ,
that very well worked out for you .
but he thinks he wants to be a writer
and do n't
so he is used to a bigger size and
large classes
and because my brother is that he would have family , to close by there .
are so
and they really felt like they were numbers .
went from a large high school to a large university
were a number
it is
but that was my only option .
could n't really just look at anything else
the one and only thing than
is so that
especially today with the cost of college
that is a major consideration
when you mentioned that , and we have it .
and it is for a private school
it 's a smaller size and
a lot of options
he hopes to be a writer .
he thinks that 's what he 'd like to do ,
in math and science too really
we keep and encouraging him to keep an open mind .
your daughter do know what she 'd like to do ?
in all directions going
and do n't know ,
a lot of
and she may end up doing something with that .
, is a single mom and
the mistake of
have not made my children
kind of
that piece of paper
do you 've just one son ?
.
it sound like he 's got of what he wants to do some really good strong ideas .
, and of course , there are still time ,
if he can make but , he is beginning to feel that , as much as he enjoys writing .
the weather been hot
and it is
it is not really late into the summer ,
to this area
the summers got hot
and we did n't really have until may heavy rains this year .
pushed the season back of
and it just tried to rain ,
was coming from my car in just a few minutes
that 's right ,
that 's right .
it 's really
where it 's been so dry
and it just got so dry
and , the earth open up .
the first year
and it did n't rain ,
moved here in
and you sort of rain forget how much it did
here coming and
it did n't rain , and then
it was
you and so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities , if it were going to be a go because of the weather or not just never
on little your parade
that 's right ,
that 's right .
it was here , and pretty much you could schedule outside some activity
and you did n't really have too much of a chance of it getting rained out .
you could pretty much
that 's right .
what brought down here you ?
a job
did , for
's home with two children , so
new career
new career
had been down here to visit
and that 's how it worked out .
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus .
it 's a nice place ,
that 's a nice place , though .
lived to the west of it
the county
all around there
sort of .
lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes
it was
it was only four miles to work
being on the lake like that
all the time you 're on a vacation because you 're right on a lake
and everybody 's
the winter over the time
and out there
be out there on all those lakes
there are lots of really small ones out there .
a mile , two long .
that is enough to do some boating
that 's right .
it was and lots of fun .
that 's right .
so it 's probably , out in that direction
could probably name after all these years
but it was just lots of little lakes
, and it was a little more expensive to live , of course
but just thought
a lot of people did n't really
but there was quite a few lakes all around there .
were living on an island
so much water around
was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from the city limits
and it was really nice out there .
there was so things around there .
really was pretty nice
and is n't where they have a summer music festival there , too ?
the winter time and in make snow and they have a ski slope .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
we did n't do a lot of it ,
always so .
so it was nice .
then it but
and it would melt or and
the kids when they were young would just go nuts and .
it lasted only a few hours ,
it was by noon gone .
, somebody telling me
was laughing , going that 's a good practical joke , and
said they really , there 's snow
and there were but a very short time
the weather got so warm quick and
known
is not too much fun
that 's not either fun ,
our house , is kind of little on a hill
just down
go and if it is , we say cold out .
think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there
think it is fun ,
the ice are pretty bad , sometimes
.
we got a pickup twice a week that came
and they take it .
it 's a week and twice ?
all of our trash in green bags
and they have now these large green containers
but they 're planning on doing it very soon .
and so that put off .
my kids
do they ?
put it that way .
they have been recycling cans for extra money .
that 's been their money summer so
that 's great .
that 's the way we started too .
and she had to earn money for it
so , that 's how she started .
she started recycling cans
the same way as
we get paid for the only thing
my husband become hooked on recycling
we do n't so and
but that 's
it is not really
it 's amazing
at how many cans that we got
when the kids went down first said that is great
supplement when they turned in them it
how fast it and but accumulate .
it 's really .
all that stuff
reduce our waste that we 're generating a week
they were
but they were picking up only once a week .
and it 's amazing really .
the other thing he does , that 's a real stickler my husband about we do n't collect our clippings grass .
once a week and .
often that more
and it 's amazing ,
it 's amazing .
we do n't collect of that any
a lot in
we do n't catch either , mainly because my husband rarely have time to mow the yard it .
and ca n't mow the yard with the grass catch on it
it 's too heavy .
and just so
it sure does .
it sure does .
it really do
they say you 're if you 're catching your clippings grass wasting fertilizer actually .
it 's amazing .
it better doing it
cuts down
that 's true .
zip through it and .
that 's true .
that 's true .
hooked on plastics and paper before
we will probably .
it is not really that much trouble .
in the garage a bag garbage
as soon as use we and up
they have the containers that you can go over there and drop in it just
and it 's really no trouble .
feel like we at least
a magazine article
it seems like a small contribution
but it 's not .
and maybe it 's when a big deal .
is how big when
and they do n't have any place to put it
and it just float , in the
and that 's not really necessary .
it is n't really
it would make a big difference if everybody would do just a little bit .
it would make a huge impact .
because it 'll be easier for us that much ,
and pick just
it is convenient for them to do it out here .
what do they pick up ?
, the glass , and the newspaper
?
and you do
or do you just put all in it .
and .
but they 'll do the aluminum too cans
but we do n't give them those .
the kids
so you 're doing that now ?
you 're doing the newspapers and the glass ?
we do n't take when , neither one of us .
we do n't so
, when it first started at first , it was
my husband would come home and go through the trash and say , , you threw this away .
he would get all upset
it 's just such an automatic reaction .
thought before we and now .
it is .
it 's really funny .
into the habit of it
it 's just making it a habit that are hard .
known
, in the trash going do n't do that
and go
they put , and
let them
after they and then take them all outside
put them and
they and then out
them and then .
go there and crush
that is fun .
that 's a lot of fun .
that 's a lot of fun .
that 's great .
is
and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans .
and making the decision on a family basis
you have to go through that process
not so much personally
always in the same town
live down station in college where too
and they put in a home last year .
of light strokes a
so that they put in last year
it was a physical decision pretty much ?
and drove a car , and everything
then she was starting to lose sometimes which are kind of frightening when she is in the car memory
my husband 's family
but it 's so difficult .
in favor of it was she
or she was
it was n't a very strong stroke .
she was n't herself anymore
she got kind of fearful and .
never really very well
it was one thing .
she took ever hardly care of herself
and she did n't eat .
she very poor
bad nutrition on
she did n't want to
elderly people do n't so often
a lot of
is a trust officer
so often they think they are adequately caring for themselves when they 're not really eating balanced very much or very meals and
she was almost ridiculous .
she 'd eat ice cream and cookies .
that is part of the aging process , that your buds taste goes back .
it 's really .
she did n't
that is too much trouble .
that is too much trouble .
did n't
right now
and are not
that a really good way
all you just as a family visited so
there was n't a whole lot of choice or probably in college station .
do n't
and have different degrees of a place that she was in
she was
and so there was a lesser care .
she broken
and then she was n't
of saying she ca n't be here anymore
whether the type of facilities and .
people there going to steal their items
that 's a given .
they 're always saying that somebody , is going to
sometimes , and the help there do it .
so , they do n't have too many facilities for their personal items , .
space very limited waste
all they but at least
and eat some good meals
'll be with other people
.
understand that , they do n't want to be with anybody else
was as in the business trust
have seen so many elderly people and
, if to do n't make late so you
they are able to move while they are still independent and social still in
things group and .
the steps without change much so next
moving out of the home they 've been always
it 's really kind of difficult .
my aunt 's mother 's got ill recently
and they 're saying ,
and women like that , you have ,
like it seems , very reluctantly ,
they do n't get out of the house ,
they do n't
but it is my home
and do n't want to leave it
the first step in
you know that it 's going to be downhill on just once you make that step
and have seen the change
in fact , that 's what 's going to happen with my husband 's mother probably .
of forcing somebody to do something
but it 's
they ca n't get out and see
's and it hard for someone like me to understand that
i thought , what
it 's a house ,
it is walls
it is furniture and
but there are nobody there .
not independence .
you want to be close to me
they stay in that building just
there is no family there , and
they do n't get see ,
they do n't get to see ,
they .
and is n't really there
it 's tough ,
it 's really .
that 's from the child 's standpoint .
, why do you want to be close to me , and other your family going
what does that house got attraction ?
being dependent on somebody .
they 're really proud of independence
being a burden to family members .
my husband 's mother will have major surgery
and we 'll find out about it in a casual conversation .
let she
we 'll and say , wait .
that 's it , and
did n't want to bother you
, who took care of her she got home
she stayed in .
living far from her
she is down in temple
and we ca n't see her enough to know what 's going on really often .
so , it is difficult ,
it 's really
and we 're all heading
in college station
hold them there in
so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here .
that before
you do have children ?
did n't know if that would make
think it 's a good idea
think everybody should , put in their time to speak for the good of the nation and for the good of themselves so
what this country is all about
believe strongly in
had opportunities in high school , in some programs work and
you did ?
you said it benefits the person
think it gives you a better perspective , on life and
and it gives you a little bit
and it certainly would help the country , too .
used to go through , but
they did , for things for people for their communities , for their , families .
the i question
people were
do n't think it would stay negative very long if you went in with a negative attitude
that 's true probably
even through those groups , but you do
not as much as
seemed more common in the last two decades
think that 's true probably
think it 's probably true , still more in the smaller communities in the larger cities then
what part of the country ?
so we 're not far apart .
there are the possibility that it could be out of the area
even about it being out of the area
but you 're right .
a small real town
back then it was
as far as doing things for them , and then gaining benefits from it now
and maybe this would
and in the last decade or two that 's true , it seems
that is a way , maybe
if young people had to do it that would start the trend back .
to
to
is not sure today 's kids would go for it , though ,
think you would have to start younger
do n't know how young you 'd have to go
think it 's too late now
they are things around the home even just starting
little ones can do a little bit to help the family .
just watching the parents and too it can start a pattern
there is always something , no matter how young ,
that develop that attitude
would like to see this happen with more families really
think this is a possible way to handle it certainly
in families
think that 's a good place to start again and
if not sure , you 're going to do it for anybody else
where there are so much they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world 's when
be sure , not even one percent of the world 's fortunate as these areas as
that is probably true .
that is probably true .
our church youth group
they 've done this for fourteen years now .
that 's great .
there is a different way of life
every youth are gone ever
and it is
and that 's the just two weeks during the summer .
that 's great .
the youth involved in that sort of thing
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes .
you did have anything else ?
that is about all
talking with you
good talking with you
i hope and you have a good evening .
too you
we are supposed to discuss the school system
that should n't be too much trouble for the two of us .
as many years as we
in , even though that
some major problems with dropouts but from talking .
they did n't even show up for class and sometimes
and they did n't just
that are really sad
they do n't even come
just working in high school that students and recently .
for , but that was very possible handling a job , and it seemed to have other factors .
think so too .
their plans after high school
what 's and their home situation .
is the home
the main goal is making money now and
and it may be a thing for the family , when you can understand survival .
this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now ,
but that the most important thing is still getting your education .
your education .
when they said , my first impulse was it is n't really what is wrong with the public schools
it is what is wrong with families .
that 's right .
it is what is wrong with families
they do n't know what to expect at home .
they do n't feel secure there ,
of their apartment complex
was for example that child
how they can concentrate on schooling ?
with you
think that 's the main problem
educate the kids and try to provide them with some security
and that 's
at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids
last year and was the first year that we had ever more than one counselor .
and that is really just not enough .
it is n't .
somebody who in a middle school teaches to
said they at a tougher and rougher age and all that and
there be a counselor at least
and we have recently at just a counselor .
we did n't even
had three at middle schools , though , because we have a thousand about kids
they between three counselors up and
for every year but they 'd have a different counselor
and they decided that did n't work .
here .
more security in
if they have a rapport with their counselor .
hope they have the flexibility to be able to change
to change
and that happens occasionally .
but , it 's frightening
because , 's education
it 's certainly .
getting their education , for one reason or another ,
that 's right .
what 's going to happen to them ?
they going to be the thieves and the people in prison
faster then we can build up
that 's no good .
is on for my school that campus strategic planning committee
they have all these different names for things , strategies and all these different things .
one of the key things were anyway , but we believed the public education is the best economic value
then think they decided to strike economic
anyway , is what happens when public education fail ?
then people will go to private schools ?
what kind of a situation
we and in to private schools
think one thing that we 'll see is that we wo n't be educating everybody
the things that
we try to educate everyone .
that 's right .
that 's right .
we are only in the world do the country .
higher if they are willing to work and have some ability
they can do that .
believe it 's something like that ,
it is worded .
and do n't know
that is so important ,
then that helped a lot .
think the gang violence are scaring everyone to death too
it 's scary .
really a frightening situation
in situations and schools to be where to do n't see that we .
my mother was teacher for years , and years
and they are talking a lot about the situation school there , too .
shall up
the amount of time necessary
we have to
'll so
was n't at church
how exciting
is n't ?
is that
what an experience .
an old experienced hand
do that at all
have until they were two private care for both my daughters and
and it was a wonderful environment .
all kids could have that kind of place , if ,
.
so , it worked well .
about how you ?
have a year old nine old and a year six
in , care for the reason of me days working
they went , but both .
it 's hard to find not .
so many of the churches have out
half day programs .
and this is one of the few churches that did it .
could n't just
there was so real continuity .
her diapers changed when she was three
so , it was
but it was because they have a director who have always done it as a labor of love
that 's a big drawback in the , public schools ,
you 're lucky to have an art teacher
them once a week or something and if
or pay for it after school .
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take
is that right ?
had no idea
but make
the schools than
with our budget cuts and is sure that 's not going to change anytime soon
that 's the only way they 're going to be able to do it .
their kids to have any humanities and .
so , the day schools do in some ways serve those purposes .
that 's true .
put the colors away
get out the computers
which is too bad .
that is hard .
it 's so difficult for them .
you did have your children , private care in
that was in your home or in someone else 's home ?
until they were two .
both times they were at our house .
you were so
and that was too hard .
lucked out with really good people both times
so many people
'd practically give my paycheck to do it away , and
or did you 've someone who lived in with you ?
she did n't live with us .
because my kids have never
that was so as well
, was just this morning listening to a program
it was on the home show ,
ca n't even think of the name of it
put together for parents and children
leaving a week three old and taking them and leaving them there
that would be hard .
a lot more left
we have more options now then we did when my kids , was born
that 's great .
it is
have just three days a week
they have schedule or from a pay standpoint .
we try to work with their hours it .
and the bank has a lot of programs for now referrals child care .
of course it is too late for me
have not so
think we finally is beginning to make progress , but not just very fast , but
it 's amazing .
it 's too late , and for our age group
too little , too late
more of us going to have to work
two families income here to stay
work in big business
they have children .
so it 's only to their advantage , they get
and
so .
it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time .
that 's good .
because that are hard .
that 's good to know .
to when they are young until they hit the preschool age to take a private home
you 'll find usually a woman who are keeping six children , or four to six children in the home
my future sister-in-law 's mother and too that do .
kept finding neighbors and friends and
and they 'd move .
she ended up being every year in a different home .
transit too
and then her have them
are we
you do
not all the time
's kind of that way , too
have time
meals three a day
about to be
kind of
is
five .
we have four ,
two of them and
fairly soon that because
they ?
they get and
we have too that problem .
also , but it is now
it 's just absolutely incredible .
that 's my oldest nine
and he already do that .
do
told him that he is going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reach so he can eat teenage years and
that 's true .
for special stuff
have and
and he does the steak
and it 's real good .
how
that is our favorite , dinner and .
that sound good
i love that
my husband really like seafood .
we do so .
what do , n't serve enough of it , really
did n't grow
, and so do n't know
just kind of
but like
and do n't know ,
it 's called stew seafood
and it is
it is not the one with all the shells and stuff in it
do n't
n't either
it 's really good
one thing that 's good 's , and it makes a large amount .
usually so we and
two of it i containers freeze and
then that is just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice .
but neither of my kids , will eat it
it defeats the purpose .
it really do .
have them ?
my husband make those .
does he .
, do n't know
it is the texture or something
but everyone else in my family do .
is that he uses ?
, do n't know
, do n't know what
do n't know
and is the only one including my mom and dad and my brother
is the only one who do n't eat it
is n't that something ?
my kids but .
was
that 's one thing that
think it 's good for company , too , but
made a few times
needed to make something to give somebody to take over to somebody 's house or something else
makes it , a lot because you can feed your own family
what does it have in it ?
you can use chicken or turkey ,
stuff in
is not real good about measuring
.
the best ones
but it 's just chicken ,
that 's it , and
some hard-boiled eggs and
that sounds good .
and is that it .
those good
and is that it .
that sounds good .
because of the rice
the rice before
would use the new mayonnaise now
that ?
told my husband , i love to eat chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that this summer
known
and it is now
used to put in a tiny bit just
now is just putting more and more in
do n't like salad tuna unless it 's got lots of mayonnaise in it
and it is now twelve .
known
the best thing
is
.
with my kids n't
sugar and stuff enough
mine bouncing normally off the walls anyway
they do n't and
when we 're at home with sweets and stuff here , so we do n't really do that much
going to their grandmother 's house , which is every weekend
that 's when they would say , pig out , as our family .
that 's good .
that 's what exactly is it .
one of my boys that is , twelve have high cholesterol .
have you found out about your kids ever .
.
and my one other does not .
year or so ago he found out
did and and on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down !
he was able to get it down .
mostly because we 've never really eaten in cholesterol things high
he never be eaten any eggs .
have never
bought butter and things like that
but he left again just for the doctor
and it is kind of back up .
so he needs to be careful again .
so we really have been talking about the for him to be sure to eat foods
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff
and he is so eating an apple a day for the last two days .
all that kind of stuff really do and help .
have probably
too far away
that is unusual .
have been so far east coast people
's see
changes
social changes
who is that
think we can handle
there are plenty of things to talk .
go ahead
you want to go ahead and start
were hoping that you would
that involve a lot of different areas .
, is even
there 's a big difference in the economic status of people .
there is perhaps of the middle range then there was less .
people starting to give up hope
start and out very poor
see 's
have children three
and we 're home schooling .
thinking about a lot
change a lot
in the world around them and because of their parents and things
a lot of these things that have been happening , such as the day-care centers and things , having a big effect on the social changes
not because , they are learning the values they need learn .
they do n't have and the self-esteem that they need have
dealing with the things in the world
rebellion and things
that 's a pretty big change .
that 's very , young for a baby .
that 's really sad .
they have to
think if they really tried , they would n't have to
maybe companies would start paying more so their wives could stay home and have more a solid foundation for the kids men if
like you said they might be saving money ,
higher productivity is even though it 's short-term .
that 's right .
it already costs because of it much more society .
became
they do n't want to stay home with the kids or something like that .
a lot of two parent situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants to do
rather she needs just she want the money
she particularly have the money
a small for money
do so it partly because of the money but partly for herself too
it is interesting ,
is what you said
home school
home school
busy sound
you 're teaching them , completely , so
popular then more
home schooling is always been around
more and more families going because of the problems in the schools
and a lot of it is
have been in day-care centers
it 's really obvious to look at them and the way to watch they act and things .
with the schools change
going anywhere else , in the homes before anything change
when they are young ,
is the home
it is the basic unit .
and that is where it starts all
maybe is part of that better educating parents and .
changing people 's expectations
some classes for kids to give them an idea of what family life is like and that kind of thing in high schools and things
enjoy eating out here and there ,
it or is eating at home
like a variety of restaurants
enjoy sometimes and having a formal meal going out
go out and have a salad
,
or you go out without them with the children
a variety
like to go sometimes without them
and sometimes , it is to take them along
so it just vary ,
a mix
with just my husband
it would n't matter which restaurant was it really , and even
just to have a moment of peace quiet without little ones at the table
are times next to a table with other children
this is our night out .
but anyway where do you like to eat ?
we do n't have any children
we to like to try all sorts of different things
and we 're
get down and with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that
out one to two times a week
which you do
it 's been a long time since we have been in there
but it 's good .
have
have n't been in there
it is good .
my husband have been several times in there
and we went actually in there for lunch one day .
that is one of a lot to me that the things , a good pasta means .
different kinds of food
you 're
things and once in .
but we 'll try anything .
do n't think so
but , we really do enjoy going out
traditional it can backfire .
think we are supposed to say what will bring back to a restaurant or what attract us to a restaurant us
how do you usually find a new restaurant ?
my husband he is the ethnic fan .
do n't know
you know ,
the magazine
we do so .
ratings of restaurants
when a new restaurant open up , they usually send out coupons .
that 's right .
it 's hard to resist ,
so we 'll go in .
very often and we 'll find ,
and we 'll stick with it
once they give no longer coupons .
find half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper reviews probably
we use the coupons , too .
that 's true .
that 's true .
, particularly if you have more than two people and you 've got four or something like that
it 's very expensive to go out to eat .
it is almost a hobby with us .
it 's sort of a recreation
just a change of pace from eating at home
the dishes
the dishes
we have experience with that
it may help their tip , may not .
what 's your favorite restaurant ?
we never have been there .
you would like it .
and that 's
we 've taken people there several times
a good choice of
you call it
and then
we 've been back , and
it is in the winter season
they have when we have been back , it
but , you ought to try that .
it 's very good .
probably would like that
do n't
be a wonderful place
my husband particularly like that .
that 's good .
have been there
you ready ?
what have you lately seen ?
it is funny ,
make the called the other days
i
is
it was really good .
and we all liked it .
everyone and enjoyed it .
is
went to dinner with some friends last weekend
said it so bad and
on , choir tour and visiting friends and one thing , and another
finally , it is my first movie summer .
let
right before my girlfriend , said
we 're going to the movies .
she goes all the time
every once of months
go and two at a time .
that was good ?
we laughed , so hard
you could n't hear because everyone in the audience was so hard laughing half the dialogue .
i love comedies
that is the one other that we went to that night .
it was ?
and course , growing up on the back of a horse and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was true so
in the aisles absolutely
it was so funny .
both of them was great .
good .
we so hard
they just carried , off to the tee it .
how
and we did n't think we 'd have much chance of getting in
but we thought we 'd try it ,
free movie .
it was so funny
we hurt by the time we came out .
think it 's
think it 's
cause it 's just a light comedy fun summer ,
it was especially in the theater contagious
is glad that you did before your surgery
could live through it now
is getting around real good
and is
work and two weeks after
but do n't have permanent work
right now is working with a temporary agency
all the software for
was up there half a day
wanted to work a day
and went
the whole weekend to recover from that it took me and of course .
and worked ever since about three days a week , two to three days a week
are you just
just ca n't get over this
he says , you can go back to doing your normal crazy things in two weeks .
if , you can go play ball .
he says , you 're going to feel like playing ball
but if you can .
can now see it just
says he and you just take it easy for two weeks more so
you 've got only two weeks more .
will
'll do it
because this is not cutting it just find a job
those funny ones and so are
think he needs a comedy , too
but know that ,
company , when this summer ,
we really are enjoying it
's just not enough time to do it all but
and he knew he could n't get them in all realistically .
he sound like the critics
the plot line and the characters real big
but the fire scenes and that action part 's fantastic .
it was then you 'd expect , real different
but he enjoyed it
, went
me too
and
.
was
it was ,
and we wanted to take
we really wanted him to see it
just thought that was terrific
, too
think he is really good
do n't think
would n't think
their dad 's tomorrow night to
may go do that so
that one wo n't .
do you do a lot of dining out ?
although
more when we have company
about what you ?
some out
a lot of
is so mostly when it
we do n't too often go out unless it 's a fast-food kind of thing as a family .
but we do enjoy dining out .
have you ever been there ?
have
but have n't been there
, is about
have you ?
you did like it ?
.
one time when my father was visiting
we all there and
and their seafood was
it is
it is really a great place .
they then and separate
and loved them both
really .
they are
that is our favorite .
have you been there ?
is really too good
it is
is the only thing
you have to expect to wait at least an hour .
you 're going to be sitting there for an hour
that you know , it be okay
but they have just about the best anywhere in the area prime rib .
.
and , my husband really like their ribs .
go in
there for an hour
and then we get there
we do n't look at the menu and even .
you know right away .
know right away
we really enjoy too prime rib
actually here that we have gone to , and
and the time we went the prime rib was really good .
it was ?
been
but never have been there for dinner
and , it was good ,
that 's great .
that is , great .
have too
have you been there ?
but .
even less than
and did n't
have
have been there never
have , but
you there be
lunch primarily
sometimes and breakfast
the specials
keep hearing about it
keep hearing the advertisements of it
and they keep
it is
have not been over there
and not have been there
either , have n't
place ,
have only and
went with a friend , but
have been there
that was nice .
it was
mushroom soup
and they did .
it was
room for the dessert , which was a chocolate sack , and so had just soup and salad .
have
like a bag paper
and we shared one , the three of us
it was because it was very rich and plenty
'd have a camera but
it was beautiful .
bet it was
bet it was
we took with us another friend and
and it was outstanding .
it sounds
it was relatively simple really
but it was good .
it was really good .
the things that
fresh berries
always their fruits and .
do n't know ,
they must have a special source for getting because even at the farmer 's market you ca n't find them
you ca n't find them .
was home and a few years
and was
they were real , real pretty
the service
do n't know
there are so much competition that they have to be good , really
would miss that really
too would
because we do n't very often go out .
and it 's a whole experience .
the food to be good
the atmosphere and service too important
and in order to survive in this area .
just do n't make it
is a little off the beat track
but it 's
where do you live ?
where do you live ?
the air pollution are n't too bad in our area .
so , we are very fortunate
but , it 's really bad .
something we were watching the other day
never have been out there ,
it was a real brown area
either have n't
live in an area like that
a lot of
a lot of coal and oil more up north , i guess
think it 's a bigger problem
it was once , from the cars , because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area
and they 're doing that now
in that particular part of the country , that 's the only pollution that 's been there
it is not an area 's industry
from acid rain ?
i guess
the car give from something that
in the emissions thought
the rain fall on
you 've seen what it is done to buildings even where it 's really bad .
power , the companies and about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there were and there was
at the topic of acid rain and up , one person was a speaker brought
you 're making a mountain out of a molehill , kind of thing .
so , it 's kind of the interesting change in perspective .
a lot of people
bomb not quality is
so with all our controls in the united states
and , it does n't pollute the air at all .
it is to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a plant coal safer .
in and dealing with plants around nuclear plants then coal ever
kind of because it is .
so do n't know
do n't know what the answer is so
, of course , the best answer would
a problem on
get that sometimes ,
my line got some static .
do n't
thought and our part of the country was ideal oddly
ca n't hear at all for all this static you
it is usually
it must be on the line , just .
you can hear me ?
can now again
do n't know what the problem is
think this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
other areas
, we have a tremendous amount of sunny days
it can be used
and it can help
but that was a problem that they were still working on .
it is still got a long way to go .
maybe in some ways to help
may not in all ways
maybe they 'll be able to control it up .
do n't know how long that 'll take ,
, but one of these days ,
because that is perfectly clean .
it 's just we ca n't control it .
right now it takes
so , it is n't ,
not at all ,
so that 's not going to work .
now at least not .
as far as energy goes ,
, with solving some of the future energy problems we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well
so i hope
to
like to be optimistic ,
do n't like to be pessimistic about these things
we have earth , live on one
and we got to take care of it .
for the future generations , too .
so , if we can raise generations with those concerns , and we 'll solve a lot of our problems .
was part of the generation me where people did n't care
it is
if it 's a problem , forget that .
not to throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and throw away then it ?
horrible how
how do you feel about capital punishment ?
are pretty much against it
about how you ?
are pretty much for it
we can have a debate .
we 'll have some interesting discussion , i guess .
, do n't know
are afraid of someone wrongly losing their life ,
.
for the punishment
thought about it , but then
would feel at losing my mother someone else
, somebody love them
it would never be equal ,
about how you ?
there is , maybe
do n't know
that 's true .
he is going to be , to me , a functioning part of society and never .
, do n't know
and he is done for the things ,
, do n't know
put him in jail for the rest of his life or capital punishment either
or whatever
we do n't have enough room in the jails left
people crime and still are climbing
of capital punishment , i guess
there is always chance that
'd to some people
do n't know
they wo n't really do for any situation that
it is
rehabilitate too him
again out
nobody wants and that .
to death
and right
is the justice here
having not even
that 's true .
is not sure what their policy is on capital punishment
that was one of the questions and
and , i guess , do you think it should be restricted ?
a lot of states still do practice capital punishment
making the most sense
violent crimes with
because i thought capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case
he pretty much confessed to it .
have a hard time , especially if
hang
because that is just awful .
and what is he going to do to the other people ?
, do n't know
jail about life is not any way to live .
but do n't know
she was off drugs and everything ,
in prison you can get anything but she said .
you can .
it 's just like being outside .
ways around
and there 's a power structure that you 've
, as bad for , and it is n't really ,
should be for the aspect punishment
against punishment and more towards rehabilitation
crime gone up , because it 's not so scary anymore
like repeat offenders especially
is they and what
and , it 's really scary .
do n't know what the perfect solution to that is
capital punishment in a case like that
both participating in this survey
and she picked up the phone
when she heard the topic , capital punishment , she said , and
it to you
.
so , she tried to enter her number
it would n't work and
she said , so it is for you .
, but do n't know
i struggle with it ,
think it might not be such a bad thing in terms of like this
is
to death
, maybe if they have more money or more resources to work
my favorite type of music , is classical music
orchestral classical music
and that 's my favorite type .
the favorite instrument would probably be the violin .
really do n't have a favorite ,
like everything
have to pick
but like
so , it 's kind of sometimes hard to choose .
listening good jazz and what is not , what 's
enjoy , but it
fiddle music
and we bought his tape
lucky you thing
so , we used to go and listen to them all the time
still my parents and .
grew up with a lot of his music and what not
a lot of classical music
he introduced , and to a lot of it both
then , too , you grew up with his children ?
did
small world ?
we all went to high school together
and we 're still
parents ' houses on the weekends and what to
played violin in the orchestra for several years ,
it is a small world
small world
he 's a pretty nice guy .
most of the time
have
would want to work and never
life just took different
it did n't work out to do now that just so .
so , he is ready to retire about ,
another year
he is sure ,
he just became a grandfather .
heard that
it was really nice
it was a boy , or a girl ?
he is a little boy .
what did they name him ?
what she named him ,
of course .
with an e
ca n't remember
it real well , of course
do you have a favorite instrument ?
really like ,
you did ?
which were real nice .
and it was real nice ,
that a lot .
and it played by itself ?
somebody played it .
just by itself ,
just by itself
it was real nice .
i bet that was .
it went well ,
but did n't recognize the name
it was real nice .
in a string quartet who plays at weddings often the violin
think it 's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano always so
and , it makes it nice .
you can
it makes something else or to have an elegant wedding .
it does .
it really do
such a different to it
it is kind of haunting on some of the notes .
like
n't know
husband and wife that we 've known for years
and we try to make what 's going on and too stuff
big into too music
he does n't play anything ,
but , he just like to listen .
certain types of music and favorite songs
full blast
it does offer band or some of the instruments ?
my oldest is only nine .
music class
but he 's not enough old yet to get into the band yet .
think that starts in sixth grade
probably
but do n't know
cause my brother plays ,
and do n't know if he is serious about it really yet or not ,
is going to wait and see if he is interested in something just
you got a little ways to go , too .
just a little bit
that 's my oldest eight
what we 've and started her on piano ,
but , it 's been fun ,
a lot of
but it 's
it 's been fun ,
about the piano
a lot about playing the piano
make me a little and
so , it 's
will be interested in it
see 's
our bags paper up in the garage for glass , plastics
in the part of town where they 've got into the other containers yet for recycling you
did n't think anybody have those at all yet
maybe n't
that was supposed to be in may
and could n't tell whether some parts of town have started it or if it was just everybody was waiting for the delivery of what was those containers
, have n't seen
have all
they look like
and , is kind of anxious to see
i look at our big green containers
they work fine
see how well that work
and is glad the community is doing it
it is
do n't know what you saw back years ago ,
all pop bottles had a deposit on them .
of course .
that , they did .
to our house in glass bottles
of the house the
you just so put back out there and the empty ones
another gallon of bottling glass in there and .
back at
they were doing things that we should be doing now then
a good turn here
and then it went away
this time it stay .
stacks and stacks of newspapers are just amazing .
and then take them ,
and dumping glass and dumping plastics
is so that
did n't know what to expect
but do n't have any habits there yet on
and is waiting
it seems like just in our society
they will shortly
outside little my town , and so we would go out and look for long bottling neck beer because they were worth something
and do n't know if there 's a deposit on those or not
they 're back , you 're saying ?
see 's
they 'd be ounce maybe six or ten ounce .
we did n't stop and look at a long time them and
the old sort of a basket thing type
the paper carton
had n't seen in a long time that
a lot of the things we need do , we were doing
is not really going back to good old days , and
we think we should do now them
your husband really do n't like the paper sacks
he does n't like the paper sacks
but he likes to pick the grass up , too .
, but do n't believe in throwing into the landfill it
but most of us do n't have the sufficient , lot size to do that .
so are glad to be willing to take the city on
that 's nice .
the same place
wonder
and so are
you of keep in just have so
and then who
they have , now that this day .
it 's one thing to send grass there ,
really have n't seen lately ,
was so when the computer picked this one
have n't been to the movie theater here in about six months ,
that the last movies
a lot of videos too
have little two babies
and we saw one movie recently
's kind of blood and guts
particularly do n't care for that sort of stuff
n't either
he does n't .
their knee caps for the most part
saw sleeping with the enemy
, saw it
have n't seen yet that one
and couple weeks ago
by several people that it 's pretty scary and intense
and was
it 's a good movie ,
there for my expectations in it
with all the commercials and everything
we want to see one
but , we have n't seen , either one that yet .
, have n't seen either
it 's a good movie , but it is long ,
three hours .
that is , too
get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay late to watch it up
that 's right .
that 's right .
supposed to be his debut in comedy
which was an interesting movie , but not very funny .
see my daughter that
she and liked it
she did ?
it was an amusing movie .
around watching it with no one else to
course and of watch all these movies like look who are talking and look who are talking , too
have a year old ten
a lot of movies around that category that she can watch
my son turned just two
did n't hear that was coming out
it come out on
and ca n't think
they have just the movie rescuers
that was out just
he does n't sit still for the whole movie , yet
but he likes to listen to the music and stuff if there 's a lot of that in the movie .
glad to know there are somebody else out there who do n't get to go to the movie theater
tell ,
just small babies
, and tell
we really want to go a lot
than you can go see it out
that 's right .
go and then to the dollar movies
that seems to happen .
and someone said that was a lot of fun to go do .
while have dinner and everything
thought that might be kind of fun to do
that does sound fun .
.
but
'd like to get out to the movies more often really
now , too that you ca n't
discount tickets where my husband work ,
but that it seems like it just than other , is so expensive .
almost you ca n't afford to do it .
that 's right .
we went on vacation couple months ago ,
that was fun .
of that movie
down the house or something
that is the one .
forgot just the title of it
be a real scary one
have seen
ca n't remember the title of it , either
an impression
seems to be a topic that 's going to take probably
and we may have to do out of necessity as far as moving up time schedule that it .
it does seem to be a lot of habits to break .
, was n't as a kid on it raised
my kids but
and they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that , was one of the first things to do so
we were doing all right until the prices dropped out there and
and they were n't worth anything anymore .
it took us , almost a year to get a garbage sack full .
we just do n't drink that many .
a or for whatever occasion of pepper doctor or something
and we came out , with about a dollar
it was n't just really worth it .
of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old .
that was a big deal ,
but we decided it was n't worth us keeping it
and throw them in there
least it got back into the system ,
the city wants to pick up
have all you got the individual containers yet ?
is not sure what we 're going to have to do , whether we have three separate containers , all
really do n't understand
if i recall , it 's been a long time .
they are way behind schedule on that particular part of it .
they were fine on the big green containers
the rate of getting it success
and run through it
, but do n't know
the entire week 's worth of trash for a house
that 's true .
was brought long time ago , up that they did n't even have cans
they have bottles
and you 'd return them to the grocery store
and you 'd get our money back
and that were all good and well .
they do n't seem to be still doing that .
if they could eliminate the cans and use glass , just
this day and age
they do n't do that .
to a set of railroad tracks
a very popular thing for people by that highway driving by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to break them there
but they were n't that successful ,
a lot of
to just and up enough to buy for the day
so that they do n't care ,
they can get more somewhere else .
i wonder ,
we crushing cans
would say in the last three years
where do you take your cans ?
takes as to build up it
you do
subscribe to any magazines at home
.
of course , anything that appeals to the homemaker since that 's my main line of interest .
and to a working woman or something
of course , is one of those who do things at once two ,
kind of and
and then you stopped them all .
but
the subscriptions ran out
renewed them and never
time at home since i work , read them and .
get of and then turned off by it
for that kind of sets
so many things that
travel and we
on in the various different ones travel parts
, and get
that kind of tell you
put down
might then read something , and if something caught my eye
otherwise they were not useful to me , too , but
is that
got some good recipes from them , sometimes
recipes
and you save them forever
and you never really use them .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
every so often and then
did put that recipe ever
but that 's my on short subject reading and things like this whole idea mainly .
said to
on the newsstands or something like that while that new magazine and in a
have since i work with computers during my work to keep up on the new computer equipment and software and everything all
be a very long time , probably , before
know if you 're in public transportation sometimes will people read them on something like that
dump them at
and do n't have to carry them back with me
that 's right .
that when
no matter what it 's
air travel or anything
that 's when you 've really time .
somewhat got into computer work ,
we have our own computer system at home
would get more from it
and it was
of a little bit more than i what
did so never get into them
was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail when
, we have a live one
'll
but they were wrong .
never got into them
our conversation at
it was nice talking .
talk with you , too
thank you .
the issue aids is a bit of a problem .
who first my mind is the thing
on such a problem
at least the rumor that we 're not spending as much per
take breast cancer , for instance
more than aids affected many people
yet more people and
aids have more money than breast cancer .
, that is n't it ,
if it is true .
have always
dig it out and make sure
we think that 's the world 's worst thing
is so give money to aids
we and yet have breast cancer problems for years
course , one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it does n't .
what did you think about that idea ?
a lot of men in control of that kind of thing
then , but the killer number of men one seems to be the prostate
developed a test for the in the blood antigen antibody
that 's recent and fairly .
from prostate cancer for years
they have not really either given it attention ,
so it 's
it 's not
that seems to be one of the major problems that men have in the realm of cancer , and then
so do n't know
is just some strange public opinion as
it is kind of hard to get an even keel on that .
it 's hard to say really ,
a hundred thousand per
let 's give it this amount , so
other this one is only a tenth of that , and then
just keep doling out it
who is in charge of making those
for all these problems because they are so serious all
it 's not so serious until it affect your family
of all and then it is the most important thing .
would so hate to have just personally that responsibility
, but again , then we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address
's many of those things if they are not able to be insured then the country and
we 're going to end up
that 's true .
it 's so , as it was , kind of a unfair advantage
but wonder if there is n't enough money in our economy or in our system
things to do n't really do a whole lot of good
they are kind of nice .
if we might wind up with a cure for just about everything
of course , then we would n't have any room to put people ,
change just a little bit our priorities
these ridiculous figures for pizza
these phenomenal amounts of
and then you have
for the masses
'll start first off
absolutely no problem with
an awful lot of time on the job traveling
particularly airline and
much more comfortable than
so do n't really have a problem with it
n't either
do n't work ,
home with my children
but my husband work
and they do have that at his place of employment
and neither of us have a problem with it .
you just do n't
there have been so many ,
for just that 's probably going on .
's supervisor of personnel for the world 's largest painting company safety ,
even in our field and we have
we do not , and at the present time ,
and is pushing towards that
they should n't have a problem with it
and then have to know , because we 're talking major liabilities if
but with other employees
doctors and airline pilots
something is going to happen
and they are showing it with aids ,
they ought to start doing something with the drugs .
have no problem with it really so
it 's unfortunate everyone does n't have .
it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that ,
and not
but those kind of i things 'd like to know myself .
had a lot of dental work done ,
the last dentist and did n't use even gloves at all ,
so that kind of thing really kind of me concerns
if that 's the way
was a dentist
you would think so .
and worked for a dentist
you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that
and it 's real , real dangerous .
would think ,
me crazy
's been doing and things like that
do n't know
they had it for several years
had a lot of problems associated with it ,
and it sounded very positive .
think it 's great and
would encourage it
is pushing our company towards that
from their employer and friends and family and things
too many people just dying
what the crime is like
but here is the rate crime
ours is changing .
ours is changing ,
it is increasing .
living in a very nice suburb
it 's unbelievable and what 's going on and the selling of drugs .
it 's just too loose .
it 's too free .
have very little two children , under two
got a piece of paper from my husband 's office , and
like a sticker
kind of fun is .
it 's best do when you have time leisure
my childhood days than
grew up in an area that was just a few feet from a rather large lake , and
a few miles from that more and was a even larger lake
and we have a variety of boats at our disposal .
worked for a camp for a number of years
my father , there were on staff
you name it , they have it
we did and a lot of , sports water .
we spent about a summer
and we have a real good time with it
if you got ever over , though , it was a mess to get back up
had this one
and sailing was kind of nice
work your way down a lake or work back against the wind up , as
more than once we 'd get out there and on a really stormy day
as soon as , and it was calm .
of with a paddle nowhere the
and that did n't always work .
but it 's a nice hobby to have .
could afford the boat or the time ,
to a lake that
i guess , things change .
your memories of
my husband 's family had a boat motor when
and they took out on the lake several times us .
and did really enjoy that
than ever learned to drive it or anything
we did , of course , driving around the lake in the boat
and the basic safety rules and i things just found
you like they did with
the laws was there
that 's true .
was real fun
learning how to ski
was seven or eight years
of the two we have the smaller access to
got and all ready to go
was down in the water
me a bit turtle in
it did n't hurt too much ,
but to it .
and the boat went off without me
reached back there
and , it did n't even leave a mark .
and told everybody what happened so
go and .
down and there in
'll be if he did n't do it again and
this time a little earlier
move over a few feet in the water
, did n't go very far
got up , but
long a nice ski career
about to do ,
and and jumping around here
doing much more than that
life change just a little bit in that respect .
allow you
managed to get a hold on that craft yet
that sounds like a real challenge .
kind of
had n't
do n't have anybody either to teach me
that 's little another thing .
somebody kind of tell you do what you
have seen , you just kind of work to it up your way
, but do n't know
where 's your favorite place to go ?
travel outside the united states
that 's great .
we have a year old nine .
have you ever been there ?
were both of my kids
this time we 're going to be going with just one daughter and
and she 's nine ,
so it ought to be just a ball .
too think so .
that 's great .
so we 've been there a number of times
and we 're going next year .
we have a trip business every fall .
on a lot of business trips
do n't work
so travel a lot .
.
a couple times a month
they do n't and in the position he 's in
it is so great .
just kind of up when it 's something interesting
and it will be at this time of the year
that will be fun , too .
have you ever been there ?
went years
we have n't been lately
it a lot changed
but we used to have a lot of fun there .
we went once there .
we were on our way home and
we were and driving
going along
hope it is swimming season
because it was n't
if there , there is n't much ,
but , that can
, like the night life to an extent
and is
they having so many activities and special shows
about of it all
if you are working , then you 're probably
not really ,
we are doing the same thing .
save and vacation for things like that just
just travel and we can .
heard my topic today
how easy
really our children and at
work well with this position he 's in really out just
going whether or not
do like to travel , but
do n't mind the pool life at all during the day
like to see sight and
and to shop .
that is perfect .
what you could ask ?
that 's right ,
and then got to pick and choose the places .
request that they send us just two of our coach tickets
a lot of
is they and
it is kind of shaky .
and , we better start using them .
that 's true .
it 's really .
it was fun and .
so and a really neat part of the country
the kids and was old enough to really enjoy it .
think that 's a good trip
a car for two weeks
and it was just great .
there are too much to see really .
would like car that get really good mileage and one that are really reliable something like an economy
thought probably not a new car brand
, of course , and .
what i and else do want .
it does
would be nice
it sounds like something your husband would drive ?
to work that are is for him to drive back and forth what it would be for
do n't think we 're looking for another car right now , because we just bought one ,
but we were looking for something that have enough seat when we were looking
and a speed five
and that was
that made economically better , but
that is something we might want is too some kind of standard transmission
another second car
and we 'd look for about what you 're looking for .
but too
it would n't
but ,
what it would still be nice enough
you like doors four would
or really does n't matter .
that would be a good idea , probably
it 's hard for people get sometimes in with a two door .
that 's right .
so if wanted to take we it is that
had n't
would be fun to win just one
would go for that
that would be great .
think that 's all that we need say
for called
we 'll talk later to you .
have of course
have n't and
there is a vast majority of the people at the company
do they feel that way ?
just because it 's a good idea
even though cause a lot of problems
, do n't know
but , yet that can , too .
think so it 's a good idea
do n't know their job would be at risk ,
them off of drugs
would think
through the program
and then six months after you complete the program
and then you if you 're .
draw a hard line
but is in favor of that type of thing
responsible for certain things
and you expect them to do their job
and it is possible that they ca n't do as a good job as they might do .
that 's right .
and , of course they can cause injury to other people also .
they could cause serious injury to another people .
and you never know
the deep on something that they are
and it would be out of the question .
that 's right .
a lot about drugs there
they start in the elementary schools down some programs
for drugs
many of them doing it
and do n't
that 's right .
and do n't know ,
just a problem that no one is sure
is for it
approximately a thousand dollars a person
it is
and
it 's very expensive .
did n't realize that it was that expensive
it 's very expensive to run them .
did n't get a raise this year , and
because , nobody in our company got a raise .
all the money on
just lucky to have jobs
if , and people could have got a raise .
have because there is really a problem
known and
have other views to it , but then
and he took another one
him do that since it was so close together both
because if it 's a thousand dollars , that 's a thousand dollars they wasted
not theirs might run a thousand dollars .
, do n't know
is that just
a lot of other tests
or maybe it 's under a health program type that it would catch a lot of things .
but
.
and ceramics
how great .
.
ceramic
more the china
the more china .
and do now that enjoy it
how you did ever get into that ?
that sounds so interesting .
my husband keep
he 's been dead now for twenty years , and
so you understand that this was a long time ago .
the china , the book , the brushes
arrangements for your lessons
'll do it for three months
if , and is that it .
painted an awful lot until his death , which were several years
do it just
or , do you do it to give as gifts
or do you actually sell it ?
sold quite a bit
and have their home ,
and then have just
you do work outside of the home ?
have
have
what a great hobby
it is a great hobby ,
but do n't retire .
do n't retire
home for the last about nine years
have
so the lake life appealed to me ,
and my husband is working
and to me if he left it up .
all my own clothes
we , recently purchased a new home and
but she china does n't painting
so we have both
that are excellent .
so we were right on the lake .
is that what
have but never
ever , to be sure , and start with a large flat plate if
into the delicate work
that 's right .
you did
china
how
we have so much fun there , then
and she would help us
we bought and lots of equipment from her , supplies
and it was just such a delightful time .
and it 's nice so ,
nice for you now , so that
put aside for
have just but
great to that is n't .
regain your enthusiasm for it really once
have two daughters and
a lot and out .
i travel ,
all your meals out
a lot of meals
is also
and my wife , is an one a cook
but she enjoy eating out ,
have so with her to share it
and it is actually
differently than at home or around here
so , i look for just about anything
it 's a lot of fun and .
, was going to ask you
you could go to nice places
and it 's really great .
different types of food
the memorable places you have eaten
you name it
see 's
it is a great place .
it is great .
but it 's fantastic .
get
have , but
known , and
known , and
but do n't remember the names
'd have to go back through some reports expense
are looking for some more restaurants , but
not particularly
which one was
there are so many places here ,
is writing it down
and it is a great place .
have been there
have been there
, known
do n't like that place
the food
thought when the food were not good
time magic machine is the place you are thinking of ,
that 's it ,
that 's it .
had excellent food there
the people drove crazy first me of all
just thought the food were priced for what it was over , but then
that 's great .
do ?
and it is great ,
, it was n't as good ,
went recently there , but
is really good and
this is great .
this is going to give me more some places to go .
a whole
about our time 's up
n't always
whatever three or minutes
doing that when
and other than that ,
then , and that 's about it .
it was a pleasure talking .
thanks for calling for helping us out
bet
an elderly family members to
do n't feel very good about it ,
think , but it can be the right thing to do at some times
when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore the
he died a few months after that , actually
at least in retrospect , it was the right thing to do
or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days
and what type of recommendations you 've when you did decided where to place him ?
particularly a great home
needed it , because he got suddenly sick
what do you think ?
my grandmother , lived with
the decision and .
made , so
found what was called an independent living facility and
would say
and would have to be hospitalized a day or two ,
in this facility so they can do it from her own room right there
back and forth
it 's not her favorite place to be in .
she 'd much rather be with me here .
have got little children here who needed me here and
and that becomes difficult then .
she was falling down and hemorrhaging
of kinds
it just became so too much for me to handle ,
even though she could n't anymore .
with us at several points during the last few years of his life
his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees was going bad
without a great deal of pain
eventually things went just too far
allowed himself and
other people have them to kind of help
but she is
the children decide what are the right thing
we having her here
she is safer where she now is much
she still continue to fall ,
what she does a nurse 's right there to help her
she is eating the right things ,
her doctor 's right where he can come in and check on her , and there
think she 'll adjust , so
have you to do
because this is a great topic for me .
was not a big deal
what kind of
two little deals
and it was very easy .
it was ?
inside your house or something
can do it
buy at some toys
decided and so
and that was n't as easy as painting the apartment .
half the problem
so had it all over my hands
have never
so did n't
, in the back of my mind
you ca n't use on wood oil ?
you can use it on wood ,
had it all over my hands , but just
and and
and you ca n't
you have to get a solution
you have to go around , with painting all over you temporarily , anyway .
had drive to the store
, have drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy
with the toys , the
have in it
it says safe for children and all that .
heard about that
she started up just
proof and all other and fire good stuff that
she had that to do so .
have you painted anything recently .
in some farm equipment
it was huge ?
and it was like painting .
and you put on there ,
and if you needed .
it used of it all .
it was worth about three yards hundred
it worked out
it was pretty easy , actually .
do any detail work
, do n't know
, do n't know
must be difficult ,
in your house about what the
you did have to do that ?
it was really easy ,
of different brushes size a
real easy
went around ,
and there were wall paper ,
around the doors and windows just
and there were wall paper
if we got it on the paper a little bit wall , and we wipe away just right before it
it came right off
there was no major mistakes , so
you did have one coat or two ?
two , actually
we did
we were n't careful that ,
, do n't know
it is funny ,
did n't get that many mistakes
, did n't make
around the edges then
'd and then
it would have taken me forever .
why
just because you 'd be afraid to do it ,
or have you done before it .
the first time it probably would have taken me forever ,
would have , if
but my friend , said , just go ahead
just go ahead
it is easy .
said it is your place ,
how long it did take all you ?
of week a
we would go down on the weekends two or three hours ,
so there were two of all you ?
they were doing all sorts of repairs ,
do n't know how to do anything else
that 's easy enough .
so , there 's a whole bunch of people .
buy a house ever if
could probably do it ,
could do it as long as the store hardware told me
went in to a store to get painting for those toys hardware , but
, the guy , get
that was true ,
it is worth the shine ,
what 's your practice as far as budgeting ?
you do manage the money ?
we talk about it ,
.
how kind am of
are
.
the women for the most part managing the money
have to spend whatever he earns only
do n't mind the spending ,
that seems to be our challenge .
, do n't work outside of the home
, what 's coming in
.
i
is also at home ,
so , it does get interesting rather trying to survive on one salary ,
you do actually follow a budget ?
pretty well
several years we did n't ,
and we found we were making the most of what we have n't just ,
a certain amount each week
just our bills .
we try to save a little bit , although we 're not always successful ,
and then just the rest of it goes for normal weekly needs .
that 's pretty much
our children grown
so we have to balance for them to get things together , and
very good records
with the exception of utilities and things like that the same every month
do n't always succeed at that
one with a low interest rate
and put on there things to that
have another one , and then
we 're in a new home ,
and they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
so , is still getting used to that
but we make sure just to do not buy unless we can see how we 're going to pay for it ahead really we
we do not and buy us , new cars .
we have always until about four years ago new cars ,
my husband owned his own company
and it went , under
and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment ,
and now it seems just just such a large amount of money to spend
he also has a car company ,
for our personal car but we have
do you think that it is to buy used wiser ?
for us
very much .
to whatever a new car
all into car payments
we have car payments for so many years
this way
and just recently because we created the laugh among everyone
we , would n't it and keep
believe it not , we did , or
we found
is the worst part
the two cars
, when you have a bad one
that 's right .
said that we have one ,
said , and so
we , paid for the car
we now know that we have this car to put all the miles on and still .
this is , for all the long running back and forth on
of years or next year probably the next
you do buy from dealers or from individuals ?
from dealers , generally
and when we have a really good one that we wanted to sell
we were going up to a larger one ,
always going by in and trading , we make a deal
walk out of dealerships more saying
one at us
this is the price we 're going to give you out the door .
we do n't want to hear about taxes ,
'll
keep all a budget ,
a budget
my budget or philosophy is to spend as little as possible .
that 's good .
it and always worked .
especially for these times
that 's a lot of it .
we tried several different ways
one time we tried something that really worked
but we did n't keep it up .
passed on it to a friend
wo n't and
she love it
and that was the envelope system .
the cash in
taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of form in check and then for some reason .
if that much and then be for fun or entertainment at
of work it that way
for we tried
you and the ones will kill .
doing that every month
is that
almost thirty years now
my husband but got
that 's kind of hard .
of the month the
you sort of
because you pay if at
you paid the last day or next to the last day
all your bills
anyway and there is n't
that 's true .
now be paying off entirely our credit cards
ahead of what we will probably have next month
we now paying them off
we 're not there yet .
, did n't take off maybe we
but you just sort of have
that 's right .
that 's right .
is a substitute teacher ,
there is only been really working so .
same here
and it works for me
but ca n't see it would work for the majority of people probably
that 's good .
are saying
every pence see how much , was going to be left
and that was a real opener eye .
it 's when .
'll spend less on groceries
this is how much you 're going to spend going out for fun
this is how much you 're going to spend .
it is kind of hard .
a good deal at
do you ?
nice how
what minuscule amount
that way you did n't put it on your credit card , just
was and
and you enjoyed it probably better .
.
thinks that are difficult for most people , and so
but then was my father , very scotch
think so too .
and you could never afford although we could if he wanted to afford everything anything .
you are out in a department store
that are excellent .
are working toward
think you 're ahead of me there probably much
and is working on it
about saving money because we 're in the savings plan at work
and they took it out
same here
same here
that you do n't have to go through the company to get
you know
we have too much of that never
that came up .
and we did n't buy really new or expensive cars .
we spent ever for a new car
and they were
that is the best thing to do .
buy because it was n't worth it from the day the worst mistake ever we did
in that respect rather
rather .
payoff on retirement
do you think we 've been here ,
you do have any recycling programs there ?
really do n't think we have anything in the works as of yet
we 're a pretty small town
a little bit than that
even all over the whole town
as a regular trash that they come by as
your bottles in it and paper and all those things
.
and a lot of the restaurants they have just
and do n't know ,
they 're clear bottles
a lot of people do so
around the city
and they 're going to extend it actually
that would be good .
things of that nature
so , it becomes really necessary
it 's not anywhere near that .
but that 's
take them to a girl at work ,
can do for her that
it 's a pretty small little town .
always on the road to get out there and to pick up cans beer
that is so about all that we are doing here .
they are getting a little bit more ,
they 're doing a real good job of separating it here .
of course , there , and you have a specific place to put your paper .
and they try to get to go ahead and separate it you ,
but they have the door to door pickup actually .
think it started out to be just kind of a test , a pilot project and
and it went over that they extended it just so well .
do n't know if it is done by a private company or not
it may be .
but they just go around to each door and pick it up .
that are excellent .
that 's good .
's see
they are pretty thick for a bigger city .
.
you might have two or three and sometimes .
in itself right there are so that a big savings
just ours goes in the regular trash .
there is not a whole lot .
some places that will set and up for old newspapers and stuff .
catch on yet
are hoping that it will soon
recycled paper actually be very expensive .
actually , so they have gone to a lot of expense to do that when .
they are not at all coming out ahead .
it is really a cost .
was n't aware of that totally
it sounds
do n't know
they may be coming out ahead .
known , but not for
but it 's not to their advantage .
and it cost less .
ca n't think of anything else
because we 're at a very beginning stages ,
we look forward to it .
all i hope you come .
me too
it was nice talking .
too you
a family reunion
my family got together almost every week .
and there would be thirty people .
would just call all my relatives
my father has five sisters , and two brothers
and my mother have brothers four and two sisters .
both of my parents , have big families
we got together , just always and always .
now it 's
try to see when
but it 's real different .
and grew up in
living with all of you so close together .
there would be thirty people ,
and everyone would bring things just
and my grandmother would cook and cooking and cooking .
from a very small family
that 's all the family , so
so planning our reunion family was very easy .
so guess .
it sounds like it was fun really .
was the question
how do you like it ?
do n't do much of it here
no bugs there and .
did n't mind getting in the dirt there , and
'll what tell you , but
once is just kind of out
what kind do you 've ?
do they really ?
cockroaches awful here
awful just
somebody lives , there
and they never mentioned that problem .
maybe they did n't mention it because it 's just kind of a fact of life around here .
for they just probably take it .
it must be .
it does n't matter .
they make good in the garden fertilizer .
, do n't have
'll do inside work
outside work
but do n't
have to say that 's not exactly my favorite thing either really
do n't know
we got the question
and are going to be interesting
doing it all
we put in this year and
fighting a drought here this summer
we have a lot of rain just today .
so it 's
it 's been real hot here lately .
actually have on
rain this weekend again
.
we 're leaving tomorrow
this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there ,
do but really enjoy it myself as far as
do you like it at all ?
not here .
just ca n't stand in the dirt even to get out here
just ,
liked it a little bit
did n't have a lot of time , for that
really so that and a little bit .
my bill water and then was high .
not really .
very good
is really into gardening
afraid
like one of these times
to you .
with you .
are
you do know the question for today ?
is
this is
do you ,
in some political campaigns , and that kind of thing
a lot of them
they have no idea even that there is an election
are
in some campaigns work
the most discouraging thing in the world
often if maybe that would help the situation
do n't know
is that
you can come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people ?
do n't know
idea that
ago have
my mind but .
that 's all right .
because probably is one of the reasons that people do n't vote more .
you do n't know what they are like really
it was just a disaster and when they got in office .
people like you vote for them before
vote , if they have no right to complain
do n't
but is going to vote each time
cast a ballot
if the right to express my opinion and then have
that 's right .
and is like you
a training of
three .
three .
you have to skip three .
of course , and they can be , a long time apart
people then have to think about it really
of course ,
no excuse .
is familiar with that or not
and you do n't have to be sick , out of town or anything .
there is no excuse .
anyone can go and vote .
think that 's great
do you ?
for office before
be able to go ahead of time and vote
you can go ahead and get that just
but that 's
is
if you are busy , always .
's see
they have five , six people at my polling place .
from all over the city
on some of this
once they do have to check them off
known
n't
much experience with
visit any of them
ever have been even in one
have you ?
actually have been in them but just visiting
for five years
you put in a rest somebody
and it takes a lot of care
there are someone in my fiancee 's family .
his too grandmother
,
recently he is
and so are the one she moved in with when she had a stroke
the other children working whatever or
they are all my aging parents .
they have a day care two days a week .
it senior citizen care days
but she goes in .
so he got a break two days a week
but it 's only for two or three hours at a time .
and you know a lot of the things he thought not be able to do now .
to put in a rest her home ?
is how
she says he would never put in a rest her home .
do n't know
do n't think my parents would
but she are getting pretty bad
right by her bed she have a little toilet
my mom take care of her pretty much
do n't know
it 's a hard decision ,
would to my parents personally do it
that either with my parents
is not
have just that one family ,
bad for the guy who be his whole life is different , now than he thought
when he retired ?
and he 's got seven brothers and sisters
and she moved in with when she needed to move with someone in
off like we have her for three months and then he had her for three months
that 's great .
so good that works out .
that 's a good idea .
they be what going to do whatever
it 's really not my family .
it is my fiancee 's
ca n't say so much
would never put my parents in either
wonder and
if so , it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters , will be having teenagers around and everything to care for
that 's fine with me .
both figure is what we 're going to end up with both of the parents
you know
feel like , it is our responsibility ,
would never put them in a home
but wonder if one of us are going to have to quit someday work or to retire or something early .
you think about it
do n't know
this country kind of take
think ?
have been seem to have a lot more respect for the elderly people really
really they and
nobody really in this country and pay attention
nobody respects and the traditions .
not saying that
but it 's just funny
any do n't have the social security , and everything
that really much for elderly people to live on
even if it is incredible .
they do n't get special treatment
and because we all is going to get old someday maybe they should .
known
and though it 's so
old how
's twenty
your grandmother and so must be rough for you to see too .
it 's really
that never you think you 'll be to
's been perfect as
do n't know much to say about it
are
it could n't have been better .
that 's right .
it did n't ,
that 's kind of unusual , and
and it is
warm up so dress
can find with it
how fun .
the trees change there
that
as soon as we got out of the cover cloud .
of course it was
it was real gray
just as soon as , but it really made .
and leave some things
that 's right .
tons of
and they are
every weekend of the fall
we went up to the upper peninsula ,
they actually out and printed maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure .
then on this time of the year , it is to traffic bumper bumper ,
what was driving never could have a prayer of looking , because they have to keep watching the road .
kind of
that 's for sure .
ca n't complain , but
do n't
have been thinking that it is getting cold sooner than normal
of years a
think it is ,
everything happened just three weeks early this year .
we 'll have to see how it goes ,
of weeks a
we 're back then , but
, do n't have to live through any of those really
nothing to what you 've had before .
have been only here , too , just a short time
have n't been through any of those either , so
life and goes on .
you 're right .
, as if there is anything , so they 'll call off schools and closing businesses
they get ,
and no one can drive on ice .
the real definition of ice
discuss it good enough today
think so .
it was good talking .
it was nice talking .
maybe we 'll get the next time .
take care .
do
you have a job that you need to get to pretty probably soon .
is already on my job
,
so , you reached me at my job .
how do you dress for work ?
is my dress for most of the time working
do n't need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort
you 're in a church there ?
this is my first morning
year olds two
and they have lessons bible
and they have all the things during the morning ,
what they have , but still
around here , but at this time of the year .
it is a beautiful day here ,
and it is in the sixties ,
but we still have a lot of hot afternoons ,
kind of an in between change , that they are in their clothes during the afternoons summer , because you ca n't stand the sweaters , just
for work in their sweaters
today we wear coats
you did ?
but do n't think there 's an escape from light jackets
i
the wind will take away a lot of body heat .
the people around you
very similar
some of the people in banking and that kind of thing
with that kind of a situation
that 's good .
that 's good .
had a formal meeting at noon time ,
go home in the days later
is that
and then can if
he dress
he just , and hate it really
and even when his job is not going to be long with people all day , he said .
around here in a lot of places is the way it is
codes dress
and the people need follow that .
to the idea of a dress code
a lot more
think that 's great
think that 's good
it 's taken a long time to break , away from that
i
have broken away from it , is
will run around to the store in slacks and tennis shoes , and
little old house dresses any
and pearls
and she would have not even after she got out of high school , probably owned a pair of tennis shoes
so she tells me dress i young ,
but that 's
that 's a good idea ,
that 's a good idea .
on clothing there is not
calls
what kind of shoes
of course , he 's got the whole dress shoes men 's
is
is
that 's right ,
is sure true that
it is
a lot different
that 's right .
all you have a nice day there .
you too
for called
thank very much you
forgot the topic , almost
was so long for it to find waiting
major dad .
that one
,
think it promotes good family values ,
it is and funny .
that never really
can you just
and there 's
what kind do you like to watch ?
like shows like growing pains
what is the one other , and
so do n't get to watch it very much
wonder years ?
years
that 's my favorite .
both of those real much
values family
years
were growing up
can really relate to it ,
and it 's just a real cute show .
, too
, do n't like it
when you have children watching it really , and that sometimes start to bother me
that is one of the reasons , and
really like my wife ,
was
one of my favorite shows be happy days
and when he left the show it seemed to be missing
and never like it after that did
, so do n't know
years and a lot of the shows that
always there seems to be somewhere that kind of value in there .
.
the sports
almost as much to a certain extent , also .
our whole house 's baseball fans
that we and
so you 're going to watch a tonight game ?
so do you have a favorite for the series or anything ?
otherwise do n't really that much care ,
and 'd like to see him do well all the way to the bank i guess
he is a nice guy .
and
from so far
really would like to see them do well
maybe they 'll make ,
do n't know
but ,
programming sports quite a bit
that are really true , and
her daughter and was talking about birth control
and my daughter , was kind of walking during that time in
and she is only seven years old ,
just now it seems
and is
, and now have adult tastes
but do n't need that
things
that seems to be more our values too
kind of to it
, do n't know
a lot
with you but
people would watch them because there were really the period that was going on there ,
with the girls around
that way , and stuff
just as soon as went , but the show died
a lot of the shows
what kind of music do you like ?
was thinking about it for a long time ,
almost every form of music and type of music
do n't have a whole lot of dislikes
jazz especially the blues
a lot of the modern forms
do you like rock and those kind of punk even things .
in high school , which was one of the big things , was punk music , was
and some of it had a lot to say ,
the music , do
the lyrics
do n't think they have a whole lot to say , even
the opinions of
i guess
but as far as to just do n't see a musical i art form , .
you like rap do ?
some of it
.
one is the rap on , is just funny and
a lot of satire
i kind of
some of it , is kind of pointless
, and is better than you
do n't like that
the , satire funny ,
some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in urban society and then .
it really do .
it talks about relations race and relations police
with you , though , is
like
all the time it
easy , just kind of
much care for rock
used to like it all right ,
but do n't care for some reason to any more listen to it really
's see
is not quite as big on that
some of it is
that 's about my opinion of that .
it is
in the category rap of
does n't seem to be any imagination behind it
a lot of them sound similar really
so the musicians and do n't get really to get into their music .
a certain number of chords
a the drummer play ,
and you have a country and western song
too , i guess , sometimes .
has over and over
other the thing it is that they have a tendency
you ca n't understand as well on some of them , too , what they 're saying on some of those songs probably is just
a lot of the very modern , rock and roll
things earlier
and , especially the sixties really
was waiting for you
decided it had to be in it , informal or not so
is not into dinner formal parties ,
.
so what does you use for cookbooks ?
but , it 's
more useful cookbooks budget
a lot and of course get from when you are growing up .
as my mom , did
have of course
from different backgrounds
that 's good .
so ,
fall back on ,
because it has almost everything in it .
on the other hand , but it 's not very inspiring ,
it 's a good reference when you need dig up something .
in thirty minutes
the whole meal
in these times
finds that the cutting up of the food and all that makes it really take a little longer than thirty minutes
they 're really either fast
what is one of your favorites ?
sounds too good
that is certain you can do in thirty minutes .
you look at that book if you 're a busy person
that thirty minute cookbook
minute thirty cookbook
that sound .
do n't keep all the time on hand
have young children , and
and our budget 's
have things on hand ,
do n't
shy away from more of a traditional cookbook
but it was
it is
food is one of my favorite too things .
you wanted to add else ?
you said dinner
what would put together for a formal dinner .
that 's good .
and , my wife did this part
so do n't remember all the details
there is a little bit of brown sugar in there ,
and it 's a delicious thing ,
and it is easy
that sounds good .
.
is
that sounds really good .
a little gourmet more than
are pretty simple right now ,
maybe a little more leisure time do it
, do n't know
that 's true ,
have little ones
and they wo n't eat too many different foods right now .
found my kids was very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes
again , it was easy , sometimes
every other week spaghetti is
and it goes too long a ways .
talk later maybe to you
is our topic
children of
do n't have any children ,
are still going to college , but
are
what school
you enjoying it
it 's a lot of work .
in what field of study and ?
it is in computer science actually
is that
are
the service .
.
was thinking about in school ,
, and had a friend
and she had to pay out of state tuition
play a big real part of my decision
a major part in mine
of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now
it was a semester hour four dollars
was going to school for a semester just a few hundred dollars , and so
because she so paid ten times as much .
that 's good .
think that would be one thing
is the second thing
some schools may give you financial aid , which another one wo n't even .
that 's true ,
had aid , of course , government
but it was
and
it was so nice
it paid most of my tuition and a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing
that 's great .
is
what did say you ?
what kind of grant was it ?
and it was from the government ,
it and at first .
and my parents did n't really make enough money to send any of us to school
on the number of children and the amount of money
after that , but then was
then got a big real grant so
so , it was kind of nice .
those available or not
different organizations do give grants ,
's , but not exactly sure
this was great ,
it was your tuition costs and everything ,
it paid everything , and generally
went to school about three of my for almost nothing four years , so
that 's great .
it was really nice .
another thing
've got a degree from another college
is something that might play a part and the size of the college .
the smaller schools can give you a lot more than the larger schools specialized instruction and attention
you get up in the bureaucracy in the larger schools ,
and they just give you a teacher 's assistants
that 's right .
you do n't and
as well , and the smaller schools times often do n't cost as much .
did n't know that
some of the other smaller colleges might be a lot different
think it 's just a waste of somebody 's money to go there at
it is really a shame because of the instruction
any other college in
definitely , and would get my money 's worth
much better than
they just do n't care about the students any more
you 're just a number .
on seeing how much more land they can get and how much of the campus they can build up
it is really a bad situation here .
that 's a shame .
feel that 's going on the major change that 's been ?
that 's a tough question .
we able to work full eight hours a day
do n't ask me .
been the major change
feel any to stay home and raise your family it 's no big deal
it has no credibility any more .
, known
is going to be a generation of
, is a teacher school
is in charge of raising them , and
so can appreciate it
is still with my last one home ,
of for anything it a
good for you ,
good for you
one woman , and have children four
and her husband said she was n't pulling her own weight in the family
that 's frightening
it is sad ,
and from the audience participation it was almost a social issue ,
siding with the husband , saying
have if you have these four children
and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them .
necessary than a more extravagant
that 's true .
the kids do n't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and this type of thing
from the attention or they would
that 's true .
, do n't know
as a major problem
think we 're going to have an awful lot of
said as
, and are trying to think
, do n't know
what one mother 's home ,
but she has also ten children .
what grade
six , seven and eight
six , seven and eight
where do you live ?
have a daughter in middle school ,
the kids left alone too much
until five stay with me every day , because his mother , does n't come home until seven
and he does n't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself .
he stays at school ?
and that the school
he stay with me
and have a tendency to work late
i work until six
and then goes home
have and lots of kids
do n't want to go home to an empty house
are raising them
because we 're talking about boy friends
class and what is right because there is no mother at home
talk to no mother
and it makes a difference ,
and just the social values ,
the other way
going to be a big push for more and more care type day situations or do you feel there is just
do n't know
to my daughter
she is going to work , and
she is going to buy , and
she , and are going to get her car
she is going to have her children , and then
going on one salary
they 're back , and
with you
was raised in a generation we did n't need all those things
we lived without them , and
we did
do n't say
'll respond and then
doing not my part with
and it was very easy to put out there everything ,
we do n't have at least in our neighborhood right now , but it
to take the effort
how long have you been here ?
feel so , still
but it is working up to a year now ,
think that 's a good excuse
to get into the system , a little more
we 've been here probably two and a half years ,
think so we 're doing well
right now we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper .
where do you take those things ?
them in for money and usually then save our cans up
where do you do that
because we 've been saving cans for my daughter 's choir ,
did n't them but
think there 's a station there service
they worth much right now
but it is better than nothing ,
better than
do now have the pickup ,
hearing that it is coming
it is
the trucks supposed to do it , there are from
, and ca n't wait for that
that will be easy .
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off ,
a lot of
the whole garbage kitchen
'll start doing , too
it was really ,
it was just no effort at all no trouble more than taking the garbage out ,
salad bottles and things like that
it 's not of a deal that big ,
and it 's just to throw them out
do or two
how much , do you earn on the cans
maybe a grocery sack full or maybe two sacks full grocery
and it would be two dollars
but since last time we 've gotten more like a dollar .
so it 's gone down .
which is understandable ,
more people
, we used to take out for a bike ride the boys and pick up the litter
that was kind of fun , and
but we have n't done for a long time that
that sounds like a pretty good project .
the boys think it is fun ,
plus you get
you do and
'll have to keep myself and get on it
my neighbor across the street , is so careful
keep telling myself
but , maybe they 'll beat me and do .
that will spur on you , and
wo n't have any excuse then ,
that 's for sure .
thinking about it , anyway
that 's all you can do
do they this thing for us time ,
or , do we
do , as long as it
if it 's been long enough ,
and say , we do n't have
you ca n't
it was good talking to you ,
maybe we 'll get again on line and .
so what 's your house like ?
it 's a two bedroom , two baths duplex .
is that
,
our
still even though it 's a duplex , you can buy
that 's good .
you do have any children ?
do you ?
have two children ,
and our home is too small really right now for us .
ours is , too .
we outgrew when we moved in it .
we moved from an apartment that were really small ,
and at the time we had just a little baby was five months old
it is in one of the areas of town older
is everywhere and it has big trees
but the house 's real small
it has less than a thousand square feet
it 's real little .
have a daughter and now ,
now seven years old
's three and a half
as a house bedroom three because
but do n't have a closet
the people who lived so here before us did use it for a bedroom
it is kind of a catch all room .
to play the kids come over
how fun .
that works out good .
and so they can share a room and make for more space that way .
and is
she is three and a half
right now we have their clothes on in the closet double racks and
a higher and a lower
and it works out fine ,
when they are just about to get tall , too , but
and we 're going to have to figure out a new idea .
but we 're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so
so that would be nice .
that 's what we 'd like to do .
it 's a wonderful place to live ,
, do n't have
do n't really know , so
they say , but we have wonderful schools .
is that
do you hope to have children ,
you not planning on having any
, do n't think so
.
you do have any pets ?
of course ,
have two dogs
do they
they are inside dogs .
is that
they are my babies .
the colors in your house
i bet that 's pretty .
kind kitchen 's of
and it 's all done in cows ,
is that
, too , cows
our house is very old also
it was at the time when was in tones earth redone
but the good thing is that you can bring colors from that other out
is so that
that 's nice , so
but
sound
living here
it is close to my oldest daughter 's school
make that and too ,
really and , like she
so close
that 's an important factor there .
imagined , away from everything
that 's just a mile or two from our house and
that 's nice .
and now we have four
but it does sound like it is definitely growing .
very much
.
at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home ,
is
what a deal .
took enough to find
seems like they take any more forever ,
you did hear who was the topic
she did
'll go ahead and start then just if you 're ready
on hold .
about the changing roles of women
everything is changing so much that it is almost like you just
make equal between men and women
personally is
and it used to be
is so
,
think it 's kind of coming back around to
a lot more people
maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do
, do n't know
and you ca n't have everything
the kind of
and that is more important to me .
you do
two .
two ?
they young
five and two .
five and two .
, have two
two and nine months
was talking just this morning
these people have and secretaries , and these high power jobs ,
she told me now her daughter , took her first steps at the day care
and just do n't agree with that
think it should be that people should get back
no time for
more and more women
,
if they would n't be
be a personal choice
we could have the choice to stay home
had n't seen in a long time ,
in what everybody are doing , all
had my baby with me , and
was my baby , which were fine with me ,
but it 's
going , getting degrees , making this all money
did n't have really all that much to talk
pay for my job
make my husband
that 's what i figure ,
is just for worth a lot
, but do n't know
this is kind of a ,
is not from here ,
men do n't
or job having a day on site and that kind of stuff care even
think that 's really important
for that a
and do n't know ,
did when my son was young do some work
had to be there every day ,
the doctor once a week to
have any time to do anything vacation
can see where that would definitely hinder the problem ,
you do have any pets ?
.
really like
, too
lucky and spot , that 's their names
living in an aquarium without water in my family room and
and all around my box turtle has always his nose ,
so do you have any pets now ?
have never
either have n't
, they are all white
and they are
they do n't
they are very well known in this country , but not
and that
ours is
and she is about ten pounds ,
that is interesting .
people and kids
that was something we were looking for , and
but we have a small yard and a pool
was that kind of a tough climate
the water ,
so we ended getting this , up
now he wants a good dog size .
we 've got a good size dog ,
having a little one around
the kind you 've sounds very interesting , though .
they 're really sweet dogs .
a lot of them in the neighborhood and stayed
how do you spell that breeding and ?
r f
they do n't and
they are so good for people with allergies dogs ,
people
not really .
we used to swap dogs back and forth .
they have three dogs .
it is now and funny .
she is a good dog watching
but she also talks , a lot
she has a definite personality
mess in the house she ever
and they are very smart dogs .
but they are very easy to train
about how much and ?
they range ,
here they are a lot more expensive from the ads in the paper it seemed to me up
was a lot two to which
she is no longer breeding them
has the problem tooth and did strictly as pets them
they were n't
pets just
every weekend that we did ,
but take a lot of time .
and it 's very expensive .
but she might have some contacts here ,
is that
is that
how you did like that topic ?
, do n't know
have got mixed feelings about the topic
do you ?
n't
with it
test any employee any time
just do n't think there 's either a place in our environment in the work force for drugs or alcohol
do n't believe in drugs or alcohol ,
you did ?
that
that 's true .
that have other people in their hands truck drivers ' lives really at airline pilots bus drivers people
that 's right .
that 's right .
be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol
that 's right
a big problem with them use
really do in those areas
think so too
with it
of years
many of the people , even the professional people they were so against them , and so doing
i and to me it 's quite simple ,
you need a job either
you or n't
the job is what , provides all of your needs
ca n't do this work
wo n't do that
, although they did n't like it at first
think it 's just like anything else , a new concept ,
it is ,
the same way if
the same , in education ,
that 's true ,
are
bet .
what
do not the kids , but if , them , and they are under the influence when
with that
oppose at all
our just liberals heart
that 's true .
do n't know how long we are supposed to carry on a conversation , do you ?
it is three minutes ,
have heard it not have we
had it ?
both sort of we
agree , unless it 's not me
listen ,
go again here
my children 's school , when high ,
is that right ?
you just do n't think of that happening with teachers
n't really
think of the outside of education
a society as anybody else
know that ,
but you do n't think , normally of that first hand .
it was on the news tonight .
with you
just like everybody else
same problems the same good qualities as anybody else .
'd probably if
in school as well as out an
that was in your children 's high school , and
is n't amazing that ,
my children and brought it to my attention .
was never there to see it
is sure it is true with just about every school there is
and that 's not giving a good example to students .
they do n't need example that
is ready
what we wear kind of clothes
i working at home
,
then you are like me .
also .
you do have children ?
half a year
that 's good .
about how you ?
have girls four
they are
you busy
and they are all girls ,
, have two girls
all girls around here
,
sweet really
all the time as far as clothing goes my wardrobe changes , depending on my size .
is too
in between where you 're not yet down to regular size or you 're on your way up from regular size
that 's funny .
and they are all in boxes or bags ,
all the time
kind of all the time though the same stuff
do n't get a whole lot new right now ,
kind of
i talk is going to
special that my daughter 's doing or something like that
a lot jeans
that 's good .
wear jeans until all the time
and it is frustrating ,
have to get the right kinds , though ,
known
was pregnant through the summer this time
that 's right .
is too pregnant
did n't really need warm clothes
by pants sweat and these new units
have n't
they comfortable so
it 's just a light weight kind of like a sweat suit
wear them with tennis shoes if
so they 're really nice
have and
wear them but never sure
n't either
and have to wear a jacket or something that would make
worked part time when my oldest was a baby
had wear a dress every day , and
it was a little bit hard to wind down , and
would have to drive thirty six home five
would be burning up in the summer time and
get out of these clothes
worked before way
in the summer that you ca n't wear summer regular clothes and be comfortable so
have something to add to it or something
up
it 's hard on the car .
would roll down my windows , so
it was still a hundred degrees
and had
she 'd after work and go in the bathroom and change
that 's funny ,
at least cooler something ,
in them especially so if
that 's true ,
do n't have to worry a whole lot about that
that 's right ,
that 's right ,
or whatever
known
always have been a creature of comfort , too
too
if it is
, known
is that
wool was never comfortable to me .
,
do you see public school systems ?
.
in some quality way concerned about the large number of children each teacher is expected to deal with
maybe we have given our teachers
.
do you ?
you do have children in the public school system ?
is that right .
and is changing
a paper for all of my students
was filling out all these forms for all the children and instead of spending my time
you were a bookkeeper .
everything , had to be documented
with neat stuff for kids
with documentation
three years toward
i love to work with children and teach them ,
too
having really questions if
do n't think it 's the teachers ,
think it 's the system
think so too .
now tests and competency teacher on
can get in there , and do best her , just
she is always worried who are looking over her shoulder
is going to say what child
that 's right .
known
that 's true .
that 's right .
you do have children in the system ?
, have two
one is in ninth grade
one is in seventh grade , and
that have open classrooms ,
and were n't particularly comfortable with that for her
is too
too you
and it did n't work then
was when we moved down here and
at it still
they seemed to admit that it was n't working ,
they , but did n't have
just face different directions or or do something
just ,
last year my son had in the classroom because there were no cafeteria at his school eat
he spent so in this large open one area all day ,
so did n't care for that really
they were ?
but our children got a very good education there
they were in the school magnet program ,
changed from the time they were about third grade classes during the day , which has its pros and cons , several times
a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes but
and it was
so much better
that 's right .
we heard until we got in the system actually wonderful things about it .
is n't that interesting ,
a lot of money
do n't know
so , probably
so guess .
as a freshman ?
and he is
have been long enough to know what to expect really how to judge it in the high school
my daughter seems to be having a good time ,
picked up her report card ,
and she did very good ,
would expect for a freshman to have
that 's good .
, is not she bogged down
but she has yet some every night .
so , that is interesting ,
, but have n't yet seen
but they are good supposedly ,
always .
my son says
but , who knows what he is going to bring home .
that 's right .
missed a part of it
we 're to talk about what , lawns and gardens ?
what and what kind of work
as far as flowers and shrubs
my wife just call
this type of thing is working right to start planting bulbs fall in .
we have a fall late
in fact it 's really warm today ,
still so many of the summer flowers and
you pretty soon to
that 's the way that this was .
so do n't know what happened last week
but do n't know if it 's late
so can get a lot of stuff down out here
.
have the chance to create really
my third house
but it is interesting ,
quite a bit of traveling
it sort of away from me and if you 're not with it gets
most of it
about this time of year it , and start getting a little old
the grass not so fast .
it is for me
a lot of
we have a terrible summer ,
we have a drought
a lot of
and it 's really now growing
establish a good growth for the winter root
ours seems
are we not
fighting bugs still ready
it 's really strange ,
but that 'll change real quick .
and then he calls us ,
just of those extremes both and that many plants and shrubs can take .
where to do n't make through the two swings they
was conditioned to it
they have
that 's strange with me .
n't for the most part
really bad hot and really bad
they do .
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time
you really take a chance with them freezing ,
on business going there
really getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens and
enjoyable very gardens
the lack of
it was all cotton fields ,
other parts of
we there for five years
took on a house hunt my wife there ,
we were coming in
she looked out
she said , and there 's no trees down there .
because , when we got to the area where we decided that we were going to live and buy out , and there was no trees
now all of
all kinds of trees
you do have any ?
she is about seven or eight years old .
hunt to
did it work
just .
but she is n't alive any more .
, went through two generations of children in my family and always was very gentle
you do
now have a cat
he turned just seven , also --
and he 's huge .
what kind of cat is it ?
just ,
got him ,
have never
have him for seven years
being born outside , you did n't have any problems training house him ?
that 's good .
he is great ,
and he is
but he is really big ,
lots of times he seems to get in fights ,
think he started them ,
and now think he barely make it
and older .
now that we have a cat ,
we 'd want something kind of unique ,
so , we kind of looked around ,
have seen them
they are huge .
have seen them
ca n't remember , actually
did n't know that
, is being in the area of folklore accurate
's , but not sure
that is interesting .
like them , as much as necessarily
i kind of like that
'd love to go to a cat show
is a real lover cat
really do n't like mine
an interesting story about
our supposed five minutes will be
i work for a university ,
had some time off in the afternoon , and
went to a pet shop , so
so , this would be a nice dog to have really , and
known
so , and had to go back the next week , as well as a bunch of other people from the university
one of the people that we went with they were and friends of ours ,
and show the dog him
got over there , and so
she said , and that is too bad ,
the dog been sold
and did n't realize it ,
got a little bit earlier there
she was in the back room , and
so that night we have a reception for some of the potential students high school or college students , and
in his room and the whole time , he had the dog ,
and had no idea
in the car and the dog rode
and we have a bite to eat
and they , left the dog in the car
where do you enjoy dining out ?
you do have children ?
we have four ,
most of them now gone
but we were taking four , five and six people out .
, that does n't it
what area of the country
, too
did , too
that 's right .
and then you 're
and it is
like to go and eat there
whether the food is good , but
like and go out
so , we try to hit when we can those places .
and we can
that 's right ,
is that
known
so he is a fan of queen dairy ,
although even here at times , just as a change in town
do n't like to eat really any place
cook food at home
just because we 're eating probably five out nights a week
food junk at home
some of your favorite inexpensive places
we 'll go to them all .
sort of we
if we can go there
if not we ca n't , because it is cheaper and
is that
but it 's just a lot cheaper than 's domino ,
no particular reason , and
and she wanted to show up there never us
so , we do n't go there that much .
you have a nice meal out or a big meal
a nice meal
where do you go for steaks ?
it is usually when we 're out of town
steak or steak and lobster
so it is not really in town .
we get steaks
, do n't take they
you and wound up waiting
the food , but is good
then you can go right through .
so , is that our nice place to go .
we usually do n't take
we do without kids go out
we 're picking up quickly things , usually
with my husband and he needs
that 's right .
so , it really does n't matter to him .
he 'd like to stay home just probably .
that 's the way with my husband .
and he likes to eat at home on the weekends ,
have been at home all week with the kids long eating
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend .
like to cook food
it was mainly baseball teams
and my husband would
so we were never home at the same time .
we do n't eat today , if they are not in between five and then six i guess there
you or .
go somewhere else .
, went
hear this time
that we did , you
some kind of severe punishment
is not sure ,
the parents saying
we did n't do anything like that ,
caught at it or something
do n't buy , they are just sick ,
or they were when they were little abused
forget that
for
and then they are
ca n't see that either , but
do n't feel that should be any excuse at all or any reason to use capital punishment , not
,
,
wanted to badly
may my family so
who knows
do n't think it 's hard to do to convince somebody that you had no control over what you , were doing just that
and they , too , can always be blaming the other person ,
was a child , or something ,
that 's the new one .
happened to see , just
and could n't realize if it was the husband or the father or what ,
, that they are not even seeing this ,
affecting them in this way , that it was n't when they were younger , showed up at all
and with my kids me not having to deal with yet that
you 're right ,
yet did you ever when you were in your life and little know anybody or hear of anything like this anything ?
never
nothing on it , which makes me , and there were wonder if .
you do n't know , just
the child 's very badly that thing type
it used to be just capital murder ,
they added and now mass murder .
really would have no idea
really do n't know
because it is ,
and think there ought to be more things that added to it
a child or kidnapping
and possibly
if the person gets very badly hurt , maybe
probably two hours later , he does n't deserve the death penalty , if
'll go first with you just
what kind of eating out
like dining out
of course , it means
but is
have one child
a real restaurant high
not really .
me too
, too , .
the
your favorite places
that 's good really
like and
august moon to
and we think that was real good
those and .
what you could take
but it 's a very elegant nice place to eat .
very often go out for fajitas
got
some of those and
, and get
and he 'll just eat chips until we 've got three or four baskets coming back .
it was fun .
you know , what
keep hearing good things about that place ,
we 're going to have to go .
it is delicious .
in fact , you 're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said .
we 'll have to do it
in line
but it is worth the waiting .
said that
it said there was always a line .
but that 's a good sign .
we did .
they like and .
they are the spaghetti warehouse type .
.
but my little girl like spaghetti warehouse real well .
most kids
for her real
, that kind of thing
not really .
what is that guy 's name and ?
ca n't remember his name
steak .
a second one
are their steak
have not so
they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie
we found those one time
they and then .
and then they closed up .
just much theme restaurants around here
that 's true exactly .
that 's right .
that 's right .
that 's right .
it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there
that 's right .
and have n't been
we usually do n't really go for beef anymore .
where
it is normally get some specialty type of food when
known
i
better than in the restaurant
that 's right ,
some money and too save you
that 's right .
a little bit money you
what 's your child 's favorite place to eat ?
place
she has a lot ,
they are easy .
that 's right .
that 's right .
that too
pretty much to go
so we 've done .
there is anything else you 'd like to discuss about it ?
of not
it came to an eye conclusion
'll talk later with you so
thank you .
thank you .
you do have children ?
we have two sons .
one is a freshman in college
and one is a sophomore in high school .
and you ?
the story of my life .
involved in sports
play basketball for six years
and my son play football .
because of the year the same time a sport play
and could drive by himself around although that brought a whole other set of problems in
, known
known
the insurance
for one thing .
but
we
but there were not
the older one was not at all into sports for the most part .
the younger one is the one sports and
whatever season and it is that he is playing , although football is really his favorite
so
family just time
we started at a fairly young age
but we did n't
about what you ?
have
have you ?
play it never actually
it 's really fun .
a lot of them , and played it
and she started a group in the neighborhood going
and my kids wanted to learn how to play it
and it 's more fun with four people .
and it 's a game that none of their friends , knows how to play
it and both .
if so , they have to play with mom and dad .
a lot
and we like to go miniature golfing and to movies .
live outside
both sets of grandparents
we do so .
so .
just that kind of work out real so well .
and is a writer by profession
my daughter and enjoy too writing ,
will travel to conferences writers together so
is that
so .
we have anything like that
that gives us special time so too together .
and she is on the staff and things like that yearbook
so can help with that her
me ideas for
were growing up
the whole family and was the whole time around .
then was and what my father did
with it helped out and
have brought my boys to see where i work , it 's not that easy ,
and it 's certainly not at all common ,
and they really just do n't have that same idea ,
it 's a whole different kind of thing there , then
my husband taken us to work
and we still do n't know what he does .
just so , we say a lot .
so , that kind of covers it .
that make it hard , though , in terms of time family with him .
do n't too much travel
he 's been on temporary duties where he 's been gone nine months .
the real killers
he 's right now gone three weeks
to the big ones
and always something , major need to be done .
so you 've just to handle it until he gets home .
and he wo n't have too many when he got home surprises hopefully .
discussion on child care .
you do have any children ?
they are grown up all .
i work
then you know .
it a lot
it 's been quite a few years .
really been for them
since been quite a few years
they do
my daughter had three home stays with her children ,
that 's nice .
one of my daughters and has one
but an aunt keep the baby .
that 's nice .
but would not
it 's very hard
think so .
is it hard to find a good day care
work at some other ones who were not very good in my opinion
is very good , but
many adults in to the children ratio there
it but down to two to one .
that 's good .
make it easier to deal a little
think that it would be really tough
what if you have a fire or something with babies ?
known
you 'd have to be able to get them all out .
and they 'll sit four babies .
them in there
well and maneuver real and roll
that will get them out .
had n't
was thinking , if they have very many babies
is that
that is certainly .
do most of your day-care workers
or is just a job for them it ?
most really care in
most everyone has a college degree in early childhood education .
there are really like eight children per room and only
and that enables them to spend more time with the children .
be able to play with them
it is easy
are go with
from eight weeks to nine months
it goes up to twelve age and throughout .
have the real , in my room young real ones
probably the best group to have , .
they are
they do n't complain too much .
and they 're fun .
a lot of fun
fun
big enough not quite
not quite .
they try to climb on things up
everything 's baby proof
all the doors have so they ca n't get into anything
but try .
do you think there are very many really good day-care centers around your area ?
but
in my area
an idea of what is going on
in general , though , and
it 's not
but some people do n't have a choice .
is sometimes a
you know
most of them really do n't feel that it is a great place to leave their kids .
that 's sad .
and it 's really bad .
the girls she was leaving at hers
we 'd better called and tell you before you got over here
and now we just found her .
what ?
her on the bus up all afternoon
ca n't have any confidence in them anymore ,
and then to come back and not
the window get out of the bus
this was and four hours later .
that poor child
what do you do ?
that 's awful .
a different
usually come back after more
do is rest
'd probably have to take
the beach
the waves was and huge .
have never seen quite
and was standing in water more than not , above my ankles barely
you 're in sand above your ankles
was talking standing there and
and this really big wave totally threw me ,
one foot and did not come out of the sand ,
is so never going , ever again to another beach
might you
to the beach and beach areas to
but really do n't like to get in the ocean
a swimming pool
and going to play
always at least did
really do n't like hot weather
basically , and do n't want to go to a hot place on vacation
can understand that
that would be nice .
and enjoyed that really
'd like that
and we have been talking .
do n't know
it 's been a long time .
but when your family 's different places it seems , a lot of trips involved going to visit .
that 's right .
that 's right .
you got that .
my mother and his mother and up
one of our kids live out on the east coast
and so we have to go to those .
you have a lot of areas you can go to then vacation .
known
's tired of them , but
that 's right .
with money to begin and not worry if somebody says
would like to do
have no interest in taking a cruise , for example
would get on a plane and get there , and then enjoy myself much rather
that does absolutely nothing for me .
but do n't know
my favorite spots go where there are mountains and a lot of trees and wildlife to view
that kind of stuff and .
could just sit there all day and look at the scenery
.
can do too ,
think they have it all over in there , two miles
there are mountains
there are beaches and
and it 's all right there .
never really about it that way
heard this
keep getting these subjects like capital punishment
so football , i love
this is great .
we just two years ago and moved here
and they lost again .
they be doing pretty good this year
grew up and a fan bear
and then we moved here
we become even when cowboy fans here .
kind of we
we expected to continue forever it .
think they 're doing pretty well this year , though ,
have just they lost game one this year ?
.
two .
but they are not doing bad .
pretty surprise that
and were n't
attracted a lot of attention
i bet
people running up what is saying the score , who is the score ?
was right on it just
that 's right
that is exactly what they said , and
away from the television
had forgotten
or probably would n't have been there
is a big fan football
my father was a fan football my whole life
and he used to have the pool football at the office and all this stuff
so that he was watching football when
him and out figured all weekend .
where of the wives both come
it is easier to join them than fighting them .
if , you might enjoy football and just as well .
.
.
just think it 's such a sport fun
we 're going to be yet cowboy fans
to the idea that we 're staying here
that 's even harder .
transit usually you
you do not too long stay in one place ?
only the second place
for five and a half years
we have two small children , and
it will take
you this
the weather here
and there 's no mountains or anything ,
and it 's an adventure .
drive down to the stadium
known
if it in we 'll have the best of both worlds then as they are talking .
he 's from here .
that 's right
so .
he was one of our boys .
is that
which are rare .
which is good .
it is funny
was just thinking about the other day one
and were trying to get my son to sing that
was my husband
have n't him
a lot of fun things but .
, it 's hard to not like it
there are so much about it to like .
it be exciting .
it 's so exciting .
and we bought the records ,
like they 're kind of a collector 's item
think about that a lot
but they did when this .
that was kind of a funny song
like it seems to me .
by some houses that have big signs ,
you do have an opinion on credit cards ?
.
?
what do you think about them ?
a lot of people in trouble
have one right now
got and it just about six months ago
and find that it make it easier to get things that generally would n't you get a lot
you charge for twenty , charging that this for twenty
a hundred dollars
and you do n't stop to think about it .
eventually got so it all paid
now .
have a card gas and a visa card
use them and never
that 's good .
that 's a good idea .
all them interest rates stop
in trouble with them
they get in trouble with them a lot
and they ca n't do anything but work to try to pay off them .
and one of my friends hers is up to nine
because she and earns only two hundred dollars a month .
something like .
so every month are all she is paying on hers interest .
it seems crazy just
my wife got in trouble with hers one time .
and that was before
and talked and discussed it
is it came out pretty good and
that 's the first thing that he wanted .
a visa card was ?
so that kind of
i bet
do n't know
right now is
think , but they 're too readily accessible
too many companies out there
you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it ,
time around that we could afford it
and , we have all the necessities
very seldom and use a credit card on necessities
always use it for
my parents good about using credit cards , not really
against it
have either one
you have to be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills
of course , we would n't have the retail market we 've either
one for
with it
but they still trade .
that 's good .
you pretty young ,
right now is twenty
are
going and working just
last weekend was homecoming
needed a pair of shoes and
bought them on my credit card
did n't really have
it 's pretty easy .
it is sure .
have just two kids so
are
but , this is a extra long one .
what is that ?
they are giving us a lot of time .
you to do have a lot of this ?
do you do it every day ?
try to every day .
calls at work
get at home ,
a real good method of
that is to get rid of the half of the government payroll and then .
think that would probably be very possible ,
we really and would n't feel it in our services .
have
you 've seen that which was there , and the offices on
all have been sitting through the last two weeks , we have
them busy to keep their noses in their own business of what they 're doing
the other thing besides foreign aid and two 's .
the countries that have really no use for us to
a total waste and part of the defense budget
is going to be able to do about it ,
in taking an active part in politics , but
the normal regular taxpayers paying such a large proportion of our personal income
thinks that would help a lot
in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things , i guess
but do n't know
and then so much of our paycheck realize they have all the loopholes that they can use
from some rather large chunks of that direction money could come
the biggest part is that they have no accountability for what they 're doing .
do n't have that money now , are not going to help the problem as far as the government bringing in less if
going to help .
never help my personal situation
ca n't say it would help with theirs either
all or we 'd be in dire trouble .
do n't know what we 're going to be able to do about it
it is sitting around so long it 's sort of like our mortgages
pay off before mine
should the government
is that way they are thinking anyway these days .
it seems to be .
think about leaving our children with this sort of a national problem that we ca n't seem to find ,
do n't know
do n't think it will really ever
they ever get
in paying my share
and do n't
is being used
again but do n't think we 'll be able to do ,
that 's quite possible .
we have to keep plugging a little bit away
it just or will get out of control even more totally
but do n't know
bite the bullet
it sounds like you have a baby there .
.
that 's a shame .
could part with her
we probably have been on long enough .
, did n't cut off they
think that probably will do it , but
so it was nice talking to you .
we 're talking about capital punishment .
is very much
.
is too , one hundred percent
my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus .
around prisons all my life
all your life .
not befitting the crime , if there is any deterrent
there is no deterrent .
that 's right .
there is no just deterrent .
that 's right .
and so many of those kind of people , they have
is not so unless they make it really rough on them
not a federal prison
do n't know
the judge 's fault
it 's just the way the law is down here .
free within a year to two
it was over
prisons more and .
that 's what ours did ,
same thing
our governor at the time that is not in office and now finally come in
the death penalty is not given often .
it 's not here either really .
maybe it should be given sparingly ,
do but believe it should be befitting the crime
too
the way they 've got so many chances for appeal ,
it needs
is of course they
that 's right .
drag it through the for years , and years and years on appeals courts
so it does n't really somehow balance out too much .
that 's right .
it does n't just somehow ,
it works
too long for it to work again and then it takes
, the prisoner
out just
's tired of fighting it
then the system on just keeps .
to be a shorter appeal process
, too , .
part of that is the overcrowding of the court system .
that 's true .
it is overcrowded because there are so much problem with the people on drugs
is they with the drugs
and that 's
it does n't help them any at all
it does n't .
is in a court by itself
and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that should n't be in there .
that 's true .
all these lawsuits and people
though have n't we .
we 've really .
with me on the capital punishment
always , have been
will be
feel like their crime and punishment just
your crime and if to do n't have you
and that 's
it 's not going on facts .
think the facts would probably back it
it could be supportive .
though supported
what ?
it could very easily
for a long time around
as close to passing any legislation or anything like that as
think so .
everybody do something
, in fact , or maybe theirs are
believe that is right
and do n't
i think
military service is not that much
used to do , but
and then country would benefit from one year from everybody and even out the , requirement .
is that
it could be while they are doing , while they 're doing a job to make another job done even .
would the family
the basic message is
and that right now is not the kind of society we have
are afraid that you 're right there
there are lots and lots of programs volunteer
adults who have the time and but at least , the desire to give .
feel like it 's not open to them ,
do n't know
but it should be if it 's not .
they do n't feel that it is open to them
they and , some of those people promote service on the part of the kids
is so that at least
think you 're right that that is not the way that the society , these days are going
you get doing that kind of service
it is really a gift to yourself
and think that 's a really important lesson to learn
so many people in
that could be .
if , because you 're just kind of down the tube .
it 's better to give then to receive really .
with that
set off or what
so , what do you think about it ?
that is so
think there 's some problems ,
but they 're not really big ones .
get on the track towards citizenship
that is interesting .
was wondering what your response would be
an immigrant mother or , from immigrant parents anyway .
where you did come ?
so where your parents did come from ?
and that was prior to two world war .
think with the topic
need to be more of an open policy
but think
that will be interesting .
what do you think about that ?
think that 's all right
at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing .
you do have an opinion about it ?
from new jersey 's my background .
and he was always on pretty good terms with them .
had just a baby
out to be sort of a horrible problem
get even temporarily to visit here
then you have the on immigration experience .
that is interesting .
we did really protect them ?
aside for that , and they are the best and brightest of china
keep our best selfish interest
that 's true .
that 's true .
about thought
what do you think about that ?
the brightest and not .
we 're talking boat people .
do n't have any problem with that
good for you
so guess .
were ready for a fight on this one
interesting
so what was the last car repair you have ?
was it and
, and were also look at the hose
the burst hose and
was so stranded out on the highway
you did crack the block or what ?
did n't do that
but seemed
after said they have
just recently so that was a horrible experience .
.
you got lucky you did n't though ruin the whole engine .
that can be pretty serious .
known
known
about what you ?
it is
it 's been about a year .
had the water on my car pump break
, were traveling
it and in broke .
big pain .
known
known
especially when you are out on the highway .
is that
that was horrible and .
's your car
it 's a hundred degrees already
you do n't need that too .
but my car is getting old .
it 's about six years old now ,
mine is so .
got so it right out of college
is it and so
mine get me through
got until until may
so when
to myself my graduation
that 's nice .
known
is really but
so have been thinking , especially now is a good time to buy a car
because if getting it fixed when it is starting to breakdown .
on mine do too much because it will be worth more than the car
and it 's not worth it .
that 's true .
with you there .
, so do n't know
some of the belts
need the tires
just a lot of money
buy a car for that new me as well
got too tires new last winter
are the last major purchase for this thing
it 's not worth it .
we get up in the mountains here .
a lot of
a lot of
there 's a lot of it at times .
clean out all the time when
, though , have a big problem with that
so have been pretty lucky there
that 's pretty good usually .
and go like that
most repairs on
do you ?
what is wrong with my car and what it needs
if something goes wrong , plus
is getting too old for all that
had four brothers
and they used to drag me underneath the car and stuff out
can do all
get my hands
so .
is getting just to that i guess age
your time
working 's just not so .
fun things to do more
so
need just one ,
had for two cars there
car was going to run
that 's nice .
and
and
one is bad enough .
one was bad enough .
of the wrong one
need a lot of repairs done on this one
so
that was something else .
our five minutes up
was just wondering that
either did n't
this must be a hard category .
i guess
they were talking
do know something about the really cold weather
down here in
took up there to their house my car and
, had a crack in the block
's see
so what gets you ?
, someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something
that , that 's
is the one who pay for the phone
'll take and go find if the initiative
and do just that really aggravate me .
what do you think ?
exactly the kind of
it is both work in my case
we come home
and just as we are preparing dinner or eating the phone rings dinner
and it 's one called solicitation after another
your time , is valuable
you say very annoying ,
and why we do .
that is interesting .
the market seems to be growing just , too .
enough people speaking out
is not speaking out ,
that 's for sure .
just got aggravated about it
if , what would you legislate ?
really do n't know
is not into heavy legislating government of a lot of different areas ,
but do n't know
do find it annoying particularly
is not really sure
with the phone company that we do n't want to receive
and making these calls the people would
identify themselves ,
that would be an interesting way ,
and can have it
and do n't have to have it ,
the trouble of
unlisted numbers even safe now because they have these things
is that right ?
that is interesting .
and just they get .
because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments stop on
is the one next door-to-door solicitors
do n't mind when they are selling for school things the children
have kids
that 's just kind of part of it and
and , it 's annoying as well .
you do n't really know ,
do feel like it 's an invasion of my space , but
these callers telephone
the purpose of that
from different sources
so , and therefore , there is no one answer .
but ,
it 's a survey market basically
just a survey
was caught with along
really just do n't have the time to deal at that moment
but do n't get too many of those
have
someone sell me something
in to a sales pitch , too , just
your time to collect the data
would be willing to consider for which , if they would pay me just
that 's right .
a dollar , but is n't it ,
sort of worry that people sometimes giveaway personal information and also
somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things ,
and start
you and then down
and you do n't know where it 's going to end .
this is most likely not going to be used against you , and
that 's true .
but it could
and that seems
i guess , you never know just .
ca n't really see
if nothing else , they ought to spend money for a postage stamp
now we 're ready .
do you have a personal computer ?
we have one .
, in your home
do not have one in my home
i use one all day , work
but do n't have one at home
you do find a lot you use it ?
use , as much as it
and kind of just , different kinds of storage
on a basic computer
what kind do you 've ?
it 's a gateway brand that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs .
that sounds interesting .
what kind of a computer do you use at work ?
it all day at work
all my personal stuff on it at work and .
a for one at home
did n't have access to one at work all the time
what is that
tracking the flights and things ?
are long
they tell when we 're through .
this is my very first time .
and they tell
you just started
but is going to ignore that
that 's a called on other my line ,
is going to ignore just so it
have that , too
where do you work ?
?
of course .
sure .
of course .
that is , why you 're making these calls ?
are doing this at home
is already home for the day
.
this is a pretty good deal .
ca n't do it at work
the legal department
so are pretty busy
that 's great .
we want to learn
think that 's about my favorite
people how to use
that 's great .
it 's really ,
do n't know how to do on it
but every time .
have a question
for on .
do start calling in myself
or do wait for people to call me ?
did they give you a number to call ?
eight hundred and number .
you can start calling in whenever it are convenient for you
but you can only make one called a day .
a day only one
you are talking
you can not so now until tomorrow make a call .
.
then , so do you get the five bucks
or do ?
both
both
did n't ?
have put in that
so both
that 's a pretty good deal .
from
we doing this
it is for research .
is actually doing this for a friend of mine
it 's a project type research on activated electronics voice .
it is almost like a computer thing command type voice .
they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up .
big companies from
do n't know everything about it
is that
but they try to get as they can to contribute to this possibly as many people
and they can check patterns voice that way .
,
different kinds of voices and things .
the computer
is going to say
and think
to you
probably so .
and you 're in what city ?
how about that
you probably did .
they just moved recently there .
that is interesting .
work and then at
they use personal computers
actually
they have both personal computers .
do they do their correspondence on it ?
use for her children hers children 's games
so , we started
i guess ,
do n't know
a phone call on it
so you pressed one ?
we are supposed to start talking
what kind of books
my aunt got me hooked on those .
so it 's all novels mostly ?
they are all novels .
read too
like what ?
like
it was from this and is more of a play or something
the book from that and .
and , by the way , my name is bill .
's see
what kind of books do you like to read ?
fair number of novels , but mostly shorter ones
really have to be in the mood
once a year
read anything by him
he is now dead ,
but he was really a pretty amazing writer .
that was pretty short
but they were still
see 's
found that interesting real
is right now reading the lion and the wind
what is that ?
this is
and portrays really him as a , kind of a crazy man .
.
had no idea that he was like that
how crazy ?
saw the movie
me want to read the book
is a big real fan of hers
is interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things
like to read some of the stuff philosophy
see 's
, and even do n't believe in quite like reading some things , things new age
it is all about how to out of experiences body , and all that have .
's fascinated by that
's fascinated by that
stories , but real encounters
and like to read stuff like that
some of it
got past all the gibberish on it
you did like it ?
was
to get into it really
it did n't help me that much .
.
once , you are set in your ways
were looking for a job ,
i read , how to get the job you wanted
and , it had real good tips
your favorite team or what you think will be doing well this year
, course , and we 've duke university that was the national champions last year ,
again this year
they have a lot of the same players back .
this is college basketball .
this is college ,
so hopefully , we 'll have a good year .
that 's all i saw and probably .
what we have n't really followed them too much
none of them and
so , that seems to help .
do you like professional basketball ?
especially around the playoffs
now that that 's over , and maybe they 'll come out of it
that 's an coming up and team , though .
hope
to
or they 're not going to have any of the team left at all .
that 's somebody you can get behind and be patient , .
the cowboys , i guess
they be kind of not having a few very good seasons
coming out
are it
the bulls ?
they 'll probably be pretty good .
that 's true .
that 's true ,
it will be interesting .
it certainly will be different .
'll follow , though
the season started yet
more of the season person the
we need and talk about baseball
are the season basketball
it 's a long season .
it is ,
my mind went blank
was so long
really started even thinking about basketball yet
but , this was n't
but , we 'll see how come .
it 's a little early .
we will definitely .
it 's good talking to you .
good to talk to you .
are we
what ,
that 's an interesting assortment .
my husband 's
in his miles for the time it get
is not quite bad that
nothing like .
some things
have started selling them at craft shows and things
that 's pretty good .
have done at them fairly well and
of my hobby little projects a
most , of them , but .
only my work craft 's kind of like computers
made at it , too
considering i work for a living it
have , but
kind of
what does a computer club
did n't know there was such things
just all over the place
half the members
the other half not really
kind of help the people out
, is a hacker
do n't go
that 's kind of interesting hobby .
you did
what was the other thing ?
to a boy scout troop
it paying united way
we 've done that .
so we 've done a fair amount of that in our spare time , also .
that 's a great thing to do really .
's
north of us
that
that one
that one
that one
think of the name of it
no memory .
missed out this last year
was n't able to get off the time ,
maybe next year but
it 's a good possibility .
that would be a real thing to do fun
that was of fun loads .
does your whole family like to do it ,
not quite because is not a whole family
is just me
my kids
sometimes ,
on them and making payments on them and things like that
sometimes think that might not be a bad idea
they have a bunch of people .
probably ,
probably
which is in now .
have done that
try to figure out how to make usually when
supposed to talk
have you got a boat ?
n't
do you ?
n't
have one for quite a few years
the one of years
but , it 's
do you like boating ?
.
all but my children have been for a few years grown
we were using it less and less and less , and
so we decided to sell it .
what is that ?
the day you sell your boat .
having a boat
having it
heard that just
that 's just a joke , i guess .
'd like to have one but
the time to use it
he be able to use it or a day during the week or something
but ,
, do n't know
got out my money 's worth
got within all those years
so real well , you take care of them .
you could n't complain about that so .
you did
it was a big boat , big boat ski thing type .
occasionally did fishing out of it ,
, but did enjoy owning a boat
like to fish
would recommend it to anybody
have never now and sailing
you have
have
nothing big
never have tried
, i bet that would be more fun
have always
want to bad enough to make
at this stage of the game is not interested that and
they are getting kind of old
so we get occasionally out on the water .
that 's nice .
anyway , but it is fun .
do enjoy the lake ,
we 'd and go down there
we 'd and go for a ride and so much enjoy it .
it 's a pretty lake such down there .
we 'd enjoy it so much
and are going to leave the boat out , because we 'll probably do this again tomorrow
where the boat were still sitting there
we never did again go out and
'd have to go load it up the next day and
where 's that ?
is that
it 's just a hundred miles from here .
what
you go down , thirty .
thirty .
it is
of here
hundred miles due
we just moved here down a couple years ago ,
you did ?
where you all move from did ?
you did ?
love up there
is that
we like pretty good here , but .
think you 'll like it better ,
but of course , it 's hard when .
we got
my called folks , and they want to see
it 's too hard on your folks
known
supposed to be
that 's right .
n't
a friend of a program manager there up
n't either
my wife do .
but , it 's a good company .
we are supposed to be talking anyway , but
back to boats .
you went for a boat ride .
that 's boating .
that have have been fun .
it was fun ,
it was fun .
we paying too much in taxes
we pay for
what 's your opinion ?
kind of
we get pretty well , ,
a lot of especially in federal government , which we 're changed short areas
was in the air force and
equipment ever on at
and just
agree with you
studies to do so many do n't mean anything
know something does n't work or something , does n't exist
but , it could be put to more practical use .
into doing something for the people , which is really unfortunate that they represent worthwhile
that 's true .
with you in that area
read and how our politicians voted each week in the paper .
and it is interesting
they ran on
and do n't really
and unless they are in the limelight and under pressure .
so
we got
that 's very true .
what do you live ?
i work for
it hurt us a lot
tend to think the solution to everything is throw money at it
n't and
that 's just not true .
do n't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or problem solving skills
too many things that money ca n't buy
that 's true .
what you do work ?
we 're comparable .
got
our taxes went up tremendously .
and it 's not going to get any better .
it 's going up and up and up .
remember there were about four , five years
that is incredible ?
the biggest mess
raising anybody 's salary if
are not going to complain because we all got a pay raise this year , but
all you got a pay raise this year .
that is correct ?
think the teachers , did
and do n't know about administrators
was an administrator , and
so do n't get a raise anymore
my pay does n't change .
you on the early retirement
you enjoying it
very much
part-time two jobs
so , it is not really total retirement .
see 's
's twenty
old how
's older
older .
older than you

we 're going to go in march after my children 's birthdays and get all that business out of the way .
it 's very cold .
so , do you travel a lot
we do travel a lot ?
was a travel agent
have been up until just a few months ago
of going back to work
a lot of good spots vacation
a lot of good places to go
that 's your favorite ?
it is my favorite .
'd like to take there and him
all over the united states
and have n't
have n't been down south
have you been there ?
have n't
where do you live ?
we have some pretty nice weather
that 's a pretty good deal so .
.
do you ?
not only and best
's best my customer , but
since we 're not supposed to talk about this , though , there is anything
you do know ?
n't
have that , too
need something ,
need more
than the intensive eye ?
did n't know if there were anything else
think it 's a wonderful product
you do use it ?
,
we get every month
that 's great .
work there about a year
that 's good .
what good
they are
that 's great .
so we are supposed to be talking
do you go to school ?
you do ski ?
i
n't
that 's great .
pretty good
do like to ski
pretty down there
do like to ski
just because it is up and kind of nice being .
that kind of thing
you are a sophomore .
actually is
of my junior year .
you 're
good for you
are
.
good for you
you sound like a girl who had it together .
encourage you just
because you wo n't have the money or the time when .
thought
known
do n't be in any hurry
, is not
is not
have a down payment on a new car or that
and took the trip
and it was great ?
and we have just a ball .
how long you did get stay there ?
six weeks .
it was
so should you think about doing something like that .
she and there were all winter semester .
we are supposed to discuss crime in the united states ; and what can be done with it .
that 's a rather broad topic .
they usually are pretty
where do you live ?
where
that is so frightening .
it is ,
you do have children in school ?
in college
that 's my oldest his first year in high school
so we have all this to look forward to ,
think you ca n't even send them to school in safety
when you ca n't even on their normal activities in safety , send them , but it 's really frightening
that 's true .
coming down on
but really do n't know what they can do
it 's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs
really do n't know what can be done and
just do n't understand , in my little world how guns could be so available , of course
n't either
really just apparently they but .
and my son tells me he hear talking about having guns kids
about two weeks ago and someone come with a gun to his football practice .
scared and just
and they called
nothing happened , and
but it could easily have .
maybe is that the answer to crime is getting more prosecution .
maybe .
and people do n't do anything .
and said all the neighbors .
but nobody did anything .
just ca n't imagine that
someone calling for help
the police to say
do n't blame people with today 's society about going out to help themselves
something , maybe not going over , because it could be dangerous , there
ca n't , but certainly not understand calling the police
one of the best things we could do for crime and is probably participate in its prevention ourselves .
think you 're right there
in their own business
but think that 's real dangerous
and do n't know
try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of what is around them
and , if a situation that looks like it could
, do n't know
, do n't know
people just have to care about another person
maybe , maybe this thing that will with the child at school .
, do n't know
it 's really frightening .
let
he did n't have a license for the gun ?
do n't know
do n't know the details
this was not a child that was on the team .
up at the field of
it was a person student age ,
are
nice
is that
television show ?
that sounds good .
, do n't watch too many
but we can try it .
you ready to start
.
just a
are we
your favorite shows television
if there is no one else around so it 's just
but for just thought
sometimes it designing women
that i love
do you ?
that 's great .
it is fun .
and then there 's
that just
reading in today 's paper they just canceled that show .
it 's a real different one .
it is different .
seen the show called
have n't
it 's really good .
it is set in post world war two times and
it 's really interesting .
sounds
it is ,
it 's really written well .
what station ?
tell you even
what other shows do you like ?
she comes on later
have with it , i guess
and ca n't catch those anymore
did watch ever those
that 's right .
they are stupid .
was so when
anymore , but
that can happen .
any other shows in
to seeing golden girls
that is fun always .
that show
it is exciting ,
we 're winning ,
that is so exciting really .
course , like , also to catch the news during the evening hours
the kids wanting to talk all at the same time
a whole lot of
we 'll catch our news that way .
is going to be like
have n't been catching it because of my work schedule lately
the last time
it is
our full three minutes or not
, do n't know
and say they come on
that 's right .
it was really interesting .
it is interesting .
doing just this as a fund-raiser for our church
that 's nice .
so it kind of make it easy to do a little something for it .
in kind of house
ours pretty similar
living in one
do n't have a swimming pool
think it 's pretty much typical for this area
it is .
have you been living very there long ?
have been in the house about twelve and a half years
so you have been there longer .
see 's
it 's been six and a half years ago ,
and we have an architect
and enjoyed it really because we built what we wanted to have to live in
my husband got his big garage .
we have a car garage three , that he has a big area work in
he likes and
and so , he had all the space work he needs
that sounds interesting .
having it that way
because
it is ,
and that 's why we decided to build .
was already
small even if they were three garages car is what we have
then , most of them do n't have a garage three car .
they are kind of rare .
three in a car garage
even if they had three car garages , but , they did n't have a space work
all of it was taken up with just car space .
and where that he can work on the house start
we 've got a car garage two , just
sounds like our husbands have similar interests .
mine , do not work
.
it is not in your house
it 's really .
a lot of
, do n't know
got back that some furniture
have so up
college come home
as a guest bedroom and other the room because we use .
his parents come
the kids and stay and also
and so it seems
all three of my daughters
, but do n't know
i
we 've got now grandchildren and ,
so they have to have a place when .
that 's true
and you do n't want them to not be able to come because there is no room .
that 's right ,
n't sure
at times .
yet reached
have heard people say that
but my middle son 's
the same girl for
and , he had a good job
he 's not
my daughter and is
but she is still in college
and we 're happy just as for her first to finish her education .
that 's what she plans to do .
do n't blame for that you
so i hope
have the girls three
little boys and a lot more than whole girls .
a whole new world
coming for doses short
can understand
they know .
but , they are fun .
just .
up when my kids little was never
with them and have n't
try to teach them not to get into things
the same thing that
with
the same attitudes
my daughters have at least .
they try to teach theirs instead of having to put up everything not to get into things .
so it 's
really do n't think anything 's been broken
and we 've kind and of going to say , do n't bother this then every now
, but they all mind , all in pretty well .
what kind of roof does your house have ?
is here
about crime in the city
all big plenty cities have of
statistics , obviously
it is ,
was the other day listening to the news , but
because so was a lot of it , the reason it was up
economy is so bad .
do you really believe that ?
it 's been up every year for many years
for so long been
is that
that 's just what they quoted over the news .
know that if not
but , it does seem up
what kind of newspaper do you get there down ?
what kind ?
think we got a pretty good newspaper
the morning news
news morning seem to have the largest circulation .
a locally owned paper
the times out
do they play the local angles crime up
n't
not really ,
they do n't play it up
it too many homes
last year
this is a topic of personal interest so .
but , in our neighborhood so many , have been
so you saw this happening in your neighborhood
and you figured it would n't happen to you .
sort of .
never did get a security system , and
since that happened , but certainly .
what kind of system do you 've ?
the infrared motion detector
pretty
is this one with some company that services and you take your calls and all that stuff ?
and all that
of the line the other
it or be enough to have a thing that makes loud noise just ?
think the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice
really .
that was part of it for three years to so
the monitoring is not bad , though that
or not
and they pretty quickly , called back
think so it 's all right
that 's a pretty good deterrent in itself ,
so you got a sign up there says .
.
how does it do that ?
who know
but that 's
think it probably do these things pretty good supposedly and
so many of
n't all you have a pretty high crime rate up there
is not saying it is any higher than anybody else 's
here or not ,
the statistics say that but
do n't know
of the country now the murder
is that right ?
would probably gather from drugs
think that 's the reason it are so high everywhere and
little these small cities and all , , would n't have
they but .
their children were just
so , what 's the solution ?
that 's a good question .
, do n't know
do n't know what the solution is
n't really
have n't but
and nothing seems to change .
but , they want to buy ,
supply and demand
long as somebody wants to buy it , somebody going to provide it for them .
, do n't know what the solution is so
n't really
do n't think anyone do , in fact
children two of
have got two boys four one year old , and one two years old ,
so are just starting out
that 's quite a spread .
husband , everything .
that 's great .
like to try and spend a lot of time with them
they are not very old ,
so they could n't do a whole lot , yet .
but they like to spend time with me .
various things , nothing
they like to be outside as much as possible .
but the weather is trying to turn now
you know .
what ,
have to answer a phone business
on this called do it
is that
a r e ,
just a record message , on our phone business
is
keep going
it is
a lot of friends that we have , they have a tendency to do the same thing
how you did handle that , where they were growing up ?
there were not nearly as much of it .
think things was quite a bit different in fact
all the mothers was when big my kids was little home .
the kids got up in the morning
when they felt like it , and then they went out to play when they were little like that .
think it 's gotten very different and
or you got some cartoons
that was it , and
but they never was interested in it that anyway .
their trucks out in the backyard
but just always , we did .
we did a lot of stuff like that with our kids .
course , when they got they were both quite into sports and bigger
we 'd go along with
a girl and is very different .
a girl would
so , they are very , very different ,
last night was a band concert
one of our older kids now are going down graduate school
that 's nice .
we go down there for a weekend for family get-togethers and stuff like that fairly often .
that 's great .
that 's great .
a little bit older and .
is being outside just good for them
because they like just being outside .
i thought , our kids just always dearly
, we lived up when our big ones were little
so it 's very different
that 's true ,
you do
have two cats
two and fish .
two cats ,
you 're lucky .
two your fish .
and what do you 've ?
how along on everything except major one thing , sometimes when
in the farm to me , but he belongs up
he does in your house sleep ?
and then he goes out for the day .
but this is a beautiful dog
with our little girls
is this huge and .
course , when he run around the yard , he digs , just
he does n't know he is tearing up things ,
but he does .
had with him when he was about eight months was
did not know what to expect from a dog having not have one , and
while left him in the kitchen with the baby little gates and
come home and
my wallpaper off my wall
and it was in the floor
and lost it just about
and called
, come home and get
have you
he kept picking at it
the kitchen
and picked a hole in it .
it is either me or the dog ,
he love this dog
and he 's a good dog ,
is having just to get used
with the topic they called
have
grew up with cats , but
my cats
had my cat
she 's old .
you then broke your heart .
it was awful ,
it was just awful .
she just sat on my lap and there .
she just waited
it was awful .
that make me feel so bad .
she liked his shoes and just
and he 'd have these hundred dollar shoes .
it was just bad .
and it was something .
that 's awful ,
never heard of that before
it was terrible .
she must have known he did n't like her or something .
or the smell or something
would bar the closet doors
it was just awful .
does your cat sleep in the house ?
that was very funny .
cats house
right now have two cats
with my kids
it does n't do anything .
are not going to have a dog
we have two dogs
after we have them for several years , just little nice outside dogs
, was just my kids ' friends
would go running
and the last one got hit as she was following one of my sons across the road to the school .
it was awful .
and but
is not a person dog and
wreck things
is not either
is not either
would n't want a lab
it sounds beautiful ,
he is beautiful
it 's just one of those concessions
but i kind of
and it is
people doing their fires
brought him in because he is just a wet mess out there and
the laundry room with
if you 'll be nice wo n't make
your girls and ?
it smells of cedar always
think they are cutting off us
somebody cut on my line in
and do n't want to answer
'll just wait
have got incoming calls
cut off
, would cut off they
i
so we 'll just wait .
is it will called back .
they 'll pretty soon cut off us .
called for my kids
known
actually , it is my son ,
it is
never he likes to come home from school .
that 's what we 've anyway ,
and have tried to start a fish tank
keeps losing all my fishing and
in the water salt ?
regular just water
you do repair your own car ?
, to
tell , what
it 's really good when someone can do some things to a car themselves .
'll tell you ,
the cars get over the years
do as much as
have n't
is that right ?
it got
and just ca n't keep up
.
was never
they do n't , course
that 's right .
have always done a lot of changing brakes and now
n't anymore
have a lot of times , but
i
my last car repair actually had to do with brakes
and did not do myself
took it
and that did n't do the trick
, it did n't it
that was n't even actually eventually the problem .
could think
called just brakes and eventually
there are brakes disc
they ended up having to pound it out .
it was just
having to buy up so
it was just under two hundred dollars
it was n't really
actually think it was a lot of money ,
it was a lot of money ,
did n't know what was going on
, you did n't you
that 's right ,
that 's right .
you do still do much work on them , then ?
.
do and try
'd actually say this
disposal is a problem .
that is one problem ,
just ca n't beat them , places these fast oil change , but also
that 's true .
that 's true .
that ,
doing that myself
but was one of the main reasons the disposal of the oil .
that 's right .
but
the main reason and
they just raised our taxes here up about a year ago .
they have statewide raises ,
constantly
we just passed a new one ,
and we have passed a provisional one that we would raise our taxes , if they did locate here .
but we thought we 'd get something back from that at least .
how do you feel about taxes ?
it seems like a big politics
last year , up here , the governor was up for re-election
so he said the budget , were fine
did n't have any money
right after he won the election and then said he
so they raised all our taxes .
now it 's time election again and
so they are trying to lower them .
so they are just
but never
they just keep raising them .
have never seen taxes really go down
neither me
going here because they did n't have a budget for so
the real tax rate for the last three months of this year
and they 're going to lower it for next year .
had a budget
that they put
they 're going to lower ,
'll see , but
the middle class people supporting the nation
the poor and of course , ca n't afford it either
is a middle class person income anyway
of supporting the whole country
do so
is barely middle class ,
the rich paying not enough
think they are paying too much
the rich paying too much
is that if you 're in the three percent bracket , and they take a third of your check every month ridiculous
working ?
is talking the really about rich
should they just tax everybody no matter what you make the same amount .
that would be fair .
'll go along with that ,
no loopholes or anything
think that would be fair
for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review
you make this , you pay
if you make a hundred dollars , you pay ,
if you make a million dollars , you pay .
that 's the way our state tax is here .
think it 's pretty fair
our stated taxes
not and they 've got
no matter
what they are supposed to
and it 's not enough at .
up for all what they should be taking out
but it 's been for the last probably ten years that way .
you have to check
of the year the
and you do n't have it to give it to them .
unless you have a lot of deductions .
if you have a lot of federal deduction , but it ends up .
you may get hundred dollars nine back from federal
and it 's ridiculous just .
but do n't know
and that 's a chunk .
'll say
believe is one of the major things that is wrong with our public school system
the teachers discipline that the way the children
with that
went to school
you were ?
and is totally different just
these days in the classroom
they act up pretty bad .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
in is what grade your daughter ?
that 's my daughter in the fourth grade
the teacher can not
when was just school and n't
they always had a paddle in our school .
n't just
known
and all sorts of lawsuits because of things like that
pay a good share towards the school system , that
and we do n't have still .
and paid a little bit more the teachers
was n't what part of the lottery is going to go
that supposedly is
'll and just
do n't know your feelings toward that
we should n't get into that
what else and
in some ways that they need be more careful thought .
that teachers out there
some horrible , horrible stories about teachers high school
and be careful more
that may be wrong with the school system
think they 're doing a pretty good job right now
too
think they 're doing real good job
what to do know , , but then ,
you do n't have any children in school
do n't have any kids
none at all
a real hard for you
we can now discontinue our called
it was a joy in talking with you .
it was good talking too .
we 'll see ,
never have done before it ,
have to do so
so guess .
called several times
pushed and , in my number
they kept saying that you have the invalid code
found out and then my new phone was n't working right
have done it even
wonder how long it 's going to be on for
this whole thing ,
for two months or something ,
you do know ?
do n't know
back to crime ,
we are supposed to talk
they say , worried about
for every aspect one is worried about
there are so much going on here .
in the schools
known
is aware of
heard just last week at that one school
on the school grounds after school last year we have
is that right ?
a few years ago , in a school grade , and the one boy killed himself
these kids do n't have any trouble getting a holding of in any neighborhood guns
at all .
it is kind of scary to think you send your child to school
wonder and if
we did n't
known
what next ?
, known
it 's been out ,
and it just continues to get worse .
we ca n't really depend on the police to solve all this , and
they just ca n't do it .
think it goes all the way back to the breaking
and how we going together bring that back .
,
, it is that
home n't with the children
and that may impact it as well .
think so
and then there are , really
, just do n't bother them
think years past maybe a little more morals our criminals have n't would kill in cold blood somebody
they do n't think twice about it .
think it was just rare ,
really .
and he wanted to marry her ,
and she would n't marry him
one day he drove out in the country
himself and her ?
a thing in those days that it was in all the papers
i bet
, known
it 's just another killing .
was watching some
and they were talking
lots of their picture and life story , and everything
their life story to
they came from a broken family
this person had mental problems
--
, known
we up all these twisted people and before
is that right ?
think it was on a hard copy ,
she was a real blond attractive girl , in her freshman year of college
some boy , he was in his twenties , and
seeing that
remember that ?
saw on hard copy that .
is that right ?
can you believe ,
is
and he just shot them himself and her .
seeing that
is n't that weird ?
there are crazy just too many people out there these days .
, known
some sort of a crime
just on the phone
that 's not doing anything .
think they are kind of ambivalent , really
of out of both sides of mouths down there
we do n't know
much without running their country for them
that 's just it .
it is
let you still have , but
, we 're going to have supporters
like you and said they are small countries such , that we 're bound to upset somebody ,
to take the ability
is sure we have some enemies down there that would n't care of course
that 's a tough deal , but
that 's true .
maybe , it 's
the competing factions in lot of those countries
it 's going on , and still
that 's about the lump sum of it .
she was from a relatively wealthy family , and
is
's blank on it
talking about
forget his name
, known
he he took basically just
kind of
dictator ,
a dictator
so easily susceptible to that kind of thing
unstable .
think it is long overdue
there are so much difference in the economies of the two countries ,
have a problem with whether it 's going to work or not ,
but it seems like there is a lack of honesty in a lot of the times foreign policy .
the big problem with the united states is that we have our basic nine to five schedule ,
we have our way of life
you like
antique tools for one thing
's sort of in an antique business ,
but it 's a little sideline , part time thing .
it is
have been working on it for five years ,
but how
you close to getting it to do
there are still a lot of work to be done , of course
have a lot of stuff to do
you going to move your whole family over there then
actually is not even sure ,
may
escape .
but it is beautiful ,
it 's eastern hardwood forest ,
but it is mostly oaks
beautiful ,
and it 's pretty flat there ?
but , it 's low hills ,
liked the hills , and the trees ,
for time in service
, have been there never
is that
my sisters like it pretty well
at which one
he is admissions director .
it 's just north .
he 's got a job there
this is his first year , and
so , it 's been a real interesting thing for them .
that 's great .
like it
think they are too far away from me ,
but they can get closer , maybe some day
we 'll see .
good trip .
's mother of four ,
is basically just , real busy with my kids in sports right now , so
the schools
that 's great .
, is a travel agent at heart
i love , and more
but , it 's hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have children four and a husband , real
gave up that career
interesting all this week
and are enjoying it
is around my kids
and
that 's pretty easy ?
it is great ,
it is great ,

that 's great .
i play
i love tennis too

that 's great .
have you ever been there ?
wonderful place
can hardly wait to get up there
too
you guys getting snow

of the mountains the dry
and is just a real nightmare
can imagine
ski and .
all my children
sun valley several times to
went to school ,
, have n't been there
either have n't
city ,
all your kids
not all of them
my kids grown
but my youngest son is a skier .
that 's great .
they 're fearless ,
do n't do a lot of it
do love to fish
good ,
can maybe learn something
do n't know how much you can learn
, is good at it
do enjoy doing it , but
do you ?
it is
told last night when my husband
the different kinds of
hope it is ,
there is not a whole lot of different kinds .
know how to do
but we have a lot of lakes here in this area
a lot of
lakes in
and the timing of days
quite a bit of it
.
there is a lake two or three miles from here ,
want to get away and sit and think just
is a good way to do that ,
a lot of
do you have a boat ?
n't
and we use that sometimes .
, had a boat
but n't
the ones around here big , so that you can fish off the dock
unless you have a boat but you ca n't really
is the same way here
it is ?
the lake , is beautiful and
of the dock and fishing the
really catching fishing , but you do n't actually do much of that right there .
a lot of old little perch
do is feed them a little bit
but it 's kind of fun .
but we do have a awful lot of in our lakes snakes .
would be afraid of that
and ca n't think into one or two of them
do they ever get on your hook ?
'll catch an on a hook , but the never snakes eel occasionally
poisonous snakes
we have a lot of cotton mouth ,
so
, definitely
every once in
'd be a little bit afraid of those
they are
it was probably inches in diameter or something like that four .
great big
of course , it scared and the women to death ,
and said the men
it wo n't hurt you really .
but it looked so bad
but sure we felt like it was hurting us , just being there
.
but they are
you do
that 's pretty much the same way here .
they have a lot of tournaments bass .
we have those .
inevitably never catch a thing if
just going out there
enter a tournament or anything
we 're not
early in the morning there 'll be all the boats going out ,
and they 'll say , there 's a big tournament bass this weekend ,
all those people here for the tournament
really sport
they 're really into it to try to win .
.
certainly here .
a very relaxing sport to be able to be on the water and looking around out just
is the peace and calmness
and sit back and read
is that
taking a book with me
'll have to try that one of these days
my mind went when kind of blank .
have n't taken back for a long time anything
either , have n't
returning things
and take everything back again
it 's a game to her ,
do not like to do that , but
consider it kind of a waste of my time
usually so are pretty careful
things over if it 's an appliance or something to make sure it has the features in it
had it for
it was n't just working ,
missing from it and .
my husband opened up it
and we do n't have any more , of course
we ca n't take back so it .
of course ,
a lot of goods
get by five years you just
throw away rather than it
we 're a wasteful society , for sure .
that 's true ,
and usually you get .
and they were ten dollars ,
nice work for the little kids
and they did n't work worth anything .
we took those back ,
and that 's about that
all that were taken back in ages .
you know what you 're getting ahead of time , pretty well
and if you buy a good one , you should n't have too much of a problem with it ,
it 's hard .
the car and would go
and it would stop
and with the manufacturer
, it seems like ,
, and still do n't have
they know when it 's old they 're going to buy ,
think that 's true ,
now , a warranty and at least should go wrong with it .
my husband 's really good at fixing things too
usually he
do n't know if they are making them better or not ,
it 's hard to say .
make things break easier ,
think , but the technology is better
think technology is better ,
is not sure
got
about
do n't
everything is
an awful lot of things
that 's true .
if so , .
sell stuff at shows
of this middle east affair we 've got on going on
our own borders than
have to agree with you there
just let
.
we 've got so many domestic problems ,
what does it cost and these people over there .
so how about the soviet union
think is going to happen there
the breaking ?
think that 's great
is glad to see
, and so are not much in favor of it
but is glad to see
that does n't seem to cost a whole lot of money .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
have at least some sort of a domestic agenda ,
even if it does n't work , at least he is somebody who is working
so they do n't seem to have a clue .
is important ,
wo n't just
there are the homeless issue , and then
and we would n't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we are spending .
.
be sort of the world bank , , as far as
think there 's a limit , and
and we passed it a long time ago .
.
we 've been writing off country way many too bad debts .
's things like selling technology and even to foreign governments military hardware and then forgiving their debt
to me that just do n't
known
do n't know
think it 's time for a change , definitely
, but do n't see
are turning into a black and white society ,
you do this way it either
you or that way
and there 's no in between
that 's right ,
you 're either liberal or you are conservative ,
and it is n't working obviously .
think that it would n't hurt ,
the independent party get a real force in congress
you 're right , but
and think if we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed
with you .
of course it seems to me that every time he open his mouth , he
not so , it 's too often
he is the one of the two that votes ,
he is one of the two .
, very
see 's
in for six years
and when you guys did vote into office him ?
are you
with him for a little while longer
you keep with current events up ?
somewhat .
somewhat
not ,
would like probably not as well
is that right ?
but that 's the way it goes .
what ?
state college ,
do you ,
we 're not
we are supposed to talk .
try to watch the news , so
the newspaper
like to read and time magazine , and people magazine to keep up with what 's going on in the world
.
you interested in
little about everything
not then again
like to know what 's happening pretty well , but
just around the world interest me the events .
stay in touch with it and .
of my children , none of them all three
.
but always have been
stay and up .
, stay aware of most of the current events
some of both
the newspapers
that 's good .
and
then up pretty well stay
that not badly
is interested in what is going on , so
you have been there
.
you would be interested in it then .
,
just do n't read everything about it ,
but always be aware of what is going on like that
because it is interesting
and do n't know ,
down there for those people
that 's true .
what they have never had a good leader , really
think it 's been better since he died , and
but it is still been bad
read some things about him that he was n't too good himself
for certain things off
.
those people
it is the only thing that work
as a good coverage as
really .
a little to
the media , do
and it 's over the same thing over and over and over
to the radio
so much
you get of it
only so again , but
do n't believe it could be better
n't really
think it could always be better ,
would agree that it 's pretty good , but
do n't think so
do n't think our news could be better
to make it better
do n't see that they could do anything
do n't know
want always
what you 're saying ,
think by trial and error over the years , but they got about it as good as they 're going to get it
that may be so ,
nothing is perfect .
is not always
that 's true ,
what you 're saying ,
understand why they ca n't dig too much deeper , and then again
that is in fact
that sounds interesting .
have out
there is this stuff
painting and .
.
so , it 's real fun .
started doing it as just something to do fun ,
and now is selling them
how it is going ?
pretty good
started last week , just
and sold seven
was n't
that sounds great .
somebody do it
that 's right .
that is correct .
i kind of have fads hobby , i guess .
were growing up
my latest one is now classic cars .
almost , had it done
and and
but it was fun .
enjoyed it really
how you 'd learn to do that to fix them up ?
how to do it or what
to buy the car
was just in a supermarket
bought and so it
started ordering some parts and just
did n't do to the engine too much , because the engine was pretty good ,
just kind
where you 'd get the car ?
bought up before it and there
that 's true ,
that 's true .
that sounds
's see
that covers about mine
see 's
is a person hobby
have always done a lot of stuff craft
and ,
see 's
what else ?
started collecting music boxes
that is a hobby
that 's .
that is interesting .
many music boxes
about twenty probably .
different songs
some of the same song
different songs
is that
what 's the most expensive one you bought ?
the most expensive
do n't know
have gotten all of them for gifts
that is interesting .
that 's true .
never collected those
that is interesting , boxes music .
have dolls from all over too
, was a little girl
and have a lot of dolls
always people would
bought a doll everywhere
economy .
it was great ,
it was quick .
was in high school ,
, and was in a tour
it is kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries ,
it was called to people people , and
and we 'd stay in people 's homes ,
and then we got to also big tour cities ,
and enjoyed it really
was in high school
or that was a thing college ?
was in high school
was
i bet
that 's true .
that sound .
always thought
but who knows now
got
some days and
maybe it 's one of those things retirement .
go there .
he likes it all right .
he does help out much
you do have any pets ?
now have a dog and cat
their names
which is the dog
which is the cat and ?
liberty and is the cat .
have two cats
one is real nice ,
she is pretty wild .
ours pretty calm
pets just house
that are too
was our cat we got the night she from the pound
is so that
that is a nice story .
my other animals
had rats
had mice
see 's
had a son was an animal lover
it was
and we have
and it was very aggressive .
nobody came when he was there near it .
had a dog one time ,
it was still in the instinct of them to back up and get ready
is one question we have other
, do n't know
kind of
, do n't know
your lap and stuff like
, do n't know
as a dog 'd come back
what do you think ?
that 'd be the best way to be .
do you like big dogs or little dogs ?
about three or four years where we had just about lift him and carry him every place he went
so , when he died , we got a little one .
for him to walk
he could n't get up ,
he could n't walk ,
he was a hundred and twenty pounds ,
so it was a chore .
so the next time around we 'd get something that if something happened , it would be easier to carry little we said .
we and then had three in our married life cats
do you ?
she is the nice one .
we used to live in an apartment
our cats , and never went outside
but the neighbors , used to let out their dogs
and our neighbors was
up getting fleas from the apartment that we were in
so , we have
they did n't
do n't even talk to me ,
was away for the weekend ,
out and he
was and
you walked in
your legs and was just black .
and never we got back the cat
found it in the street
we have a tent ,
's memory
just we did n't take
and it got cold really at night ,
we were and of course
and , we take along games that we can play with the kids and just that kind of stuff .
that sounds like fun .
would take my dad ,
there was four of us kids ,
'd take he ,
and it was always fun ,
my dad would
and have always it
and we 'd catch our supper hopefully ,
but we never did
but it was always fun .
was always
she 'd and bring along something we , because tradition had it
we have always so , something along to eat ,
it was always and an enjoyable experience .
and there 's no hills ,
it 's flat ,
was in high school , and then
was able to catch some things by then , but of course
but , it was always fun .
in the hills , you can see ,
to go ahead .
there are lots of mountains around to camp in there , and and stuff and of course streams .
is not
but it 's just a lot of trees ,
it 's not too bad .
they could call them that ,
they are not bad .
it driving a thousand miles , to find a mountain , i guess
that 's right .
.
still you get over the shock culture
find my way around
are happy if
the ideal times to camp in this area early spring , and , in the fall
what does on your yard do you ?
lawn typical stuff
come back in the yard
you do n't so
yourself
myself
, too , .
for me a lot of people do it
the truth that are n't .
need the exercise ,
so what
that 's right .
my husband , do the same thing
he does the yard ,
keep but
you 've got the right idea .
that 's right .
about three weeks ago
and yellow bronze
and they 're just gorgeous ,
last week in town , and then come so
, now you tell
and we covered with a sheet them ,
okay and they did .
and did n't do it ,
have
have n't gone yet to check out
do n't blame you
would n't want to look at them
listen ,
was the third year
it was about four years ago
and we pulled by raking it just almost half of our yard , up
it would just come in the rake , down to the dirt off .
it took a lot of money , and a lot of time ,
you think that 's what it was .
we found them
we found them .
under there about an inch
and you could see them .
they are real white fat little things ,
into black in the spring bugs
them in the beds flower
they said every yard had some
had some of that problem ,
mine was but freeze .
that too ,
is what you 're talking
, especially under the trees
and of
and bought about twenty of them
you did too
it is what they 've done in the spring or the fall .
that was late ,
, there are different times
had and
keep
just living and
they are pretty tough ,
you can stand those .
it 'll do pretty well , and usually
one of these really cold deals
same way ,
they warned finally me of that one .
and we did n't know the difference .
your list , are growing
and my backyard , we have it really nice ,
he is now three ,
as long as
if there is anything he 'll hurt , and we just do n't put it out there any more
your for the beds flower possibilities
very much ,
you did .
it did pretty well ,
from the alley in our garages
ours
and it 's a little piece of land over there .
what did you grow ?
that 's amazing .
put them in a salad , though ,
and you say
at least it 's mine .
do n't mind necessarily paying taxes
sometimes just wonder if our money is being used in the best way .
and that 's all tax money .
how many politicians and each one it is getting that much just billions of dollars
that 's just being thrown away .
and then they are spending all the money on these studies on have no relevance whatsoever , when
what we are paying , it 's not that we mind paying taxes , it is that we are paying
agree with that
is not
think there 's just too many levels of bureaucracy and
think it can be managed by less levels
work with
it is the person who is making a hundred thousand there never .
it is always the person who is making the least amount ,
and we are sometimes running around there .
these , supervisors running around having meetings
do n't really
they really doing anything
think we 're going to see a streamlining in the government
, this is too much
we 're not going to pay any more ,
we 're not going to pay for this ,
and you are out .
think we are starting to see a little bit now ,
and how they 're going to go about doing it
getting just
and that 's not me making a whole lot of money .
because something like that , and you are paying a little tax here
do n't know about you guys ,
you do n't and
we got a sales tax .
our sales tax , is eight percent
and do n't know what is our gas tax
twenty five cents a gallon around
they are so hitting up us ,
raise it as much one year
'll , but then
it 's just you can see your money is not just going that far .
but they changed the deductions on you ,
that raise your taxes , and just
just a different way they get
to me , so it did raise my taxes .
how much money
's and of all
, six hundred dollars
this time you start
and work garden
what do you do ?
that is interesting .
are so at this time of the year
we have a lot of
, but do n't know
have up on the farm and that
do a big garden , always .
i love to work , outside really --
i flowers and stuff
this exact in my life
all the lawn care
take care of the flower beds and things like that , but still
was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me , and
that 's terrible .
feel really , and
so , they are all
everyone who live in town , and has yards practically has
and our lawns with that do so stay pretty nice all summer , if you water .
turn in the winter and it
think and just
.
those two
keeping it going in
they have to water an incredible amount .
but those lawns , look nice during the winter
almost stick but like a pretty thumb out .
and they grow rocks just
that is .
as long as you can have some grass there .
we were taking care of lawns out there , and
that particular year they had just tons of rain , and
a lot of disease problems and then know .
that 's true .
you able to get a double sometimes crops of certain things in your garden
people
do n't have a vegetable garden ,
have never , actually here ,
but ,
that is one of my old favorites .
'll ignore just so it
now , like thirty did
nine my daughter says
we like .
that is one of my favorites .
you and ?
little bit younger than
but
like and
it is
it 's a good show .
all of our kids
but that 's
, like
that 's a good show , too .
very good
did n't
it 's a good episode .
the new character on there did .
there is what time it ?
it is twenty to nine minutes .
's twenty minutes to six here
three hours difference .
what else do you like ?
see 's
a lot of different shows
see 's
like murder , she
watched ever in my entire life that never
a small bowling will be plenty .
is that mine .
will a small bowling
talking to my daughter .
all my children ,
that for about twelve years
watched for more than probably that it
something .
so that was a long time ago .
she was my favorite character on there .
because they could n't settle a contract , was
if they 're going to her to do that wo n't watch it
that 's great .
like all my children
do n't know
the people on
like
they 'd bring some of the old characters back
tad is going to come back , i bet ,
do you think ?
is sure he will
he 'll come back , show up at the right just moment .
cliff 's on
he is .
so he is out for good .
he is out for good .
they did
that 's how they left the show , but not in real life .
and she is happily
and that 's the reason she left the show .
she wanted a private life
maybe twice a month
so do n't
i watching
i play lots of tennis
, and are gone a lot
do n't get watch , so
, religiously
have to miss it
used to be like that
is that way about a lot of different shows
there are two new characters on there .
do n't know if you known
like show
do n't like her on it ,
have never
know which one she is just
never either .
who life goes on comes on
always .
who murder , she wrote , comes on
so , and
that well real
be sure to watch it tomorrow night
known
the kids , already know who is it
do n't know , though , who is it
who 's it ?
ask them .
started
think so .
an interesting topic since
for what did you have
, is an officer in the air force
that is interesting .
our topic is so food today ,
if you are having a dinner party , what would you serve ?
do you want to go first me ?
have a dinner party
let
some rolls and some rice or something like maybe .
do
is when the party here ?
that would take some planning
do n't know
it 's not a question of capability to do something like that here .
it 's just there is no motivation .
that 's right .
that sounds too good .
have three kids
just pizza and usually have very plain kind of not very interesting meals .
once it is so in kind of fun ,
but it 's not a regular thing .
for about five minutes
they shooting for here
's
live on a lake here
that 's a little more a casual thing .
do a , really good place
that sounds
tried really a whole lot
, but do n't know
's see
did have a dinner party
did n't know this was from all over the whole country
.
it is .
and is originally from long island
.
.
from around there
and be all over the place .
that is interesting .
's see
a dinner party
different kinds of foods and new recipes
somebody , and sometimes will
the recipe from
they have some delicious , delicious things ,
them and boil
breasts four
until them and boil
maybe thirty minutes
what ?
do you want to start ?
it does n't matter .
we are discussing the capital punishment .
you right
, should have
capital punishment pro except the way it is done
,
by the rest of their lives us
.
capital punishment is necessary in many cases
it 's not a deterrent ,
our jails or would not be so full .
there would n't be so many people in death row .
something not gruesome but something more where people know it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people .
if you committed a certain crime , you were going to receive a death penalty
and it was going to happen to you .
no stays of execution
no loopholes ,
and do n't even know if that would help really
notoriety .
double the reason
also the fact of notoriety and
they became known well .
a big
their chances of receiving the death penalty actually minimal
they know they will probably be out in ten to twelve years .
they going to write a book
they going to go on talk shows
that are rather than a reward for a heinous crime .
that 's for sure .
there are exceptions to the ruling
but do n't like to see that
the sense never that person will do again
they will .
he ca n't do it again , if not .
that is correct ,
the death penalty , and it be executed
the death penalty
the chances not great that that will happen
but there 's a greater chance that he 'll be back out on the streets in twelve years .
is looking at also beyond that even
thinking about it
and do n't have a definite opinion
the more mild ones but more severe especially on armed robbery and stuff ones
that 's right .
for just too pleasure
look at something like that
they , too , remain on this earth
out on the streets
the death penalty for capital crimes
under our system
china and a few other countries have little a different view of that .
with dope there
there is no appeals .
would invade every day your privacy
look through my in my bedroom things .
that 's right .
that 's an invasion of privacy really .
it very annoying when
that does in your part of the country happen ?
come home
.
get a few things done
ca n't the telephone and
could put a stop to it ,
but do n't know what to do to stop it
a sign on
they would think it did n't mean them , i guess .
guess not
everybody but me .
do you live at home with your parents ?
by other members of the family
.
what can you do to stop that ?
do n't know
are used to it now ,
but sometimes it sort of get
there is much , but not .
with it , i guess
do n't know
you do have brothers ?
,
but they do n't live at home .
had younger two brothers ,
me to telephone conversations
do that , though ,
would pick up the phone and listen to theirs
would get in the bathroom and lock so they could n't hear me , maybe the door
and then they would go get on the other extension
could hear them , and
but could n't get them to hang up
a long time ago , but
and they still do it to me .
you 're on a conversation instead
this lady do at work to me that when
are doing something wrong ,
and she started just
and , she is nice
but it gets
see 's
'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors
do n't have that many people coming
, but we 'll have not as many as the phone calls here or there
really the thing is that
our in our neighborhood kids , used to bother me
but they 've got now grown up all
there is not
especially when you 're in a hurry .
do you have a lot of traffic in your area ?
it can get busy ,
it 's real , real bad here , some days
you would like to feel like it 's an invasion of privacy because you ca n't even ride all the way around you down the road without people , and .
quiet a bit
it 's pretty busy .
it 's really ,
it 's really .
right on a main thoroughfare
an invasion of privacy
hear a lot of noise , especially when at night
or would every time a fire truck and up
do n't even hear it anymore
.
out just close , i guess , and
before it bothered me
, though , is a real solid sleeper
so that probably would n't bother me .
'd sleep right through it
you out , i guess
it takes a lot .
's see
is an invasion
was mad because those was mine ,
name all over them
it was a letter from a girlfriend of mine .
because those was mine ,
me look through my things , and not trust me
was mad about that and my privacy there
have you
is a student
watching , actually than being able to go out to see
have n't seen either one of those
the shows that
's see
is trying to just think
recently over
catching me at
what have you recently seen ?
what did you think of that one ?
quite a bit
to be a little one
and that 's when the movie , was filmed
when the movie came out , and we went ,
my dad got a little plane
it was
or they 'd start recognizing people .
because my attention would get diverted every time they 'd say that did in the movie theater
go which one
scope .
thought it was a good film , but
you but
it was
it was ,
was watching wild wild west last night in fact
but it was an interesting movie .
have seen you pretty woman ?
thought that was a good show
that was a good movie .
it was just movie .
kind of
it did n't
and it was n't really a comedy ,
but it was an enjoyable movie .
, do n't know
sure did have
but
you going to see this one who are coming out next
have you seen the rest ?
have
is not sure ,
think , but
they showed and all five in a row .
they have it everywhere ,
every major city had theater one who did it
they did it everywhere .
and it was really good to see
but you can
it is
so much with the public schools as much as
that might be a lot to do with it .
is not sure where you 're from
problems with our educational system , a lot of it is due to money .
we do n't have
things we just ca n't afford
is it
it is .
got computers now that
there is just so much more
that 's true .
do with too salaries , a lot of it speaking of money
cause if you ca n't pay the right people are not going to get the people who can do a good job .
schools to discipline expect the kids
think it should go right back and
the same way
a lot do with how the kids was raised at home
they try to take away and then when a lot of things that they can do the kids to discipline .
they have
and probably they could lose their job
lose their job , and big lawsuits and all that
that 's got a lot to do with it
do n't have much on to say
was our governor that just got thrown out of office
but he was n't .
and a lot of his problems have mostly to do with money .
it is , if you have more money
and , unfortunately , there is not many places to get that money .
one of my physics professors at college
the teachers at
they are teachers .
a lot about
and then had some social studies
they teach social studies
and they do n't know a lot about that .
my professor was a professor physics
a lot of
of view a physicist
and that cause a lot of trouble .
, do n't know
and kind of decide on where the money 's best spent
different districts like to have fancy nice schools
a little more concerned with paying the right people
went to high school ,
one of the high schools
it kind of and so would make you think that we 'd be better off if all the schools was blown away by tornadoes and we have to rebuild them all
we did n't have a very rich community
was very old and
as as far , and it is still there
have
have but never
and do n't foresee them because they ca n't afford it building a new one for a long time
kind of
worked on a golf course at one time
picked up golf
and do n't know
just kind of
it is sure .
i play at least three times a week
is on it ,
got to play , though ,
is trying to get back
so got to start all over again
it 's not like riding a bicycle .
you do
is one of those rare left-handed golfers
and do
what 's your handicap ?
it is three right now .
or about
twenty up to now probably if
though , if you can get it back right down .
try and get out there
our long winters
just because it is
we usually can play year around here .
but there are two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play , usually
are pretty much addicted , and
out there
though it 's a good game .
it is
because the reason is so and much .
that 's the way i look at it .
a lot of groups
score between themselves
but really do n't care
go out
is going to try
and then see
improve each day
is not very well driving
or are not very well hitting long irons
putting well not
it all but sometimes come together .
known
one of the two
or something would go wrong
managed but always
and went to that
this is a big golf area .
long to get on the course
as a matter of fact .
it 's only been in the last five years that way .
a timing tee advance two days
just moved into this small community
so is going to try and get into one of the golf courses here
was from the twin cities area ,
is too some cold golf
you guys having the bad weather
we have
is that all we have
something is coming now through
leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties
but we do n't get any snow anymore .
do n't know what changed that pattern
we used to get four or five inches a year .
now we get .
.
at least that does n't get in the way of golfing
play in the snow before golf
to get out my orange golf ball and go out .
that is here sometimes
they will take out there
always have been interested in kind of , space and stuff
you following the progress of the space health code
to a degree
as much as
just have been so busy ,
a chance to read a newspaper now and then
and
travel space in
would n't even
right now or
for that getting
they , that maybe age or even physical abilities may not be a barrier
.
that little space program and was one of the big backers of that .
it 's amazing ,
it 's hard to imagine who life was like without it now .
have seen before him
what would we do without it ?
we were talking about just that the other day .
back then what did we do ?
a lot of
concentrated foods for one
do n't know
that 's right .
that 's right .
just on going
that 's true .
who what do you
hit a brick wall , eventually
it 's hard
that is something that would be hard to think about .
.
but
see them do more in
think it 's in people 's nature to be the first to do something
me too
mind not so much being first
everyone 's nature to
is our curiosity
of course .
that 's true .
there must be better some way of doing this .
a better place be
you looking for something better
that 's true .
at work people
's always looking for something better
a better way of
that 's right .
that 's right .
things and then you must lead a pretty dull life
they finding easier ways
you really do n't think about it too much
you finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
it 's a thing subconscious .
somewhere they can sit down and write what things down
you probably would n't have a pretty good list .
but you just do n't think about them .
and that 's true .
we doing things better
do n't know what to do about the federal budget
certainly have been ideas
that area and on you have .
we 're talking in trillions of dollars .
and have no concept of what that number means
the elected people
about others
the elected people
what that are or how a budget even
you would
them have a degree in economics
you would so trust the decision making economists ?
called the dismal science
the value of a dollar but
the , lobbyists need them .
they do n't make pragmatic decisions .
constituency instead of
you would so favor a law said .
would definitely
of them
you think the lobbyists would be good for
should any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund
a one-on-one relationship with the people make
that is , as far as a conflict of interest .
you talking again billions and trillions of dollars
that ,
talk so
you would be against any deficit spending ?
you going to have to have a generation that 's going to bite the bullet in line to bring it really
you ca n't ease into it .
it took years and years to build up .
forget the figures on the interest rate
a dollars in interest
part of the problem is
we buy from intimate international banking .
that 's why we have interest .
really and so out of control that we do n't want to put the brakes on them
but what one practical steps could take ?
that 's reasonable by having a budget .
but everybody will say he 's for that .
how you will make that actually happen , , and ?
of course .
on to it
you take the gross national income
number of percent of this gross national income
one thing we could do is to give a percent ten income tax .
everyone , no matter what pay a percent ten income tax .
a good idea
no .
that 's right .
no deductions .
just percent .
a percent ten income tax
is that
and is that it .
that is so it .
with that
that 's a good idea
to raise the total revenues
or it would n't
who 's your favorite team ?
bet .
i kind of back so when
that 's pretty nice .
that 's good .
that 's right .
about how your favorite team ?
never score and
out their opponents
just enough points
me that and .
and have been keeping up with the saints a lot
,
this year a lot
just a team fun to watch
did n't
it was funny .
a fireworks they
dome and up in the roof caught on fire .
so , they have
falling out of the roof big those piece of something came
there are so big this on the field fire
ca n't believe that
you ca n't really just tell what 's going to happen .
is that
known
about two weeks ago was watching the saints
and it was
he 's tough ,
he has an incredible leg .
he is .
do you think they are going to be able to make this year , past the playoff first game it ?
so sure i hope
not sure
got teams four
who 's that ?
the saints and .
they lose their only time .
and if he is on a good night .
he is definitely
really .
that 's right .
who did they play ?
that 's right ,
they won , in overtime .
that 's right .
now .
watched that game
do you have a favorite between those two ?
root against them
that 's true .
say
is that
just kind of they
i
that 's the way ,
never have been a big saints fan until the last year or two
and they 've actually started doing something .
paid attention to them
teams that they are thinking
paid too much attention to that
they looking at
and there is some other city .
's , but not sure
think
so think ?
i think
they 've got a football team
think it might be them , but
that would be fun .
some more teams get in
would , definitely
they supposed to put in by either next year or the year after two
you guys do up
that 's a long time .
was in the air force
so what is it be like up there
it is for the past week or two
before that , for most of the year , but it 's been hot and dry
it been strange here this year
course this whole year been a different in ways more than one year
always , they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever ,
we have all this rain , and
and it 's not a bad summer at all , really
cool really
pouring just down
that kind of deal ,
if you have early it .
but it is usually not until later .
it 's really strange .
but we really need the rain that we 've been getting ,
today it and not
the last few days it 's been but most of the day .
is it
.
any problems of it
's , certainly occurred at
but
of any particular problems
will be a little bit more typical autumn weather
but it 's really strange .
we really have an autumn
it 's like we went into winter
what the poor trees , said ,
we have long summer lasting
then it became winter
it to be today to sort of change .
, and was up last weekend there
trees , still have on their leaves and
and they 're green ,
but they 're dead .
the freeze just got them .
they were n't apparently ready for it at all ,
we have a typical fall at all
color not much changes
really weird this year
is not sure what that means
do n't know
now the
think it was an especially good for colors fall winter
all you actually have so
it in kind of
we did , for a time .
it is beautiful up there is n't it usually ?
gorgeous .
and look
it is almost identical kind of country .
beautiful .
this year for for the leaves the trees
little oak tree that was
that 's because it ca n't tolerate a freeze this early .
is that right ?
if it would come later it would be all right ?
the white oaks
their leaves green still
are and
they got bit on the ends of the
but they look still pretty good .
just on the tree .
it often are not
you do very much follow football ?
is
what ?
you do very much follow football ?
n't
recently have n't
we can talk about something else .
?
, is not
i guess kids out
what is that ?
kids out
are
is
got two boys
you like football do ?
the cowboys
but that 's about it .
the
been for a long time
but have n't been recently to any games
catch every weekend that the game
had 's game ?
, have n't
it 's pretty nice .
we decided to watch just them at home .
that 's good .
a little bit the game
is not
and do what like some guys
, like to watch
hopefully and .
that 's about the extent of it .
right now is in college ,
is more into college
.
what school
.
.
you planning to go into
have n't
a lot about labor and delivery
but do n't know
try that
that 's what my mom do , labor and delivery .
she love it .
but she 's been working .
the graveyard 's what you 'd call it
she works the graveyard shift .
and she is
going on twenty years now
and she really enjoy it .
that you 've at that time of the night
and just , she started a new job at a different hospital , closer to where she lives
and she is really enjoying herself .
she really like it .
that 's great .
good luck to you
you 'll hope like it .
but , my family , are there
'd like to go back
large down there
so that 'd be the place to do it .
like to you good luck , said
take care
maybe we 'll and meet again up some time .
do you want to start
or should start ?
go right ahead
a very typical home for
we have children three ,
in a lot of the sports , soccer and baseball
and my little girl , goes to tap dance
and my little one goes to
's home with the children , and
a lot of running around just do .
it seems like a lot of a similar life type of my neighbors kind have .
about
is
it 's pretty typical of the other town in the area homes and
we have a lot of homes town here as well as single family homes ,
and it was just a much better for me personally arrangement at .
is not a lot home
travel a great deal with my job
so it was easier to have that somebody else looks for the maintenance out a home .
was sort of maintenance free .
and the beds flower
and it 's a lot of work .
it 's certainly .
have a town home , with having not all that responsibility
good and thick because if they are not
was shopping for one ,
could n't hear my neighbors
once you 're inside , you do n't know you 're in a town home
that sound .
it is .
you do n't actually so next door to you hear anybody .
then there 's probably in your area so a lot of people who have those homes type career type
.
young families with kids
they are still doing a lot of building in the neighborhood .
seem to move from all over the country , where we are from the northeast , so
or also do n't have any family around
a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors
there
how pretty .
it 's nice .
do miss that
and it is
we have definitely a lot of trees here .
a lot of leaves
is that
do n't
this is the time of year we are starting to lose , and
they are now all falling .
that 's right ,
that 's right ,
.
get outside with other the kids neighbor
we have not much in a few trees
just a little
that kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks
about it , then they 'd just blow probably the leaves away , if you did n't to do anything
it 's not too bad .
for a certain amount of time
do n't think so
it was
it was to speak with you too good .
thank you ,
too you
in a big category , takes
your dollar or goes far
.
it was on a talk show ,
they took the parents and then the son ,
more in time when the father was a little bit younger
and they compared to the 's son , that he was making now .
was he actually and even though the son was up more successful in the management ladder probably higher
is it and
is making more money now ,
but my dollar went a lot farther .
that 's true .
buying candy and stuff was a lot less expensive than it is now
and he could see .
and it is now over a buck .
do n't know what it 's by you
.
this is my second only phone call
so are waiting for mine
this will be pretty soon towards my last one ,
so they 'll stop me
are pretty much out to the things to say , but
like social changes
and do n't think this , would have
but clothing and styles , lot of those changed .
it 's a broad category ,
attitudes even on clothing and stuff
towards
know many years ago
was it hard for me at first ,
of a lot of the bright colors but now .
, used to be more conservative and just your basic colors
all the time , though but .
it 's just ridiculous ,
and
and even clothing from the sixties come back .
a lot of girls wearing sixties clothes
one of the nice things
do n't
on one of the past styles
and they come back again
so if they 'll be in style in a few years back .
that 's true ,
maybe some day
, probably wo n't
but prices might go down more lot .
, do n't know , though ,
does n't look good
think that 's the only style i hope does n't come back bottoms bell
,
.
did n't care for them either really
that is n't a false or right or wrong true test here .
but unfortunately they are not .
my dad , was
that 's all right .
how do you expect them to do this year ?
they did pretty well .
what did you think of the world series ?
'll tell you
kind of
we have only two radio stations ,
and the other one was country .
you did n't really have a lot of choice
so , that is right .
or country
but it certainly was
it was sure ,
it was sure .
what do you think ?
would like to assume that they 're going to do ,
or we can predict ?
was
was able to go to my first game baseball
this is incredible .
rather or they adopted me
and it was just exciting ,
and they hit the long ball ,
ball and that look .
not all but really is far that when
and it 's so much more exciting watching a ball that came at you ,
is
that 's right ,
that 's right .
is a great sports enthusiast ,
baseball teams
he was put in the restaurant hall of fame .
and he says he is coming back ,
he does n't many years
he 'll be at least one more ,
, might be two and three
he likes it .
that 's right
is he still and
that 's right .
a kick out of it
he is such a nice man .
management .
but he is certainly for the kids a good example .
that 's right .
you like to have someone like that you could point to say
that 's right .
their sons and now .
he 's been a legend for so many years ,
and do n't know ,
was n't
think it was a little early part of the summer ,
is that
a game is a game .
think is the worst culprit for air pollution ?
think it 's probably a combination of things
to acid rain
and think that probably is hurting us a little bit
we are backing off from that a little bit hopefully ,
have n't
but it 's really bad on the environment .
missed that one
automobiles of course
with our love affair
kind of hard to do anything about that , i guess
, known
moved out of there
you meet the pollution standards
we have too that here
but it is part of the sticker inspection ,
in your exhausted pipe a probe
and so that 's the way they are dealing with it here .
that was just mainly in the cities there ,
do n't have to do that ,
would put in a lot of money
it probably 'd be difficult anyway .
was just reading an article in mother earth news magazine
a lot of places
a lot of people
've got a place in the country
they have up those
it 's a catalytic converter ,
it 's a plate that fits into the smoking pipe
feeds itself and apparently
the higher it after you get the more complete the combustion 's .
it and sound .
, have n't seen
that might help , especially in some places a little bit .
we 're really lucky here .
,
it come back .
really think we 're doing some important things
, education raising consciousness awareness
i work for the school here ,
this is one of the big things with kids and .
kids writing letters to the newspapers telling adults to clean up their act
hope we 're not too late with it
we are having all kinds of recycling .
that 's a big thing , too .
, it had nothing to do with air pollution
thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence so
so you went to what college ?
did in you
in major or what what year ?
major .
international business
and you ?
's and
that sounds interesting .
that of a program is how long ?
forever .
seems like
it 's about five years ,
was already in school ,
a study
it took me five years .
you get so
you change , and
pick up
's management , you
it was only three classes more ,
that you get out in four years
what 's your advice to picking a college .
my advice is , look at the student to faculty ratio ,
that 's great .
it is interesting ,
what is always is that there was time to talk ,
and they knew you .
you was n't just in their class ,
you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time , and so
or or if you ran them about a problem .
they 're always willing to help you out .
in high school ?
it was a class lecture biology
and it was n't just
you are sitting there ,
and you are taking notes
and , it was n't just
you 'd pass the teacher in high school
-- even in high school you could say high to your teachers , unless you 're in that biology class and
they do know you
or should know you ?
the classes pretty big
so , it 's hard to get individual help .
it on , you 're .
very little ,
right now is in a class chemistry for example
there are tons of students in it , and
and he has only office certain hours ,
and so there are certain times you can talk , only
and you could get there
and still did n't you
a child of
think your advice is good
's see
my advice would
that are excellent advice .
, did n't
, did n't need to
and do n't know ,
that 's not always and bad ,
, do n't know
it is frustrating , i guess .
it does get it .
is going to get done never
was taking summer classes
here of
but
that 's good advice .
even if you might want ,
you do n't want management ,
think , but
many credit cards
is down to one
was that way
had more than you experience
were pulling your leg
how do you use your credit card ?
just keep it in reserve ,
'd like to try and use
and and then to pay off
that 's my ideal way .
how do you use it ?
emergencies come along ,
and use it
that is understandable ,
my car , has a major problem
seven hundred dollars
and just things come up
get to use the way you 'd really like it
quite a few credit cards more than
use , and
i pay and that monthly , off
do have them up a little bit there ,
try to use them too often , not
it 's a very expensive area .
so sometimes , if you need buy something you have no choice other .
was up in there ,
where it was in trouble getting me
, paid off them and got out of it
that was good that you have the opportunity to do that .
, that use both you , you and your wife ,
cash for as much as we can there
and have for automotive purposes that
that 's great .
use credit cards like they are going out of business to be honest with you here
just basically get yourself in trouble with those
.
that i use
so i use
use only for business ,
have the money to pay off it automatically so
you start out at a low limit ,
they just keep and then
if , and then that 's fine ,
forget it ,
do n't want that
the temptation is too great .
, so do n't know
just writing checks is just as easy i guess .
that 's true ,
that 's true ,
we 've kind of this exhausted topic
you ca n't really say too much about it .
other than , you use or you do n't use them .
they do n't care if we
that is coming up ,
then , maybe , and we 'll talk again .
too
then .
.
what kind of car would you like to buy next ?
is that kind of everybody 's dream
why that would be ?
it 's a general motors product ,
like general motors because they is made in the united states ,
we have real good luck with them
that 's good .
if you have no financial requirements , if you could buy any car in the entire world , no matter what it cost , what would buy you ?
do you ?
do n't know
that 's a sharp looking car .
that 's really .
it been though
they have been .
never really .
is that it had always it 's own unique look
have always
that looks sharp
that looks
think they are very pretty
think and
's , but
a nice comfortable just ride
,
they are
they are
like you would in a small one
now they 've got a unique feature in them now .
if you have a end accident at a rate of speed such front , the engine will actually .
it 'll go underneath the car instead .
did n't know that
a big factor safety
they have all the balloons
the air bags ,
the air bags ,
that 's great ,
that 's great ,
you say you 've always have preferred general motors products .
.
in the united states rather than foreign countries
help our economy
have what kind of general motors cars
nice real cars
that 's what we have now ,
we have driven them for about probably twenty years .
see 's
do n't know
but it 's a very good car .
not it is
that 's great
that 's great .
you just do n't want any hassles with it .
you expect it to do its job ,
that and into consideration do n't take a lot of car manufacturers
that 's true .
they expect to buy their product you just ,
, is how reliable is this car going to be
prices , is an issue
but it is not the most important issue .
because you can get financing five year on them now it is n't really
would go with the general motors any time , but
but that 's all right .
so everybody has a truck
just never have problems with them
my truck would , over on me
good products
see 's
gone down , despite tax cuts in recent years , our total tax burden
among industrialized nations but we have
of the matter ,
you pay for
if , it 's going to involve more taxes necessarily .
been energy taxes , particularly good for the economy , that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes
i kind of have mixed feelings
always there
and out of each check pay
wonder and you
where it 's going all ?
we have such a national huge deficit , and
if it is doing a whole lot of good
there 's a lot of social programs out there who need help
you kind of wonder always but
is a lot in this year
but that 's a particularly regressive tax ,
it 's a tax on the first dollar earnings ,
is
with that
known
know that the tax are there , and
other major countries and .
of to government grave services cradle have
they are real trade-offs there .
and and
really do n't have to do with taxes but just money in general , this
a scary thing that
taken care of in private most pension plans
that 's true .
are up there
and you picked this topic ,
just kind of
did n't pick it
you did n't .
do n't really
, may have filled out on the form
you did .
have n't
did they assign automatically the topic ?
a call topic are given
did n't know that
choose what topic
received some just
you should try it .
did n't realize that
a rather controversial on what you are subject
many of the subjects
of the defense budget the
first me go
is in a university of gymnastics and then ,
it is
day or mother 's pick the right day care
you can
with their program that kind of stuff
we do n't have any children ,
but we 're going to have one next year .
looking at maybe
are working now part time ,
'll be doing that or what we 're going to do
home
is going to need to find , but then if
our church last year , and had a mother 's day out program they started
a lot of people at the church
so would feel very confident with leaving my child there
a very good place
the mother 's day out programs ,
the churches always have a pretty good program , and
pretty early , because a lot of places have very long waiting lists
if the teachers have their master 's degree in education and child development child
what kind of a structure is it going to be .
time .
let them if they kind and of sleep ,
and the teacher stay with the sleeping ones ,
the other ones to get up
so many bad things about
that 's true .
it 's such a growing concern ,
you do n't hear good things
when the child 's a lot younger before three years old , the church 's a good program and sometimes
sometimes you consider having a private person who came to your own home when they are real little or something like that , and even
another consideration is what is the ratio of teachers to children and
children to
that makes , a difference
just your child ,
you , your child would want to have their own sheets all the time , and not have another use child that bed maybe
is sure that whatever you decide , you 'll be happy with
and it is exciting time to have a new one .
we 're
i bet
is that
but we have been thinking about that ,
a little ways off in
how old they can be before you can bring them in
.
some places take them , even as infants like eight weeks .
there is a place to look into ,
take care of infants and then to two years old nurses used to work in the hospital up only
just in little just real ones
the older children and then .
but , it 's a difficult situation .
exercise kind of
, aerobics two days a week to
have three kids at home , but also
me pretty busy
that keeps you .
that gives me plenty of exercise ,
with the family a
me
that 's fine .
yourself and
almost every morning
with the change weather have
but it 's about a minute thirty exercise every morning .
every morning
that 's fantastic exercise .
he does it every day like a ritual .
he has a meeting business
but he goes every day ,
he is a runner and then , too .
he run three mornings a week
and he does his deal ,
he does n't , and some days
but then maybe he 'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run .
'd get a bicycle rather ,
, but did n't seem to use it enough ,
somebody sold it , so in
'd like to get a bike
the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here ,
it just to keep the off pounds and .
we 're getting up in age in our thirties late
it keep going ,
and it just get worse .
you want to eat , still
known
on some program like that
two this aerobics mornings class a week to
and take my year three old with me
there is a nursery there .
it out for her to have little friends and is kind of another day ,
but can not
is so tough
it is .
somebody 's planning for you , and they
we sometimes take the easy way .
that 's true ,
that 's true .
for called
for participating
thank you .
you thinking of buying next
it and .
really do you ?
what year is it ?
one problem with
and there 's no reason for it
fix or repair daily or .
go there .
three times like two out
it would have been thousand two .
she like those .
nice cars
consider when you buy a car ?
the gas mileage for one thing ,
have always stick shift
it be automatic
.
driving anyway
and all the time that traffic high areas
and nine to five or eight to five and you 're in when
that makes
been
the driver 's air bag
like
really .
, like
but could n't afford the insurance on one of those
we found a real good interest rate , and
they really come down on their prices when
looked at we and around ,
and we could n't really
we ended up with a four and a half percent interest rate on a new car brand , and the payments and
is that
a buyer time 's first
and they 're charging me unreasonable interest ,
have got eight more payments , but
's and
that 's great .
it 's a good car
that
when was our kids younger we really wanted a two door .
got so in our papers on our first car , off the car , all we had to do is show them
and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it .
so we got a four door this time ,
i sort of went and more for the comfort factor ,
liked the smaller cars , and
, but is a bigger person
really comfort driving along the road and stuff and .
another big factor of mine
going to be a four door too
and you buy groceries and stuff like that .
my push number .
a spectator or ?
i play
actually do n't play golf , but
is the same way
hit the ball
it all over the place ?
we 've got tons up here
but do n't know
how do you feel about your game ?
that 's a good question
goes a lot golfing
every now and then out
n't really even have a game and
that too
do n't know
try to play ,
played two , three times a week
best ever got
and the big breaking was going to come
got worse again and then
are pretty bad
great distance hitting it across
but is getting better
can now hit in the air some of the time it
that 's pretty good .
is so kind of a novice at it
is that and worse
take it kind of actually seriously
have been doing so bad , but
is starting over from scratch
is going to go take lessons and everything
actually can play or not this game
is to get some kind of lessons or something
because my tee off , is not bad
's good up to everything else putting and stuff like that
it 's just , that initial tee .
when you 're put
that 's a good thing .
could actually learn
is that
finally get
are doing all fine
the and .
see how it is going to break
you can see , though , it really ?
what about the speed ?
if you can really .
but can you tell how fast you 're going to hit it ?
it is
when it 's going up a hill because it 's going to break in a direction .
but can you feel that ?
do n't know
can get it within four or five feet or something
but do n't have enough field
you die every time at the hole
it just die in .
, do n't know
it 's hard for me .
it is
is fine , once
me to get to the hole
's once you there , you 're all .
are all set
we should play golf team then .
'll get us there
and you put in .
that sounds good to me .
and get there two
and there me it takes five me get and five get in it .
it usually takes me about two or three there to get it probably
is that according to the hole and then
it is .
that 's good .
the friends i play with they but
and they 're really good .
they are pretty good
that 's pretty good .
that 's pretty good .
is talking to the wrong guy
that 's not my golf .
that 's my friends .
so are not good
are usually around a hundred
that 's my thing .
on this hole do
but it is n't going to happen .
and
with every single time a good thing
that 's good .
is
this service and that service or the other thing
those canned messages
my sense is just something may have been done about it by congressmen
just what went into the
i guess not let you in .
having some kind of
from calling for business selling you things
is sure that 's true
some of did too .
think government can do that now ,
is that right ?
and especially with possibly around children .
that could be useful protection .
and do n't have children around
but just do n't like those numbers hundred nine
have so
but it does not
what dialing services
they sell you things
people just call
those problems and then
used a credit card they 'd want to have my phone number
and did not like giving it out
gave out my number working
asking for a phone number
and you buy anything
and do n't think they are going to call me and ask me how it is functioning ,
and do n't give out that
have an unlisted number
n't so
that is one solution
often people calling you but ?
are your number
and you 've actually your number
anything that you buy you may get put on a , preferred list that are purchased .
and companies can purchase this list
and is what is that
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers .
a phony phone number
some of that is , unfortunately , legal .
so they ca n't
and that 's what it falls under .
the guise of
do n't care for it , so
but it a legal solution for some companies are .
is so that
do n't know
think it 's gotten much worse , the last , few years
have gotten on more lists
the telephone is not only the invasion of privacy .
you 've got the holy rollers
to the right path to either direct you
so it 's not just the telephone .
sell you magazines .
this time they get
have been trying all different times , but
but do n't get anybody at five thirty , do n't get anybody at nine at night
's , working at
happened to walk back and just
gone for
to school
's home certain days , so
have n't been making any phone calls
have n't
just .
you have
have n't
the first time we were on this it came just about every day .
never had to make one
they came just always .
of it or something
are we
what do you think ?
never gave it any thought myself
were hoping that you could tell me
do n't have any objection to people doing that
think it might be good for them
might , but as a mother of two daughters
concerned about their safety just
and could n't help but wait worried if
that would be my main objection .
do n't know
maybe it should stay on a voluntary basis
it will probably never happen
think that it would be good for everyone to do something like that
do n't
it probably wo n't .
do n't even know how we 'd pay for it anyway
we ca n't seem to pay for all the little things we have now going .
that is another consideration .
but do n't know
some kids
it might be a real opener eye .
of town here the other
some modest frame wood really tiny homes
of town that
lived in one of those probably when
that would be an eye opener , would n't it ?
would n't
it is .
known
going across all the world
known
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country .
what do know , but
but how did you get on this program ?
just went by that place
to a football game playoff ago which we lost a week or so
and we went by .
the first time
it looked nice really .
a lot of trees there
it looked like a sight .
hang on
, do n't think so
is back
but how did you get on it ?
but , he work over there
we did it last time .
this time
, do n't know
they did n't even ask him back .
, that was n't it
said any calls this time but
do n't get too many
and can never find anybody
used to get calls from too far away
have the same experiences
all right around here
, do n't know
there are so many with this one town .
even in some families .
my husband 's from new jersey
what his sisters does one of things
and that is one family ?
everybody in new jersey
.
you know , how that goes .
she told us to cut off yet
so end your conversation .
any more words of
n't sure
you send here over
no kids .
is one of them
she might .
'd be more suited to that than her
she is just bugs ,
think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight
which is movies ,
correct ?
that is correct .
do n't like going to see them in the theaters
most all of
seen recently that
, do n't know
we were actually tonight earlier watching to live and in a l die .
have you that movie seen ?
have n't
living alone .
it 's not too bad .
.
have n't yet
this weekend saw it
and it is to me an outstanding movie .
thoroughly enjoyed it
he is an attorney
his daughter and is an attorney
and she had a suit against his company .
it is one of those things .
it is
though he 's a good actor .
he is .
we saw the other night just too actually her .
you did ?
it is one of our favorite movies .
with a roommate and my girlfriend .
we 've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months .
watched six or eight times
get through with that movie
again time and time
, too , .
in what
is an electrical engineering
everything is going there up all right ?
it 's only about half an hour .
live on the border .
that is that bad then .
that 's right .
that makes a lot of sense .
of that part of the country a
southern town , it seems ,
right in the corner
live on little that spot ten mile .
sounds
you did have with hurricanes damage this year ?
where
and we got the backlash of that thing .
waves high come in there ,
it was an quite experience and
to seeing now
the movie doors , that is so out .
have you seen green card ?
that would be pretty good .
have n't seen one that
that 's a real warm movie .
it turned out just nicely really .
that if you have a chance
is in for it
a lot of movies
and we say what movies should we rent
and we do n't know .
can get green card
we 'll try that one .
have one ?
did
and do n't know
with some of the people in that movie because
too you
is looking forward to it
the way ,
'll go ahead and start
suit , but coat or .
a year ago , jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group changed .
it 's a different set of standards
the same almost every day
it 's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat much .
but , it was very different before .
how do you dress ?
wear blue jeans and tennis shoes just so
sweatshirt today and have on
and that 's pretty much for me the norm .
in a dress come in
i
doing in a dress
and it is usually .
ran out of jeans
,
that 's funny .
so , it does change ?
your dress ,
you do have things like presentations to do or anything like that ?
would have to put on a suit
and come in
but that 's
,
i
have to go to a meeting with him business once a month ,
that is interesting .
see 's
what else about this
and .
dress that in the jeans
there is that middle thing and then .
there is much , but not
of the road
it 's nice there is not a requirement for it .
sometimes think there should be
once in
and they have no the deal shorts ,
i guess is one of the things
that 's right ,
that 's right .
is not sure even
have seen too , but
this was n't necessarily a big conversation , so
think we did it , but
,
work in the north building and .
thank you .
thank you .
this is a real first .
you at work
.
get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening
, and are not having any luck
of the afternoon the
are happy we got through
, too
any opinion on
are interested with what 's happening in the soviet union , especially
democracy .
a little of the news
of days that the last
you do know ?
or anything , a population
is really uninformed
do n't have
it 's not a tiny area .
but it 's more significant , in the sense of , it is a great agricultural region .
,
really did n't know
they are now completely out .
thought they were
it 's very important for the economics of the soviet union .
was so really probably
they ca n't fight
n't
are it
did n't read
do n't know , anymore
wonder how they 're going to get through the winter
sounds to me like they 'll start rioting soon that that would do any good , not
when they are desperate that people
that 's true ,
here for
that 's true ,
the war riots , of course , and
to get n't
you have some problems
.
we have lots and lots of layoffs here .
and it 's pretty scary .
do n't understand that well economics
, do n't know
we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and other countries n't put
assume that have a great effect and so
the poor , got poorer
the statistics prove
or is it just coincidence it was during this period ?
really do n't know
think maybe they contributed to it
somebody in china can make and we have to make for dollars ten because we 've unions
is that
child and labor .
do n't know
our horrible situation
do n't think there 's any one simple answer to the whole thing
one thing .
is that
have read is a theory
going
say
go straight back into my original democratic party
, known
it , used to
of i kind and for
but it is now looking better .
your governor
do you ?
is glad to hear that
she is an impressive woman .
too think so .
and hope she do well
than she is here , although she did manage to win
was she
he shot so many times in the foot himself .
some of the people
ask , do you
very little , unfortunately ,
much less than
is about the same way ,
a little bit
my job
at a industry here is a night operator down here
and do n't really get out a lot , to exercise
is an assistant teacher in business technology
got in and down
it keeps me pretty busy ,
but it is not really the kind of exercise that get your heart rate going .
exercise is so important .
it is .
that and .
is that
play a little basketball and stuff like that ,
is now in college
school during the day , and working at night to
have not really done a whole lot
what do you do ?
do you do it at home or a club
play usually at home .
out living in the country
and me and my brother have a bunch of guys that came over and play
a lot of times we 're up at the church or
stuff like .
really ?
what is it ,
and that 's not bad .
that 's pretty upbeat ,
'll so put in the cassette and go with it
not often enough .
, but do n't know
is just collapse
my fingers and now more than anything
is that
just want to sit down and relax
to exercise .
did
you do ever ride a bike or anything like that ?
of months ago a
'd ride about two or three miles a day , and
of weeks a
and it got
gave up so it
for people about the most common exercise , is here to go to the malls and walk
walk around .
they are
and have to worry about the summer or winter weather
that down here
'll be in town or something
people and will walk around the mall .
and it 's safe .
it is fairly safe .
that 's inside the mall
the garage
certain parts of it
as being the best exercise there is
a lot of
we have a swimming pool ,
but it is an old concrete pool .
we 've been having trouble with it the past few years ,
have n't so
and but
the water and take the resistance .
and you do n't get the soreness .
have done some exercises water ,
's , but not
you ca n't
that 's the way ours is .
you do n't go out to the swimming pool , when it is twenty some odd degrees .
it 's too cold .
hot tubs not too bad
those nice
that 's whereabouts ?
way down towards
not quite on the coast ,
but we 're about two hours from the coast .
and you do have cold weather down there
it started about yesterday .
today , was pretty
and there was no exercise .
you ready ?
is
that 's it .
what kind do you subscribe to
or do you ?
did subscribe to people for a long time
people
to ladies home
and also better homes and gardens
in computers
you have too many recipes first of all .
do n't like about ladies home journal magazines
too many recipes , too many can this nonsense marriage .
like to read articles about things that matter
of course , not people magazine , is one of your more intellectual magazines
but it 's nice , light reading .
,
that 's true .
when they have short stories it
that 's true ,
they did .
really very rarely pick a magazine up ever anymore
do n't
think it 's
surely ,
it 's an institution ,
it would have to be surely .
'll tell you ,
it was publisher 's clearinghouse ,
they were going to take off their list they
too
this was it , my last chance .
my last chance win ten million dollars
so .
for dollars twelve ,
because of that sent to entertainment in my subscription
that 's it .
and was
, do n't know
substance that you can really get not enough .
it is short little articles more than anything else .
do n't like about people
it does n't seem to have enough story to it .
, do n't know
just think it 's light reading
if you 've got only a short time to read .
you do n't have to concentrate .
that 's true .
it 's entertaining ,
,
to the tv guide
not really .
not take now
it 's a magazine
going to be released or behind the scenes
.
might be interested in it ,
it would be
the home journal and the book computer and .
'll rather than having them if otherwise pick up then it
'll tell you ,
the maybe i journal 'll read two , maybe three since
did well really if
because there 's nothing in me interests that just there .
is not into recipes
so that eliminate three quarters of the magazine .
that 's true .
just got the new issue ,
that one article
have got now for this area
have anyway
.
you go ahead , if you 'd like first .
me here think
you get so busy .
used to
have one favorite soap opera
let 's see , and
that 's general hospital ,
known
see 's
are
have a year old and a year ten old seven
they are pretty young .
full house
what is the one comes after that and on .
it 's a new one , ,
, do n't know
my kids older
now know some of those shows
like the comedies
they are just light , too .
now that 's a good one .
of that a
that 's .
i love
really coach and .
thought when it 's good , it 's just a scream .
he 's a good actor .
he is really good .
he probably be playing himself .
these people on an interview show , they
acted and
he could be very well .
have been going to school for years
is taking only one course , but
of seeing those
never .
've got a friend says
it is
never really , you should miss that .
of shows just gems
in every way
nice .
what is that night on now ?
that 's my one night , out and about
your husband maybe could
just so you get .
it would n't take much to get hooked on those .
.
any new ones this year
we started watching northern exposure .
it is not really new ,
but it is still kind of new .
how that 's ?
have n't seen that
it a lot
it 's real different .
in fact , they never thought it would be a hit .
that nobody else does
or it sounds weird ,
but , it 's very unique show and very well done .
excellent actors
'll have to watch for that
it came after something we used to watch on
we kept just sitting there
and now we make
are not going to be able to watch hardly any television
then , it will be mostly reruns , i guess .
a lot of
have seen that
she was the best one ?
she was the best one on that old show ?
she was just funny .
she was really funny .
her character and was good .
in particular , but just the character
had a big fight on that show
of everything in the world each
that was awful
who knows still , and what happened , really .
, known
you will never , probably .
known
do n't have cable
we do n't have that station either ,
have n't been able to catch of that any , so
but little just what we caught on the news .
wild as just as on the news
known
do n't see how he could n't be ,
, known
what is for her in it .
that 's right .
and they said this lawyer 's unbelievable .
but , they said yesterday that she held up so well .
, known
everybody was saying that
it said the paper and then
so , it should be interesting .
was reading in the line supermarket that
never have the nerve to buy the thing
you do watch any sports or anything like that
n't care about that
n't either
always .
think it 's so beautiful
like to catch the gymnastics sometimes , too
that 's good .
to go ahead .
we 're going to compare notes .
often i desire
do n't do it .
,
every day on a regular basis .
, just got back from twelve biking and a half miles
but in this time of year
this president 's council of physical fitness
and it is worth doing ,
and you can do it anywhere .
travel a bit in my business
and you can do it
usually every morning after
so , you do what and
you 'll and hurt yourself .
prone type things , when you 're kind of rocking on your type stomach thing ,
what keep you doing that .
much more modest efforts
up , but
just find
hard to find the time for it on a given day
did that just as a normal basis , and
does a day ups now , but not in the morning
a hundred
about a hundred before supper
and you can
but n't
within reason that you can lose or maintain your weight and your physical being
think it 's really important
have done , because it seem right and good because it has good effects good
ca n't seem to do just
like biking
or you do n't have time or something like that .
earlier a half hour
once you feel good and just
better a whole lot and .
does your wife participate in any of this
not ,
and there 's
or you ca n't talk anyone into it
it is n't
she would
she is
but she is a wonderful woman
, no sense with anybody getting about it in arguments
little bit of
that problem without any external help
no problem at all
you can do that .
it is that kind of half of foam or something inch .
it 's a thing foam ,
long is just about six feet
and do n't take on trips with me it
you could ,
'll throw a towel down or something ,
so it is right up your alley , then .
so .
me push the button
is supposed to be all for switching to the metric system ,
i sense that it 's not going to happen but soon .
do n't think it 's going to happen either ,
it was
's metric stuff and
you 're in what now ?
everything is so metric
you and then read some order book or something
and it 's all confusing
, so do n't understand
think so
i guess , is the policy
but it 's been the policy for a long time
nothing ever and happens .
simply by having it slowly up
doing metric stuff
they have to for international trade .
it is easier to switch back and forth than it used to be because of computers coming
back and forth
what a meter 's , instead of how many feet in a meter or something more
no one knows what is that .
everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind .
do n't see that , it can
the kind of
no one seems to be adopting it .
no one wants it at all seem like , metric system .
measurement money , dollar , coins systems , anything like that
alone in the world in using the old system
pretty tough when
think two systems 's worse than one , though
a lot of problems and things
and you make mistakes more doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems .
metric ,
think so .
want to know how many miles it is to his destination
things you could do
been
there is this one sign 's kind of funny .
it says metric signs next hundred miles .
selling tape measures in inches
a even worse problem with
the metric system
pretty much in all
meant the elementary schools down in
in the elementary schools
do n't know
would n't think so
a ways back
and measured anything or did anything on one system
think my children learned the metric system ,
but it does n't
in an inch
and that 's about it .
advice on son or daughter
have personal experience with
would ask in life , and what would meet best college out of college and what the child hopes to get sort what the child want to do
see 's
went away to school
that was a strict requirement for me .
they get out of school
away for real long periods of time or if
see 's
what was the question ,
what 's the criteria for picking a college ?
what advice would you give ?
what advice
by clear-cut piece advice is one of the college campus
in a dormitory if you stay can .
go to classes ,
talking to faculty members and students
the northern colleges very different than the southern colleges
the people different
you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you 're used to .
thinking in that
think so ?
but with you .
see 's
what .
or if they decided to drop a course decided if they need another year , then they 'd have to get a loan to continue
from other sources and your willingness to work during the summer or part time , one
that 's right .
the responsibility of that
and they could work and earn money towards college .
a lot more financial aid
to a private school
maybe the parents could also pay a third and then
and then maybe they could take out for a third depending on how expensive it 's a loan
not so , it 's too far away ,
mine is
but it is getting there ,
we can still definitely put away the money for college now .
they did not have a car at college
that is , too .
is certainly not my son
is here
did n't have a car in college
think it 's a burden to provide for more
too think so .
the ones do get taken advantage of
and think it 's just trouble waiting to happen
they did n't take and they did n't take a car
and they did n't take a refrigerator .
see me
what have you lately seen ?
five ?
only five ?
and one see six
did n't
found out that
about how
saw just the latest one
is it
it was fantastic .
ca n't wait
the lines in there was just perfect .
it 's just the old guys still .
it was just a rumor that would happen this time .
, however , the rumor is that it will happen ,
that they said they were n't going to do anymore .
that was it .
except that the rumor is still they might ,
but it may not include the entire crew
will and it
is not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the old guys were
think it 's a hundred years
in that range .
that 's right .
is that right ?
he was still a doctor ?
he was
the halls real
did n't look too bad
imagine that
that 's amazing .
but , they did have some pretty good special effects ?
excellent , excellent special effects
think , but the script was just incredible compared to the last one
the script was bad , bad , bad .
you know
n't
why
is that right ?
he direct and even worse .
he did n't in fact
he produced this one .
that was .
think so .
really like
you did get talk to him ?
was
in a crowd like that .
, it want to stand in line for about four hours
a pretty crowded place
they have some good management in this new generation principals .
it is kind of funny .
was reading in a book
trying
ca n't quite remember the name of the book ,
every time , he left the enterprise everything went to hell .
nothing and got right until he got back up on the ship .
so he kind of was a cowboy type , too .
all the decisions
a lot more realistic really .
what other movies have you seen ?
that how
it was pretty good .
there was a few things different than the old series ,
was on a lot of fun but
lots of little funny spots
they did have thing
in fact , thing has a much bigger role than he does in the series .
there are lots of areas where thing saves the day .
he and run around a lot .
how he gets around
finger just
but he is in a box ?
in fact , it 's funny .
he does never come in out of a box .
he was just kind of walking around .
did n't he used to ?
not really .
he was always in the box before .
okay that is .
was thinking
what do you feel
is in an urban area
become a major problem even a major problem more
drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now .
there 's a lot of theft , a lot of assault dealing with people trying to get money for drugs .
think that 's a national problem , though , and
it 's pretty bad here , too .
it 's not unique ,
is sure you have a lot of students there and a lot of researchers and
you may have a little better perhaps economic climate , so
is sure that there 's problems with it ,
over half of it and .
do n't know
every week
most of ours occurring in late at night
now is the decrease in values
a lot of people do n't hold quite human life
and the economy is so bad
so many people and .
the economy is
they 've done special stories on the local news here .
it 's a pretty nice neighborhood
this lady was going to work , and
she come home
everything in her house and was
nobody thought any different , and
they just thought she was moving .
and it stole everything she owned
that really take
it 's pretty bad .
do you 're that security
because there is always somebody at home for the majority in my little section of the neighborhood so
all known and we
and one another know we 're not moving and different things like that
probably one of
.
, most people
, and is in my twenties
is so out
but they are at home at night ,
so really do n't worry about anything
who there is one
is in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything
you would say , it run between the high school and the commercial districts
it is in a nice neighborhood .
the houses before the recession here was running two hundred thousand or so
and , course , everything is down ten to twenty percent now .
that 's the same thing here .
effects are us we have
the economy , and now is bad
they have trouble keeping those full
they are not nearly as selective as they used to be .
and , is course , that kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex .
start
and go down
before drugs and a lot of other things and then you have
is so
how the weather is out there ?
it 's really cold
they more than they snow have and .
about how you guys ?
it is
,
and all that kind of stuff
it is good .
the weather let
what part ?
the snow and is really cold .
it is
or there ?
when the winds blow , it goes
when it 's cold , because it 's really cold .
do n't think there 's any mountains to stop the wind
what is that ?
do n't think there 's any mountains to stop the wind
think that 's true
got too here
we 'd have to get really warm and ,
you do n't and
that 's true .
it was weird .
how long ago did so you ?
or , did you
just so this past year and .
so you just moved barely away ?
you like it out there do ?
the mountains
?
because it 's really flat here .
big no mountains or anything but
so away you just moved a year ago ?
in
really
but what else can say about the weather .
was today
warm .
so , what 's the temperature over there today ?
that not
it 's not that cold , really .
but all the time they talk about chill wind here .
so , is that
that 's true .
that makes a big difference .
who so , did you used to ski when you were out here
what is that ?
but , you do
not tons
a chance but .
have the opportunity a couple times since then
this is actually my third year .
are you and
'll be here , a long time at this rate but
is
it was nursing ,
is in the process of changing it right now , but
you have to have a seven three to get in
that 's true .
is going to look into some other fields
not really just too much
the process of
that 's a good idea .
in a certain field
education .
got
that .
you might know her .
maybe .
so many girls in my all classes
ca n't remember how many people
that program where you can get it
have they ?
how do you feel about capital punishment ?
you did ?
was on the jury
and the topic was something about juries
is so
do feel about it
do n't know
it is right in certain cases
an on the case
so do n't
in deliberations on it probably still
once , we met with the judge ,
the two
and he went to tell us on how they happened to catch this guy
and .
it was about a year ago .
in the very next month another capital murder
they drove , up
the police drove up just as .
so he was caught
county in the past ten years i
there were last year and six
are this guy
you have to wonder so .
if he is going to be drastic , .
although it is really because it does n't mean anything to him .
no concept of
can tell
the guy or anything to
but he does n't
no remorse
and like that , when the guy would
by four attorneys for about five hours
at the time when the guy kept saying but you could
, ca n't imagine
know if beyond a doubt
that ever sure of something
but they really did .
it was really amazing .
a subsequent case that we did n't know about and .
this particular case that they have a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things
no one else so would have known .
it was pretty really interesting .
educational .
do n't see why they would n't bring in the new evidence from other the case
because they can in the phase punishment , but not in the guilt or innocence .
of that crime
it 's not going to take much to prove that .
that work .
they pushing the death penalty ?
this guy is up for the death penalty .
for example
and was the response reasonable given the provocation .
there is a number of questions and
can you give him capital punishment no
where he still qualify for capital punishment
but only the result is that he otherwise gets life in prison .
because it cost dog so much gone is really kind of against life in prison and
to me you take a person 's freedom away , and you have taken most of their life away .
that 's true .
but then you have to look at reality .
normally they may get out
that 's true .
but what is it worth ?
do n't know
have a choice for myself
that 's true .
'd stay in prison or not
do they have the death penalty there and ?
.
they have a number of cases here
not a whole lot
that 's going up so .
but
they have a death penalty .
every now and then
they wo n't let you on death row ,
you look down the hall
you ca n't see any prisoners
and it is
they took around on a tour us ,
and got to walk in the gas chamber
knowing that you are sitting there
that 's right .
is
if you were going to have a dinner party , what would make you ?
see 's
like
see 's
that sounds good .
would that
that way , and you can have a variety .
fresh vegetables would be good
the meal , what type of wine and then would have with seafood when ?
all these hard questions
what , white wine ?
that would be my guess .
, then dessert
is not really a drinker ,
so do n't know a lot about that
something sweet ?
chocolate chocolate
you must like chocolate .
's see
?
so , we might have some cheese some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip .
and you have a nice real dip that goes good with a cocktail .
barbecue steaks or pork chops and
then lot of times we 'll have baked potatoes with them , and a salad and
and then do n't know what we 've usually for dessert
sometimes , cake
but that 's what we would do for a dinner party , i guess .
that sounds too good , .
friends come over
traditional
traditional
would n't be the big snotty kind
really started , learning about that just
do n't
her cookbook
all different types of the different types of parties and that
in the food business
my father owns a restaurant .
it 's just a cafe ,
it 's not
from which high school
that 's a public school or private and ?
that 's public .
have to get to know this area a little better , i guess
your father 's cafe one you could cater out of 's ?
it 's not .
see 's
for
see 's
that would be good .
fruits and pineapple
see 's
you could actually and if you wanted to go with a chicken .
about what is being done about recycling
lots ?
what do you do , now ?
so we 've done that for quite some time ,
of what it used to be about a
so the troop scout boy quit when the city took over it doing it .
.
said they have n't got theirs for me in the library just about a week ago
is that
it does go in cycles ,
not everyone got right away and theirs .
we used to take there ours .
my garage just were getting overwhelmed .
known
and of course , did n't go weekly
so it , become quite a big thing
really glad
but do n't use as many of those
hard to convince yourself to do
so it was wasting a lot of time .
and putting it in there wasting all your time and effort
buying , as far as those jars
but that it 's not that hard now .
got down
for your garbage you pick up by the weight
with the recycling in
that 's right .
thought about the other day
and what have yet going to do when
probably going to throw them in your trash
that 's what happens
places take car batteries ,
kind of a pain drive for two little tiny batteries over
think , but the one city could possibly look into that or something
that 's true .
that 's true .
is that right ?
was reading it
our garbage
they must be trying to keep track of who are doing .
do n't know
it be nice if you could get a credit back at .
for
that would encourage it .
it would be effective cost , not just
they have already got out on getting the trucks and hiring people to work them all this money .
is sure they could n't afford that
now there are just one man who comes on the truck instead of two garbage .
that is interesting .
but our big green garbage thing
it did ?
and we call
and they brought a new one us
and they did not charge us .
and they said between three and four hundred have been stolen .
is n't
it is sad .
you know ,
they paid for those things anyway .
and they must be really expensive .
our taxes or .
of course , we were hoping that we were n't going to have to pay for it
but what would .
how do you feel about capital punishment ?
is not certain it does a lot of good that it ends up avoiding effectively a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties
, do n't know yet on
it 's the right thing to do .
do n't know
what about yourself ?
have the same dilemma
it seems right sometimes
other times , and then you do n't know .
and they 're extremely severe .
it does n't serve as the reason
you walk around the rest of your life with one hand and
for everybody and know exactly what .
or there 's a good chance you 're going to get off .
also , it does n't seem like it does that many harm , and
their life , is taken
but they 'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway ,
sometimes they 'd prefer just so
them pay for what they 've done
the average cost to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is extremely high
it 's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year .
and it 's sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment ,
they 're out never really going to be , but on
ca n't then again , but also bring back lives that have been taken anyway ,
, do n't know
, known
taking more life one does n't get the way they were things back .
, do n't know
really do n't know ,
in what
you calling from
,
more and more states
it is one of the quickest ,
by the supreme court , the interpretation of the constitution a
and it seems like everybody stopped
by lethal injection .
and by hanging there .
the movie in cold blood
is sure you are familiar with it ,
but , have you seen the movie ?
, have n't
that way .
it and that way ?
,
and it 's not so ,
it is kind of a barn like structure .
think they are there ,
is not really familiar
is that right ?
you there in school
.
they do it by this a bunch of men have guns
one of them have and the real gun in it .
have a real bullets
known
known
as long as it seems not so bad , i guess .
see 's
what type of car do want
my weekly wages , but do n't apply for me to have that kind of car
is
so 'll get a car for economic reasons
so , to drive to back and forth .
we have a truck , and
what kind of a car do you 've now ?
my car is too old really
i drive out of town a lot of the weekends
would like my car next to have good gas mileage and
and
but too expensive , and not a nice car
hardly drive ,
but while we 're talking ,
'd while we 're talking
but it 's expensive
insurance and then is too high for that really
is too not because of insurance , then
known
do that insurance come into play .
about that
what kind of insurance
it or are real up there high ?
is not really sure how much i pay and
is in college
take her word for it
that insurance is high dollars .
it is ,
the more expensive the car , the and it is higher
wo n't be driving , anything too expensive so
do n't plan on buying a car for many , many years
last as long as
's everybody up there
because of snow and everything , do you all need four wheel drives up there or ?
we do n't have any snow here now .
there is no snow at all .
we have yet snow
we usually get only .
kind of
it is .
do n't tell me that
there is it ?
actually , it 's been warm ,
that 's really warm and .
and it is
have only once this year seen snow
and it was really bad
now there are no snow , and
but what is your dream car ?
about it really
is not too big on cars
, do n't know the names and stuff
was to go to a lot car and look at them
is
for a car ?
if it was an just .
?
but get white
what kind of car do you drive right now ?
is it not
and hope it does , though
it 's a two door .
smaller cars
them more comfortable to drive
to be sure ,
could
be down here before ?
you did like it ?
it was busy .
it is different i bet .
it was nice .
it was really cold up here , and
that was so nice .
, have n't been to many places
her family , live there
and she is only been once there .
her grandmother live there
is
that 's great .
probably the most exciting place
actually .
why ,
have you ?
was
was just wondering what it was like
where 's that ?
and it is the western half of an island ,
where we would spend just three months in a foreign country , most of them third world countries
that turned out to be a really good for me experience .
was in high school , actually
on the farm
not that much
was n't a great asset to them or anything
went to a camp youth that included working at an old people 's home and
that was pretty interesting and .
and how long do you plan to be going for ?
two weeks .
last time she stayed two months ,
but we 're going to stay two weeks only .
, is going to take we
so that might be fun .
a what ?
class
french
what you planning to do , if anything and ?
museums
actually
went to any of them
is that
that was nice .
have n't
have you ?
are wanting to go there
where you gone first have
have gone
do you do any recycling ?
here .
aluminum cans and plastic bottles
is that
about what you guys ?
of different places a
gives you
for cans ?
a penny down
hold on
just to succeed .
heard that time it
you guys get only .
you buy canned drinks and stuff like that
charge like that
they charge you for the deposit ,
type of thing
they do n't
that is , though
it 's really .
just what happens we 're really get .
then that is so when back twelve cents .
you guys actually so can get ahead .
or paid for
everyone does newspapers .
everybody do newspapers .
else or it does n't fit in their little containers
are they and not
send it to this address ,
but let 's see ,
tell
in other words , taking care of the environment is all well and good
if is going to cost you to take it , but they are .
as likely to do it
that 's true .
some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass on to the consumer
if it is free , people , will use it
if it costs them something , then they are not likely to use it as
apparently there just down .
that 's good .
and you do n't get near as much as for you , bought it that way
but you got the use out of it
is so before
we 're ready to start
what part of the country
what about yourself ?
the two conversations
here for now almost five years
.
you seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood
that 's right ,
but like
getting away from the snow
missed it at first ,
but now going back there
and is
like so
it 's nice .
that 's good .
have around in the northeast
, but do n't know
would want to take on
is that
known
tell me where that is ,
probably do know ,
but do n't know it by that name
we 're just north .
that area
that 's a nice area .
we have some very nice homes here in this area .
us describe the area
that are quite a range .
the homes that were here was smaller earlier .
got
and of course , it 's
all the values over here because of the economy dropped off
about how you ?
we have a similar situation
and then we 've got bent tree right across the street
so do n't
some of those pretty big
over a million
all they 'd be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles .
is exactly what happens over all but
have
do you live in a lot zero home ,
we 've got a house ,
see 's
we moved in about four years ago
had previously
for three years
a whole block of homes that
he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank
was so
vacant before finally because there were many so they sold them for
was your house in good shape ,
it was
it with the doors and windows open running constantly just
it was ?
.
we have any problems
get because we figured we could n't afford anything being from the northeast
the prices much lower here
and this was
'll tell you , but
it takes all my time .
is really
is familiar with that
we bought it from someone who was in it , and
empty for the better part of a year
and are not sure what happened ,
do know the folks bought it from that we have done virtually no maintenance for about four years , but
found a lot of things ,
are we
what changes
the first thing been for the right , for women to vote
the work force than there was
and that 's probably going to increase .
each year increases , does n't it ?
is
think it increases each
it sure does .
a lot more women in
role ?
that is changing .
to some degree
but think it 's not as much as it was
.
change
especially with women and they 're going to have to demand more from men increasingly working
because there is just , impossible to keep up on everything else .
have more of an active role in taking care of children , more of an active role in taking care of the home
and do n't know what the status is on it ,
much about that recently
your sick left
is that right ?
company bigger companies
and that was the reason
because they thought
that is interesting .
it is .
you got to take the time off .
you have to save all of your vacation time .
.
you have to save all your vacation time
and that is usually how
you do
think we 're probably going to see a lot more companies run by females
and top
is
top
management
more women
and we 'll probably see more females in political roles .
more governors and roles like .
kind of
that 's right ,
that 's right .
her term and just ended
going probably
think that 's good probably
a little more integration
--
that 's fine with me and
thought
that as far as
n't either
that men and women equal
just function .
and are not capable of lifting what a man , can lift and type of thing that
have
is that
women working out of their homes ?
it is
you have to check once or a week twice in with the office only
, they are talking
by the phone and all that
a little bit of that more
and some ways , it might be kind of scary .
think anybody could do it ,
would n't mind calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking up it just
then there are , but the process of selection .
you would have to give them the brand
shop , usually
would be nice , though
do they have one ?
.
did n't know that
already learned something
see 's
spend with your children ?
because they are grown .
what ?
they are grown and gone .
and the other one is in high school .
you do so then spend less time
almost because they do n't want to know us .
they want to be with their friends .
your kids
or what
and then two
and are not sure
for sure .
you have a lot of kids .
we have six between the spouse and myself .
that 's kind of nice , though .
come with a split family
there are so much of them
and they 're doing their own things
that 's true .
they have to see too .
they want to do their own thing , and sometimes
so it 's just spouse and me sometimes .
known
and you know
what ?
that are sometimes
known
that 's what one time my mother said .
they just got to come to see all the time for the holidays us over .
that 's true ,
either them to that 's not good and .
see 's
they do all live in the area ?
of the six , we 've got four around here .
how they did end up so far away ?
that is , my little pair
the youngest ones
the fourth and fifth child of the , six
a long way
and they wanted to go ,
they wanted so there to make their homes .
that is where they have gone to make .
are
there or going to school or what they just working up ?
see 's
meant to , especially if they are .
certainly hope so .
so it 's never too late .
it 's never too late
especially think they have about older twenty percent students in some of these schools around here
have seen
they look like in their very late sixties
and say that 's great ,
why .
why
believe
is not quite and yet in that category
seasoned minds but .
you 're ready to learn finally really .
it was a complete waste of money .
to , study
our limitations and .
we do n't go out drinking and try to go to class in the morning .
at seven ,
we are past that age .
we 're
what we can do
is so see
so do n't spend a whole lot of time because they are not here
what was it ,
other , families
the trends in the families was spread apart , do your own thing .
that 's right .
are seeing a change that government ca n't do it , but
a change ?
was going to say the same thing
schools
the family and
going to have to solve some of the problem
firmly that
tell what was our topic ?
is n't it
are
bet .
, have been a hacker
, did
did
they do n't have a muscle in their body
, known
a lot of golf , i play six to eight times a year
and that 's about it .
i figure that 's my retirement game .
come from a family of golfers
that was their deal ,
that 's what it takes ,
you need play that often to get a really good handicap .
could do it , but just never
and has a very good handicap and play he
was going to get out and start playing a lot more
and went after it
and did n't really find much improvement and
, it seemed like the score , would go back up ever
probably need more often take some more lessons and practice
is probably the same way
help
this unlimited dinner ducks to
it 's a hunter 's type affair
is familiar with it
we have a ball , and just
three days in a row , three different courses
gone down to about a hundred and five from a hundred and twenty
think if it makes a big difference
bet
so that makes a lot of difference to me .
try to work out regularly
are doing that and feeling loose
through the ball get better
have gotten
bet .
my control there is a little bit better .
is that
what learned to hit the ball easy
is always wanting to hit hard it
out from playing like twelve , fourteen holes , a lot of my energy 's gone
it 's an easier swing
hit the ball better
have you tried a iron one ever ?
have a wedge through two
hit a two iron awful lot
do n't hit a driver off the tee
need my driving lessons
mine back in my bag , too , this year
and used a rather than a driver wood three
.
had a lot more control on it ,
but was n't every time in trouble
that 's a good idea .
is going to attempt to play more
and are going to do the same thing
lay off about three years ago my woods
a wood off the fairway two
and is a fairly strong person
so get a pretty good little drive
control irons my
if 'll take in you your hand is an iron .
myself and my son
is that you need more often than i play play
think there 's less frustration factor there , too ,
makes good sense
and the iron one try to start
they are very difficult to play with , apparently
that can knock a iron one ,
it is incredible .
is his accuracy and
but it 's
he used
, iron distance
bet .
can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around watching you
get away , and
which one have you got right now ?
of them
and got a leading edge
just a
what do you 've ?
it is
what did you
put together it ?
and it is now a fast machine .
is for it to say that
what do you use it for ?
what do you use it for ?
work ,
is a contract programmer
.
scientific applications like science petroleum stuff and test equipment , business
did and one of a touch for a company that sell screens touch screen the demonstration , was
it was kind of fun .
that sounds interesting .
a lot of graphics in there
that is .
it 's slow .
that will slow you , up .
and really need a faster system .
who 's that ?
and my notebook is around here somewhere .
can make far enough
tried to do is to get this outfit
got my other ones by selling their product for them
that work .
it is here .
are
where
that 's about lookout there is n't it .
just of there
is a little place
there in
he gives reasonable prices , .
that 's a good deal .
it was pretty reasonable .
and he does a good job
he , and guarantees everything he sells .
there 's a lot ,
by lucky computer there
, used to
have n't been doing of that for the last year or so much
so do n't
they are still doing business .
that works ,
'll go do that
and now that thing scream .
that was n't alive for but maybe two years .
thought
is that right ?
that 's it ?
it 's about ten bucks when it comes on the manufacturing floor .
what do you think about the insurance business self ?
what you 're saying ,
and there 's probably to that some truth .
added responsibilities government
when anybody ca n't police their own profession , however , it leads to that eventually ,
think they 're asking for it
think the medical profession is pushing just until there is no option but the government
do you think that it 's just medical guys ?
what is about how expensive new equipment and technology .
think most of the cost is coming
think a lot of it , is
, do n't totally disagree with that
but my wife this last summer when we were on vacation tore her knee , up
she and got home ,
he knows knee problems ,
if anyone do , this guy know it .
she goes , in
think this is what it is ,
a thousand dollars for this type magnetic resonance imaging thing
my wife do need that
going to have this thing
insurance wo n't pick up this unless you 're in the hospital .
doctors send routinely people in for anything .
for years that they did n't have this
these problems
said to her , look
you got to go , go ,
, do n't know what it 's
but there are kickbacks to fill these machines up night and days .
hundred every half hour , five hundred thousand dollars , at roughly a thousand dollars
do n't care what say anyone
it 's a picture .
but n't
they do n't have to pay them back in three months time .
'll have to agree there , with you ,
but there is another problem ,
if the doctor make a mistake , he can
think that 's another problem ,
and that , the government will eventually address just too because it is out of control
with you .
was on a jury
, did n't make
was a doctor
it was three days after it was born ,
and he was the one that delivered it .
and they got attorneys four ,
five million dollars
five million bucks , is n't going to bring back this kid
should he if the doctor 's wrong
five million dollars but
and he goes because insurance , pay for it away
, does n't make it
it does n't .
you do
is a teacher school
and ,
off that
is
she comes to the school
a group of teachers and
regularly for an hour and
and twice a week .
that 's good
aerobics , for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes
so it 's an hour .
and then take often as possible
not on if he wants to
but we take
and then to come back to the house
so , and we seriously , take it .
we enjoy doing it .
my group at school
a lot more fun with to exercise somebody is is to do it by
i use to exercise regularly
lately and have n't
also i use to take
.
never have been able to do it before
of the day the
just want to go home and not to do anything
and too
make just myself
up at five thirty
and is at school at seven thirty
not be school over until four
but it is in the building
that 's the big difference
you had better hurry .
going
there are motivation around there
and then we can change in the building right there .
do n't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere
and just go
exercise and .
exercise clubs
have done before that , and
be late at night after and after dinner
try immediately after school
to try to get from five to six some place and exercise ,
but then you get home and you get by the time .
that 's right .
that 's right .
it is .
our life style
go during
and that 's just too long .
that 's out for me .
really do n't do it
do n't think so
of waiting on us
paying a lot more money
there or not
that 's right .
that 's right .
work out real nicely
in fact , she charges us a session two dollars .
that 's not much .
six weeks at a time cause is a unit in school report card period
that 's not bad .
it beat memberships at some of these clubs .
that 's for sure .
they real expensive
known
we belonged for a period of time to the club signature for about a year .
we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our membership family
we at first and used it
and then it got where we were n't beginning to get out money 's worth .
they offered and lots of things ,
but we were n't taking advantage of them because we did n't have .
so we decided to forget that .
that was just a waste of our money .
we have one through work
but do n't know
still do n't cause going it up just
if it 's only walk the dog or something .
need start doing that
it does make you feel better .
the hard thing is getting going .
that 's right .
and if you have somebody who will do it with you ,
you think you 're getting your money 's worth
never
that is probably the next year 's agenda .
tell , what
something like that
a way to tax every time you
and , we 're going to pay for the bureaucracy , i guess .
it 's one area that are really hurting the economy more than anything .
available for spending for any kind of products
and think that probably be as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now
tell ,
or a few cents more onto the price of gasoline
that 's right .
that 's right .
that 's right .
they tax even food
with the sales tax the problem is , of course , it 's an unfair tax across
people with the lowest income but now pay
where people make two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that , and .
that 's the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue , and
but do n't think it 's anymore ,
got you ,
that people up spending it all
that 's right ,
that 's right .
whatever they they have to pay tax on .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
think , but
what do you think of that luxury car new tax , anything over thirty thousand dollars ?
if , like other things , you do n't worry too much about them .
have trouble still buying a thousand twenty dollar car ,
of sympathy on that a
that you buy , maybe
, have n't
another ten percent tax on
and there 's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand .
,
.
is the idea of that kind of taxation and
buy ,
it 's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids .
it is a way of increasing the population ,
that was one of the initial ideas of giving exemptions on kids , on federal taxes .
do n't know if that 's true or not ,
that might make certain sense in stimulating purchasers consumer but if
like booze example , they keep raising the taxes on booze ,
they quit buying it .
what about the taxes on cigarettes ?
having
's see
is not planning the menu
you 're not .
go out to either one of our folks usually
, but do n't know
should you mention that .
is a farmer pig
you
it is more than anything else kind of a hobby ,
mating with the sows
and you ca n't use the piglets ,
it 's about six months of no use ,
cleaned him out
rather than pay the four vet hundred dollars for surgery , we 'll and just cook him and eat him .
that is hard ?
tell , what
is preparing a little pig
, is telling you
, easier than chicken
,
most guys
they 're gone in
after about six hours , and you put
best what you had ever
just like a pig
do it .
it has a lot less fat .
he and to almost two hundred and pounds ten out .
and the feet off
and that was about a hundred pounds of just ham .
we 're not going to eat the whole thing .
eat it all
it would take a year .
it 's just tough as a boot
and , they used to use it for leather .
so it 's really a tough piece of meat
but it 's so tasty , you ca n't stand it .
you just so take it
that and up .
one about four hours
about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds
and we 're going to have that .
serve with your pig ?
we still have tomatoes
do you ?
fresh tomatoes
we just got lots of snow .
up around here
and half of that is down .
it is degrees thirty this morning .
did n't
it 's desert ,
, the edge of the desert , it is ,
it is part of the great plains .
so it goes up in the days in the summer time to a hundred , hundred and ten
everything who live around here is so real tough .
that 's trees ,
hundred trees year old
is that the bigger all they
they are just as a rock hard .
to go ahead .
what kind of car would want to buy .
do n't know
, would want to buy
or would probably actually buy .
may be different two things
if you have all the money in the world or something .
then , if that 's whole different matter .
do n't know in that case
'd want one of those now
would want one if somebody was given to me of course
what do you 've now ?
it is the first car we bought ever new actually .
my car is the first one ever we bought new , too .
we just bought , but actually
me too
what car
what is it ?
we bought almost one of those .
you do like it ?
,
was doing a lot of business traveling , after
mine and is
it handled a lot better
it had a lot more pickup and everything .
a little more control over when it is doing the things it is doing
to rent those kind of cars .
to what ,
but we have corporate contracts with the various companies
.
so it depends on your destination , too .
of
you work for a big company , then .
.
but
, do n't know
really some big once money and .
it did ,
they have a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time
that was great .
it was .
is that
usually breaks
you look at the warranty
and it is excluded .
we bought the extension
,
you got your money 's worth .
we did ,
really we but at
did it and of
that 's good .
but we still have three years left on it .
have been lucky
a shopping cart
the lens to
bumper ?
it did n't actually
that was good .
the store and will pay for it anyway ,
big no deal .
you would buy if you were going to buy a car new ?
probably would n't
decided although we did just buy ,
and that 's a legend
those nice
but it 's
want for a long time
performed so well
also have an accord ,
it was a real one old
and that used
have absolutely no money to my name
and it served me real well , too .
drive one
it is
, is not certain
but she 's liked it .
we have only one car for a long time ,
four miles to work and kind of thing back , and most of our usage of the car was back and forth
how did it for you go ?
are it
left
that 's what it is exactly ,
cheap little to just go run in a car
known
it actually be kind of fun to drive .
and it is
my husband think about my car now , that he is
the
like you 're in a boat or something ,
, ca n't drive that
the legend , it 's just so huge .
, do n't like it
that a little town or a bigger city ?
it 's not one of the bigger ones .
a little smaller maybe
think to someone that was
forgot the name of the town
thought it was maybe you
we are supposed to talk .
is studying it now in college
say , first of all , they need go back to spending more time on the basic reading , arithmetic in school grade , writing
and it shows up .
that is one idea .
you do have any ?
, do n't know
and my dad , is on the school board there actually
so , i kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on .
that 's for sure .
it used to be the pits .
's overall speaking just across the country , but
is something wrong definitely .
, do n't they and , thing
from year to year
and they ca n't read truly
when they ca n't read anything history
so that definitely is a problem .
the people in the system
you think so what 's good about the schools ?
depends
they are so all different .
that is another thing about the united states .
there is no national curriculum ,
you may have half literature for the whole year ,
they 're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature , in another one
grammar .
it is up to the teacher , in other words .
so is that kind of odd .
it depends on what school you 're in and is your teacher , actually
we when we moved here lucked out
are we where our kids might be in a great school and
but do you think there should be curriculum nationwide ?
do n't know
that just about read the other day
have never and
it makes sense to a certain extent , actually
get kids from second grade than did n't learn what they should do to even
we 'd have at least a certain amount that would all kids learn
we want to keep paying for these people who ca n't make in society
do you think it should be done
do n't know
obviously be nobody smart enough
probably ca n't so
think that 's a starting at least , going back to the basics in the early grades so
and that 's a big jump .
that .
did
through high school
you think about aids research
aids , is a nasty , terrible disease
you and .
think so they need look into it
and it is kind of like cancer .
how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer .
think it 'll probably be difficult as
how about yourself
is certainly in favor of aids research ,
thought and probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does
killing that many people now , it still have the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem
and
whose figure
do n't know
heard on the radio
things on the radio that could be true or could n't be ,
they are spending a a year on this aids research billion or so
do you think they should spend more ?
think they should , actually
think that , in
a good thing for
he had the virus
?
, do n't know
more strongly , as they would probably for a lot of other people
called by a bunch of the media
think he probably is doing the right thing for a man in his position
is that he is doing it
it is what many people have already done , who was just less famous .
took advantage of the opportunity when he came out
to my kids about it
have n't done before
that 's good .
young for kids , because he did
's see
some of the other questions
's see
do n't have any friends that have the disease
you might not
.
my cousin do , for instance , .
it 's pretty nasty ?
it is .
he had for
he is now in full-blown aids , not really doing very well
it sounds awful .
it 's a very nasty thing .
system to properly function
that is basically , that the immune system can at first slow down , it
the white blood cell count , and goes down
is that
things get out of control completely
people and in that case prone to getting before any kind of weird cancer that only animals got
that sort of thing ,
anything is going to be done about it
you do n't think anything should be done in the short term
the short term , the recession is getting top attention .
think you 're absolutely right there
whether it 's on the books or not officially
and that 's
so this creates a pretty serious problem that 's going to continue .
if it ca n't help with the deficit picture possibly
it can only hurt the picture deficit .
the severity of the picture deficit limit the options available
that 's the current predicament so .
people have to pay less money in taxes
to productivity , particularly commercial productivity which in turn will generate revenue
it 's sort of an unending spiral ,
it 's probably a judgment of how bad is the recession .
other things that could do the administration
indeed , with interest rates
think that 's been a positive development
at the moment we are doing very well on inflation .
the sort of
it 's a sort of a piece of luck .
to the recession the
, do n't know
can be done in the long term
can be done or will be done
consider depending on the world situation at various places to look for
various other areas such as
we 'd do well to make , reductions there in the longer term .
certainly in the second situation
's inclined to agree with you , too
think we would ,
a lot of education aid
what you 're saying
the people and then .
and then they do n't provide very much education .
circumstances like that , around
how did it go ?
you across with plumbing , which one thing , led to another in older homes run
clear back to the main drain
like starting over , i guess
believe me .
, do n't know
, then you probably wo n't have that problem again
it is good for another thirty years .
you 've got an older house ?
was once copper ,
is that right .
plastic pipe and cement to fit them together me
nothing , and wanted to go
go all the way back to the main drain
just starting at
wrong and then if
everything went all right .
everything worked .
and just said
.
glad when that happens
but it all together , came
felt pretty fortunate so
all worked out all right .
about how you ?
probably was painting and wallpaper room
used the wrong kind of painting
it very well up
what kind of painting ?
it was flat
wonder and
so it 's
are you
do n't
is it ?
it is
pink
it 's kind of got just kind of a worn look to it .
did n't quite turn out
more than one of painting
coats two on it
it is a small room , and
it took only
you did n't have to mix painting then .
mix , as far as
are saying
have only the entire room but
how that 'd go ?
kind of fun , is n't it .
that 's an education in itself .
take quite a few rolls , even a small room , if you 're trying to match a design of all first
you have to check for when you buy your paper
that 's what
and did n't think about that
are a lot and so
it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats normally .
did n't think to look for that even
, is being what it ended up
did n't
or did you start at the edge ?
that 's how you 're
started at one edge
then you have to cut around the closet and cut around a window
start right there .
you do
the advantage ,
how do you get your main source of current events ?
was taking the wall street journal ,
that was a good way ,
about five different magazines that keeps up on things me
it 's a week or two , late
are staying up
either watch the news
or 'll read the paper
present on the news
think the media is a little bit manipulative too
lead you too much
they are not very open , and sometimes
, do n't know
a little bit
when it happened first it was he was guilty , he was guilty he was guilty .
or
on when we have desert storm and stuff like that
the whole sides of everything
it make their opinion so
, instead of reporting the news , it 's
have
, it is n't it
of words just a
a communications
so , communications .
into becoming a reporter
, was
went
went with the department of in retirement disability state treasurer , and
calculate benefits
i bet is a interesting job .
and working for state government , .
keep with current events
are reading right now
it is week information .
it 's a lot of money .
more a hundred million a year
it 's a lot of money .
it is .
you have to stay on stuff up , and
your job that you have to ,
you do read the wall street journal ?
deal with the state employees , primarily
what is the budget
the billions of
and it 's just funny .
so do n't have a whole lot of faith in , the news
but it 's not always percent reliable one hundred
our news media
think they need before they would report somebody just go into a little bit more depth
because the is another example .
found a cure
the headlines on the news or what is , someone say they found a cure for aids .
and then it 's two months later
before they come out with something like that they need research a little bit more the matter .
, so they have big the story
that ,
it ,
there .
me about the car you have
'll be honest with you and
and it does its job .
just that car but .
it 's a straight stick speed five machine .
but it is in beautiful shape .
that 's very interesting .
exactly the same experience got with
x l ?
is still here
is
what ?
it was an x l ?
it 's an x l ,
four door ,
comfortable very car
and very happy with it ,
brief trips and things like that
they are
.
and it is absolutely just an wild highway .
there is no doubt about that
because i run over to crystal city , or , used to
of this month the
that goes on over there
and you 've got it ,
they are expensive cars to keep when they need service , up
had a lot of luck with them
a inclined kind of person
under the hood getting
and
six hundred miles on a tank of gas
known
it 's amazing really .
beautiful , beautiful machine
incredible .
anyway , have been looking at the prices of these cars and so forth
, is that right
some of the top end ones
you can still get , even the low end wagons for less than twenty thousand dollars
there are so lots and lots of them ,
the paper and look at them , and so
of a new car person who other thing is the too much
bought one or two new cars in my life
have sometimes even four and five or six years old , to buy
an amount of mileage on it low
and
you guys do n't have a big problem with air pollution as many as
we have a terrible air pollution problem .
really do you ?
our summers
that 's horrible .
it is not as severe in the winter .
but if it can be really bad .
do n't think it 's going to go very far ,
but it was a way of triggering awareness .
most of my life
and we used to have the warning posted days .
they now as far as health concerns post warnings
so , they have tried to do a lot of that
and there 's a real promotion of biking
on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere
and air pollution horrible how
but this problem could be really
in some of the lakes that have been suffering from the acid rain
may and
you like to own a piece of property
up here in this sector it is really a serious issue for those of us up
it or do come mostly from industry up there ?
that cause the acid rain .
is
do know it 's a problem , but
with my parents
had and
went back to visit , recently about a year ago ,
asked them , and
see 's
my husband do
but he does all the heavy stuff , basically
all the stuff fun and .
we have it just opposite here .
my wife work ,
when she gets home like so she
.
we have about acres ten , and
about half of it
that 's a big job .
it is doing real well ,
dirt in a lot of places
water and a little bit of course
that 's just too much to water at once all ,
bet it is beautiful
but we do n't do much in the way of flowers .
little one flower garden
the rest of it 's just wild flowers
wild flowers
they are about a third the size of of your hand palm
that sound .
the wild flowers beautiful
was thinking about throwing some in the back , just in the back , behind the swing way
or ,
you do n't really then
sort of thing
ca n't believe it
.
a lot of women
get there and
but on my husband , take it
'll rake help the grass up , and
'll and sometimes
because , we do n't have that much property ,
but we 're on a lot corner ,
a lot of
and that 's what is nice ,
about any of that
we do n't even
that 's nice ,
have n't
and it 's been a little more country with the trees ,
and we do miss that .
we but together .
actually was talking about this fall ,
and we 're
we just to be building a standing along the east property line
is trying to do right through you like you 're not even there
we have glory morning and
that sounds pretty so .
the doors open and in the house .
they do n't do any damage , though , ,
they do n't like it because there 's nothing to eat here in
.
have when you 're as busy as one of those babies and
.
that sounds
we just got our last tomatoes .
there 's nothing like them .
they just do n't have the same in the supermarket ones .
of the tomatoes a
of course you 're going to lose some way that
the seeds and right through them .
.
to begin
i guess space , is real important
of our kids but every generation not only the
that
frontier stuff new
going now pretty far
star wars are not too far .
have you .
about it
get all the time ,
people talking all the time
just like fiction science
it 's like they , , to take off
do n't know
you think you 'd go up in space , if you have a chance
do you ,
think
be
would just sitting here talking about it ,
if the time came , but it 'd be real nervous .
be
flags worse than six scared roller coaster me
be
had a tire that came off of a car ,
.
depending on what was left of my technology to get me home
and opening up those stations
they are talking about doing that again , too .
do n't know if we 'll see that there up ever
at least we 're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years .
that 's all beyond my imagination really .
science fiction books
and not in those cartoons it is what they have all ,
so you never know .
we have a lot of those , and
so you never know
but as far as
, do n't know
vital real for the future generations to come
, it got the extra little oomph of interest
is sure it 'll draw too , once it is possible more , a lot more interest
they 'd and go up and do things
it 's probably going , still
research will go on .
, known
we do n't know who is now handling them and
so that 's a whole different story now .
at least that 's what everybody says .
you 're a republic ,
you do n't want those ,
you do n't want those .
they splitting up all now it ,
one of them crazy guys , and get
you never know .
much .
one hope .
that way , but you ca n't tell that never .
some butt ,
tell me about your home .
it 's me , my wife and two young boys .
you and which right now is in either a lot line zero or a home garden
so we do n't have a big yard .
but it was when the just two of us .
so it was enough .
because it 's not a full two story .
so , it 's got high real ceilings on half the house
and the other half are
and it 's about a year old house five now .
it sounds nice .
it 's pretty nice .
unfortunately , the builder who built it already went out of business .
is the one who built it
that 's true .
's insulating myself from that problem and
exactly what happened to them .
is building my own house
that 's nice .
can envision all the insulation what 's going up today and as
you doing it yourself
used to be a builder
that 's nice .
retired about five years ago
.
and is now a college educated builder
there are still no work .
so decided this summer that we have enough credit on the credit cards to buy
did so
that 's great .
your own home and say a law has
that is so ?
did n't know that
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build
but you ca n't borrow the money to build .
kind of
and then it does n't sell
the bank 's and then holding the bag .
, anything that involve the government work half
that 's right .
hence the savings and loan problem we have .
that 's true .
but my home is fairly simple .
is designed to
that 's good .
i figure it 's just me and my wife
want to have a shopping so
you got on it
ten acres .
that 's nice .
is that
ca n't see
of a hill the other
and my nearest second neighbor 's
.
that 's pretty good .
can see another guy in the winter time
can make just out his place
a mile thirty view to
that 's pretty good .
the house has
you do n't plan on putting of that in any
it 's got a very small furnace .
have to use the heat
that 's pretty good .
are all glass
could get in it
's glass and
so it 's almost all glass .
my wife would love that .
there 's no place in the house where you can stand and not see .
she love lots of windows .
that 's great .
it is a single story ?
not really .
of a hill the
.
is about four feet deep
.
is about six feet high and
have so got a pretty good grade there
have always
we do n't have much yard
built in the back a small deck , but
dig your own deck
a nice real deck and so size property , one with a grade on it .
is
is that
did n't
see me
do n't know if that took or not ,
'll do it again
you 've kids
you heard her in the background .
that 's babies .
that 's your full time hobby ?
a lot of time
most sports
like to do that
little bit of embroidery work .
what do you like to do ?
is not very good at it
is
not really .
you , like
, but not the ones that gives me the ability to be
that 's right .
always so try .
it is n't
and it is .
it is ,
and measure because you need so much room it
how elaborate you get
have been doing that
that 's a lot of work .
.
my thumb a few times
that feel really good .
that 's not really my favorite thing to do or anything , so
need do it , but
to do it
see 's
have a dog and a lot of fishing
are keeping fishing my biggest hobby .
keeping fishing
keeping dogs
and you have to clean out the tank too probably .
as much as
had fishing as a kid
and they always immediately , died
think now is the reason
build up the bacteria
then it and keep all the chemicals in balance .
.
, and would kill it
and so you 'd have to start to build up probably that all over .
that 's right .
and do n't
do n't go through the whole yards nine
and they need a little bit of that kind of .
that 's right .
that 's right .
you have fishing for a long time
had them
had a tank here
and used to have a gallon five small tank
but that never worked well .
what size do you 've now ?
that 's a good size .
it 's a lot easier .
.
that 's right ,
really .
you do have all kinds of different fishing
real
the expensive ones
they 're probably harder to take care of
.
they are very expensive
and it 's when
i bet it is .
lost you
problems with the fishing eating
not really .
if there is only fishing baby .
you have to isolate those always .
how do you isolate them ?
they have breeders .
that sort a little plastic things is it
the mother fish in there
it 's got a trough underneath her and then
so fall in the trough down as
so the mother ca n't get to them either
of
got so can the water circulate slots in it also
a small real one and on 'll fit out the slots .
it 'll go through the slot .
that 's right ,
but , i guess , it works .
that work all right then .
they do n't want the mothers to be with the little fishing either .
they 'll eat them .
they will .
is n't
you would n't think that .
she had every single babies
all the time ,
her variety , it say they wo n't eat the babies ,
have and
, that does n't it
makes it
things in the animal kingdom different
we might decide what 's proper and what is n't ,
but that 's the way it is for them .
kind of
that 's it .
survival of the fittest or something
if the baby 's strong enough , because it can
from them
not really .
try .
of instruments a
is
, never thought about that
was thinking and
it is funny how many names have been used all over the country .
tell me what kind of books have you read ?
college for the last four years to
text books
was going to say , not fun kind ?
i love to read about real people
to me , half the time it is fascinating more than some of these made .
it is ,
it really is truly
it happened .
that was real good .
, is like you
not a biography heavy
used to like to read a lot about royalty
my thing for
and there was a murder .
it was some time ago .
seems like it was the spy went
it sounds like fun .
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names .
wonder if it were by one of those famous writers
believe it was in fact
sounds like something
, because someone had given it to me ,
, and will be great
and it was .
her books interesting really
always sell and well .
it to life
, known
our stars movie
our stars movie
because it is totally different concept to us .
either read a lot
read mostly novels
and it was one of those novels generation
and they continue through generations
like always
like and
have
is n't ?
she is
do n't like to get one of her books
because , just to read live .
'll skip everything just to get back
up one night until two in the morning
, do n't know
how often do she come out with them .
have been in school back
she writes the same thing .
she can
and they are the same silly things ,
if it is over and over practically the same thing .
never read a whole one of hers
she is
's criticizing her ,
n't like to have her money
she has and millions of them .
and then make movies out of some of them .
have not seen as many of hers
hers
and they 're , because she quotes a lot
think she does a lot of research , too
too
like some of these popular writers out
her books incredible just
, do you
, do n't think so
, have n't you
thought about it really just now
maybe it 's because they take in so much .
do n't know
for the average person to go and through them sit just too
they are so big
it would be like another gone with the wind ,
another three hour
that , and maybe people turns off
look at gone with the wind , but
known
it 's about one of my favorite movies .
it had such a bad press ,
was n't too
was going to say
was
when it was route on the
when it came out and then was just how bad
me , either .
do you know what is read anyone ?
of anybody who is either , read it
it would n't
about the weather .
very appropriate , i guess
you ready for this ?
just a moment
what ,
we talk about the weather
the weather this time of year been kind of unusual
of days the last
do n't know
fly for a living

'll tell you that
so .
the systems have been real out strong
are so and
is
for
for
fantastic .
is that right ?
with all this kind of weather it makes it kind of dangerous for you .
would n't danger call it
this is n't really bad stuff to fly around in .
guess so
the air systems reasonably calm
a little bit of
but it 's not like it is in the spring time .
we moved from another location down here , actually
are the right word for them
me pardon ?
is a good word for them
it 's amazing .
it where there is not a cloud in the sky ,
the rain , and is n't falling
going across the sky and back and forth horizontally
what a light show and
it is
cloud to cloud it can be really sensational here .
that 's true .
you from
from salt lake city area
and there 's always a lot of snow .
about an hour 's drive from seven to major twelve different ski resorts up we
there was an awful lot of snow , and so
so , we have a great time .
you near the park cities area were .
beautiful area
several times through it
lot of

when there is n't good on a movie , too .
have of
, have a baby

do n't even remember
were back in college
it was general hospital or something

of their soap opera the
funny ,

so
do watch that one

sometimes that i watching
think he has some interesting things on it
, known
what time , is that on
never
it 's on at four .
's home then , not
do n't see
watch
, do n't know
there are some real weird that people , he seems to come up with .
by other people that
he does have some real bizarre things .
, other than that , so .
what is that ?
it was n't a real good topic for us ,
me but
snow on
snow on
that 's nice .
wish it would snow
we have broken all sorts of records .
we still have some highways
just , but
all the time on the news
until you 've seen really , but it does n't hit you really .
it was amazing .
been
there 's been a lot ,
it 's too bad
but the thing is this happens ,
it is in the last three years
but the people continue to move back in the flood zones .
so do n't know
you got to wonder how long they 're going to keep doing that for .
do n't
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood .
what a mess
,
this been an interesting thing to do
a lot of calls
maybe to five people
my husband , are doing it too
a few more than me to
but it 's been interesting and real kind of fun .
pay for these
five dollars .
a call five dollars ?
could do that
we ca n't
you do it
so what kind of home repair work have you to do ?
we have a lot of wind around here
up , or just until the rain loosening them
saw on the news
but you 're getting good a bit of the rain , though still .
we did have yesterday a little bit of rain .
have n't so far
, should be getting up there to look
but have
so that
they are wood shake .
that should be a lot of fun .
originally put them up
we just bought the house last year ,
recently had just start looking at it myself
so , it is a small problem so far ,
of it
what kind of roof do you 've ?
campus apartment buildings with
then you do n't have to do with it too much .
not too much
have you got pretty well pitch on that roof ,
it or are pretty steep ?
it 's pretty steep .
parts of it
i
i
that would be just too much of a fall for me .
, was the house reasonably new
you doing some remodeling work on it
it 's just twelve years old , now actually .
yet that 's pretty new house .
but just take good care of it .
we have with this house
that sounds like a lot of fun .
you think it 's stopped ,
them up and then patch
what is it
it 's all drywall
drywall .
framing wood ?
do but manage to show these little cracks
do n't know how that work quite
maybe it is n't drywall .
really do n't know
think it 's
that 's what it is ,
a hard on the drywall
think that 's the way this is done
that 's good .
the previous owner have a major problem with it
you do have any children ?
about how you ?
, have three
so we kind of got different ball game
do you feel like you have any time , spend with them ?
they do n't want to spend with their parents any time
that 's true .
when they get older , you actually spend less time with them , of course ,
but it is still really important , of course , .
is a librarian
i work and two nights a week at the senior library high school .
they keep open for kids to do their work it
hire and then an aide to work
my son 's my aide .
that 's nice .
two nights a week for
are you
and there are usually not very much business .
some nights it is
your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part
have sort of a captive audience , so
really do so spend more time with him than most probably
's away from other my son those hours , too , but of course
but his dad are pretty much that time at home .
so that kind of gives him , and then time with his dad
that 's true ,
him a little bit of that individual time
but it 's
the most important thing to be
that 's right .
my five year
and she is not every day at school she thinks and play
it is kind of hard .
it 's hard ,
not take the
are worried about
needs the kitchen
this need to be done ,
and it 'll still be there tomorrow .
that 's true .
but is that kind of hard to do .
it 's hard to do ,
if you 're kind of what like a person
then think it 's hard
think of the nice things about holidays one is that it does give you the opportunity to spend more time with family
slow down a little bit
we 're not this year , and
and it 's nice really just because we can do the things .
more than
that 's right .
this is the first year we 're staying home too
think it 's going to be real quiet and
but that 's an opportunity to get out the games
usually
of course .
but , he 's got a lot of those hard kind every now and then
and he wants to be an engineering ,
all that kind of
we have the training and ,
so he , sat down
we would put it under the tree
would n't take apart
would n't take apart after that it
that 'd be kind of fun .
those kinds of things never happen
would take in a family
people sitting in
while you 're doing
that 's right .
should n't say
be very hard for me to sit down and watch without doing something all the way through a program , but
me too
to watch very much of it at all
because
how can you watch that
kind of
it 's best on the show ,
do n't know
a little bit out
really
and so that was nice .
like driving because of the scenery to different cities ,
that was so nice .
the states except
how far do you usually end up driving
you 're
that 's quite a ways .
it is .
but it was
but , there are lots of fun places to see .
that 's true .
is that
you like to get up in mountains
you do have any mountains nearby ?
is n't it ?
vacation what have
it 's pretty fun .
there 's a lot to do up there .
it 's pretty busy , though ,
you have to like crowds .
what is it ?
it 's a huge amusement park ,
they have slides water
and it 's just a big , big tourist attraction .
are all little shops and candy shops
and , it 's
do n't think there hardly anybody lives ,
because it 's just kind of tourists .
in itself , kind of a city probably ?
it 's a place summer mostly .
summer place
how far away is it ?
that is so nice .
it 's a pretty ride up there , too .
it 's really pretty .
it 's nice out there .
things there look at
kind of
and of real pretty things
our climate 's real
where 's that ?
the land 's pretty
's
is on the phone
and it is fine ,
it 's nice .
it uh 's lot different kind of .
and it 's a real there than different land and scenery .
it is kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that .
and they are
kind of fun places
the lake goes on , and
and that is too real pretty over there .
too me
me too
is going warm for the winter somewhere
that 'd be nice .
only the things that
it 's been because of the size or some problem like that .
had because they did n't perform the way they were supposed to return things
they have a pretty good guarantee , most
and it takes them less than a day
and they are in one way or another broken .
maybe those type of products should be for kids older .
your children
have a five and a half and a three and half a year old that play with them
and do n't think they are unduly rough ,
maybe they but .
do n't know
and broken easily
third , fourth , fifth grade
for very long before she was out of it , she was n't so in it
but do n't remember her breaking a lot of stuff
n't
do n't remember lots of little pieces , but also
they 've got so many different things with it now .
that is one thing
the arm were broken and less than a week later .
but they were real good about replacing it .
, that is that they are real good about replacing it
they should n't have broken
almost any way
any direction
a grip on it like a bigger kid
that was about it .
that was about it .
the main thing
is that right ?
do you see there 's a big problem with electronic things ?
not really .
that much problem with
they last
we do n't , when , in fact
you do n't need them
just an added tack on
a lot of the credit
if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time , if
so it seems like it 's a waste of money .
if you 're going to have problems with it , it is usually before that warranty would expire
the first one
an extended warranty for
and used it never
you never even needed it .
so it seems and ridiculous .
they do go out , it are either something
or it means it is old enough that it 's time to replace the whole thing .
it 's time to replace it .
these extended warranties
, too , .
a lot of it
it was and ridiculous .
a pretty good price for them , too , you and .
they are a pretty healthy prices ,
'll need this
my husband finally put his foot down just
do n't know
he said and we 're not going to buy ,
you got your worth out of it probably anyway .
so we really , have been fairly happy with things
but now that we take good of things care
and we do n't run out and buy either a lot of things .
and are not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken since anymore
of the brands you buy
you look at the consumer guide .
and go around
have a motor home
rough type ?
motor homes can be a lot of fun .
really .
really .
enjoyed it
go visit the national parks and state parks and get out and see nature , just
that can be a lot of fun , too .
about how you ?
how great .
it was
nights was enough to cool where they are comfortable .
the days was nice and warm and
and , it was beautiful , beautiful few days .
that 's great .
it worked out , especially considering she was six months pregnant particularly well .
, so do n't know
it pretty well worked .
quick and easy to put up
and packs away small
that 's true ,
that 's true .
it was a lot of fun .
be beautiful territory
it is gorgeous ,
the big trees
just the driving up the coast line
then cut over
it is gorgeous , though .
what ,
that 's my first trip back in thirty years , but maybe .
it be
of some of those trees the
n't
was the tree
it came down
but , .
there are lots of further pretty west country .
we are hoping that one of these days soon after we 're out .
quickly out
because there are lots to see .
and is real pretty , in a different sort of way
i
would
's partial to big tree country
think it 's called a job ,
do n't know
a whole lot of forestry down there , there is not ?
not around here
not around here
lot of
took three weeks
three weeks .
were actually a little more than three weeks on the road and
then the whole family was this on in ?
.
that would have to be a blast .
it was really ,
it was great .
what ,
my favorite team
is that
lot easier than it was a couple years ago ,
but they have .
you did get watch it ?
did n't
have been at my computer all day
a fan cowboy
used to be a big cowboy real fan
it is kind of hard to be a cowboy fan , though not .
they always have been my favorite .
still have a soft spot
is that the coach who 's leading them
they are in the playoffs ?
to the playoffs
they won like just one game
and pretty so fast turnaround .
they made this year to playoffs , but
today and was the first game
so everybody 's really going crazy down here .
bet
they are going crazy ,
they turned around it , so
but they have a lot of young exciting players , now
but now it 's like they 're doing good
everybody is so forgotten about that .
the fickle most people in the world
and it is the coach ' fault ,
let
good season , the coach can first
.
they have a young team .
it is the same old players
so , now it 's like a taste of something different .
they are not all mister nice guys like they used to be .
now it 's tough and dirty team
everybody is so
who is the competition going to be ?
but already .
like we can go all the way to the super bowl ,
we play every game away
it 's going to be tough ,
beat already this year
we and
but we should beat them .
everybody feel like we should be able to beat them
everything is so , looking real good .
and it could be out there than the one we played a totally new almost team .
on a roll
six or seven in a row
the hottest team in
they are playing in fact tonight .
tell ,
they have much of a team this year
they 're doing good tonight .
are
have n't been watching
they are winning .
good for us
that 's right , and
about that
he went ?
but , the cowboys did good today .
was
they would get beat today because they are so young ,
playoffs
looking presently
bought one just as a matter of fact
just bought one
just within the last three weeks
what did you get ?
was wondering where that came from
it sounds like it ,
but it is n't really .
, of course , it
usually ,
sometimes
but it 's a car brand ,
have but really
just drives
it 's so quiet ,
the engine is running .
big their selling
but seems to be the quiet ride
it 's really .
it 's got pretty good acceleration , too .
c a player in it
so can play those
, feature , was it
but there is not very many options on that car .
there are only about five or six options .
everything else is
think that are already on most of them ,
this is probably suspension tied into the brakes .
for in the ice and snow driving
snow does n't happen very often .
, people are what this stuff
we got a pretty fair amount of snow .
you have some there .
the first down winter here was the worst winter they 'd seen in twenty years , and probably
known
came just to get in their vehicles gas and get the oil in
and the roof moon 's also an option .
most of them
but really is only about a half a dozen things
and everything else is
in that real cold car
it 's a deal package .
that on
those two together sold
, have so there to take to do it , you
wanted a c d or not
that was pretty much and it .
and like they had .
they did n't order anything but the extra luxury version of what they got .
imagine , or not ,
that in the dealership
a business
run through my business , just
sitting in your living room .
it 's really ,
?
adjustable power
what do you think about the school system ?
think they are having a lot of trouble right now
my son , goes to a private school
big public schools by definition city having a tough time now probably from budget cuts and everything else
why you did choose a private school ?
move at a pace along a little faster
public school
has he ?
then how he does like it ?
he is
he is a senior high school in this year
so he 's been there all the time .
he is done it the whole twelve and so many years
and it 's been really good for him .
how big of a school
, but in the upper grades , four about four hundred and something on campus about twelve hundred
maybe so it 's a hundred per grade .
a hundred per grade , that 's a good size .
it 's really .
we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture
and he is really well done ,
that 's good .
he was ahead just at an early age and
was still a pull out one day program and even in the fourth grade where they started
just and did n't think that was going
could he push ahead every day
are you just
is just , starting her ,
seems to me , but away with murder
the teachers and
they have and
known
that 's a big problem .
that students do n't seem to show that respect
of crossing a teacher when we was in school
would n't
'll now stand there
you would n't .
think that 's wrong and
think we need get back to show some respect
warrant that
used to be , basic respect for elders and adults particularly in responsible positions , but
for other people
with little on your hands brats
is that
our society 's just stopped talking out ,
just this generation 's kind , or changed a little bit of
the world , changes
obviously , not as they used to be so .
a whole lot more things to
a whole lot more variety of
life is not as simple as it was at one time , maybe so
and just do n't
what that is n't just coming through is it .
we used to have to wear dresses
, did n't you
you go to dresses ,
it was and polyester
and it had
and it was when get down on the floor
we here up and
and it 's no more than so many inches above the knee .
so it 's
it 's really kind of gone the rounds ,
you kind of act
what does probably have done with it ,
this school your son goes to do they ,
put some shelves in
some odd stuff around the house and
hobby more than
about how
like to think of it as a hobby ,
repairing things around the house just
they needed a few years ago some shelves book
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make
and it actually pretty well worked
those plans and over the years .
and is very good at making shelves book
just going out in the garage and we
'll have to come and see
that sounds like a good idea .
that 's right , and
because it is out of necessity ,
sometimes think , but also
like to get to work out
and sound like you got some real nice tools , too .
do you think you would be able to do some more if you have more tools and different tools ?
little by little
started out with just hand basic tools and kind that of added on things to
a type entertainment
well because it works , and
and that 's pretty well worked .
or
is aware of that
that 's right .
that 's right .
that is so good .
that 's good .
but what is a good saw table next
it takes less room up .
the wood down
the saw and .
but
a table saw does take a lot of space
partly now that 's my problem .
do n't have room for this
where we lived before up north basements was common
used to put in my basement all the stuff , and
they do n't have basements .
's from up
and ,
there is no basements down here
a dedicated room for that
too that the equipment
, do n't know
, so do n't know
and think the main thing is , like you say
days to days
and it is a great stress reliever .
school in
for chairs tables
have and
think about child care
on it is my feelings
you know
probably
you would n't take them to a day-care ?
too many kids and too many infections and things coming in
, do n't know
all the things
is sure that there is some good ones ,
it was a preschool day-care type of thing .
liked it , but some ways
and did n't
think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important
how was it
think they have two teachers
think there were twenty kids , and
have her going two days , but only
most of the other kids and was going more days
she went ,
they teach her to write her name ,
her wrist not all the way in a natural form
she did ?
she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff .
around all the way
had n't and
she was four or three ,
it was last year
and then got to work with the kids on the thing from the school things says
had n't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that
they 'd never picked out , though it ?
or just never said anything .
took her two days a week
my main reason for taking her was just social skills more than anything else .
did n't just feel like she was enough socially mature
at a day-care where they are taken care
you do n't know
, is a different thing
, do n't know
it 's so hard to take anywhere for very long young kids .
think it 's hard to leave them ,
it is .
it is .
the ones it 's not , older
really because even have any real worries
usually pretty well and they
it 's hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will just .
kind of their schedules
and if you know .
people have young kids
, do n't know
think then on the other hand
it 's hard to keep always yourself feeling like you 're doing something productive ,
your house still feel like it 's a mess , and at
and you 've got anything to do n't
what is
's kind of hard to always feel
the work never ends .
that 's for sure .
it does n't .
just think that it would be hard to do that full time
or is everything okay .
universal health insurance
that 's right .
what you 're thinking
what we would like to say
that is about
the paper today about
in the morning times ?
did not
least this morning according to the article in the paper
is something we all need
is it
you have to have some form of health insurance .
extremely expensive , though
, everyone if you will say they think everyone have a right to health care
and do n't yet
that 's the thing ,
the ones that currently pay and pay the for health insurance premiums paying for
somehow subsidize it in
you have health insurance ?
.
through your company ?
through my company ,
off from a position as a sales manager of a company
my wife developed and cancer .
we did n't have any insurance .
that must have been hard .
because , it was very good .
it 's not free ,
because , it was paid by the county
it is affordable ?
did so you have a good experience .
had a bad experience as it turned out
your wife 's better , i hope ?
she passed away .
is
that 's all right .
that happens .
it does happen ,
but it 's very sad .
is in any event , but
is so
actually is a pediatrician
is that right ?
it is
my mom and worked for the county health department
come to our school and check our teeth
when my children were growing up , and we did n't have that .
to paying for it
have the money to pay for it ,
but is
up so much
, do n't know
it is interesting ,
did not know that .
so one out of every three children have nothing to reimburse them for their health care .
and it is
, then
what do you think about it ?
think it 's a real good concept
drug testing procedures would have to be refined .
have seen on the news , there is
did n't realize that
a drug up in their , test
but they did n't know for sure what it was ,
but it was a drug ,
they got so
people getting somebody and
that 's right ,
remember when what they call it , sort of like a positive , negatives or some kind of word they use
and then there 's an error every now
their rights and their rights
so
everyone coming
did three years ago
everyone goes through the drug testing procedure coming in
as for better and better
we did , in
once you 're in they continue to do it ,
you 're always on called for it
they about a year and a half ago and instituted a , drug and testing alcohol program .
each employee comes as in part of a blood test is the hiring procedure .
think , but the big problem is , though they send these large off to labs
and then they have thousands and thousands of samples going through it in a day
bottles and get up , things like that .
it 's a good idea ,
need the drug testing procedures
working for the company for
good company
and all that
that was a great place to work .
it 's good news .
in with them you can start buying stock
can a pretty fair amount of stock but
that 's what my brother was telling me .
that 's good deal .
have n't done in a couple months this
supposed to discuss
you are supposed to get five minutes .
we got a couple minutes , i guess , then more .
i think what else can say about that .
see 's
everyone coming in goes through the drug test .
asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
me think about that
have already
you get
you come in the first , then
ca n't remember
already be working here in the first week of the drug test
maybe it was during the interview .
come up for an interview , a couple times
was when all that happened
the drug test
is so sure that happened to me , too
was there already working
they were n't and testing of those who were already working any .
we have couple times a year rain
that then than other
especially the last few years
a drought out there has n't it ,
have n't been any this year
yet .
yet .
still , could come
getting again
long a cold season as
it 's so hard to predict here .
lots of times
it 's not bad out there today .
it 's nice .
came from outside just in
and it 's really pretty .
kind is it
so , and it is
round year camp
that is interesting .
but it is different definitely .
of summers here a
have
and they are
it gets
it is to me
it is .
.
central valley
even dry , but pretty climate , so that was n't was it ?
it 's very dry there .
it 's pretty hot in the summer .
four weeks for a good three , we have over a hundred degrees .
but it 's a dry heat .
everybody , when you have a hundred here , are dying hundred .
known
that 's a tropical climate and
and it really feel similar to this during the summer .
or was just that vacation or something ?
the bible into
modern versions into other languages
have anything written
this is the first thing that is written down so
are an alphabet
that is interesting .
you do n't think about that as a normal career , when you are thinking of things that people might be doing .
are it
you are so with the home now office .
right now
that 's what brought me here ,
does the weather change fast
a few times a year
but there is an awful lot of too good weather in between .
,
.
thought the fall was really nice
usually a lot of the spring months after the last freeze and nice really
and that 's
a lot of
quite a bit of that
are out there than it is here , and it
have not to serve in the theater
however , my rolling support in the service was support those in the theater of operation .
ago the contracts that we made needed
it over a whole lot
my personal thoughts
and we managed to come out all the way around losers .
deciding to get out of the role of world policeman
your views
and they were in a civil war one with another , as it turned out
us now
so , we have to deal with the situation as we played it .
me started on those people .
just do n't want to do with her any more anything ,
your government
right or wrong ?
right or wrong ,
do n't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong ,
some type of deal like that
one moment .
fascinating .
for the delay .
is that
was
and do n't think everybody know the whole situation
n't
and we did n't do a whole lot better .
they have colonies there or something
that was the old french colony ,
in a bind you get
we do n't want to play any more
missed it
.
was probably just three or four years ,
what kind of foods would you 've ?
like
, too , .
be for
you ca n't enjoy it .
and so do n't
it is ,
and it is ,
got famous for college in
ca n't give you a recipe really
you 'd just do it .
can do it just
like doing that kind of stuff
and it is fun ,
we have a bunch of over people just
like that
too , in fact
is planning for people tomorrow night and then the next night dinner
one thing we 've done just , because it 's real easy , quite a bit through the holidays actually is just baked dinners potato
and have three or four couples
that is fun .
but it 's inexpensive
and you got a great dinner .
that 's a good idea .
it 's real easy ,
like doing that part
because we 've got three or four couples we got together with to play games , up
invariably we end up at my house since .
then can say just
,
,
,
we are done .
and it 's pretty cool .
that 's good .
one of my favorites are to make chicken and rice .
you do n't like it
.
,
a really easy
and then you put ,
put in mushrooms if
how
every once in
is not a big wine real person
like , but
it adds something to the chicken .
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice .
'll keep in mind that one
would be sort of elegant kind
or .
see 's
what was it ,
three quarters of cup of rice
you can vary it really .
ca n't remember
on for rice
flavor .
that would be good .
's see
think it was an hour
have done it in the microwave so often lately because , it 's really easy
too a lot , .
think it 's about an hour , but
how long it would be in the microwave ?
or maybe it 's only half hour .
the brown chicken to get it
or you do
goes a little faster
this is a beneficial call .
like
liked your idea too , there
but that one is an easy one .
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup , and the wine
've got a year old and four a year old two
it and .
because my daughter calls it her gravy
and she thinks
you do now have any pets ?
n't right now
grew
always had a dog and a cat , some , birds
but we do n't have anything right now .
about what you ?
we always have been at a place where we 'd have to go away for the summer or something
and it was
getting a dog if
we can take care of it , and everything .
would just
and , about what you all ?
right now , is a student
and campus housing does not allow even thinking about that .
we got almost
is that right ?
they are
pets and things but ?
i love animals .
was almost never cat at least one in the house
cats in the house

we like ,
them , and everything like that but .

right 's at my hometown .
that is interesting .
really in the country so it is , up really
so guess .
.
it 's pretty nice country up there ?
it is beautiful .
hills or what ?
there are individuals growing their own food .
it more in the way of sheep and cattle most of the agriculture .
that 's mostly and even small time .
the biggest chunk of
it 's mines coal and chemical plants and power plants .
aluminum plants
there are two aluminum plants .
computer

up my fourth semester
i hope that work well out .
it 's a big change .
you did ?
you 've got some experience behind you in the work force .
it hope is a good program there .
it hope is a good program there .
consider a pretty good program
but it 's
that 's good .
probably a good student teacher ratio and things and
most pretty small
real well that works out .
get if you were move into an apartment or a house somewhere ,
what would you get ?
towards the larger dogs
had before we moved on campus
they be a lot of fun
bet .
our you topic
pets .
you 've got it .
you do
.
have a dog that soon be eight years old ,
and we have a cat , which is about five years old .
about how you guys ?
two birds at
three dogs .
what kind of birds do you 've ?
enjoy them ?
have a ball with them
and you let them fly and everything around them
my dogs
and if you 're a lover bird ,
and never thought about my fault and up .
right out of the air
we have
my son had the bird back in his room ,
, was his bird
a fan ceiling up
the bird got away from him one afternoon , and
and that sucker , went flying up against the wall
, so much for the bird
it killed him ?
he is
it killed ours ,
we did n't have it high enough or he did n't get hit in just the right spot ,
but it threw him against the wall , up
and he slid down the wall .
you , my kids older , both of them now
to be seven and a half in length feet and that thing , grew
.
because my wife , and finally got .
, my son went to school ,
my son needed some money , but
made him a deal , so
otherwise is going to give it to other this man
that 's pretty good .
that was sort of fun ,
tell because my wife 's a real pet lover this story
many times my wife , would be there lying on the sofa
of her body with his head right on her neck the
but the cat would be on the back of the sofa ,
a dog and would be running around crazy .
through the mail
do n't do that , because they wo n't come in my house
when he was in junior high school , someone gave it to him
and it was just a small then thing ,
but it got to be pretty big ,
small mice to big rats and things like that
it 's just too much .
watch our cat
always told my wife your friend is going to get our cat one of these days
that 's wild .
neither me
outside , far away from me
we are now down to a simple dog and cat ,
that 's the way it should be , and
birds .
they so expensive
was my son
and is
away from
are
and he picked him out
have literally off shake him to get him in the cage ,
he tried to bite me for two years
become wonderful friends
now he talks
is that
is the only one who pay attention to him
and is a substitute teacher
we have too many pets .
me about it
when they saw one they knew the sucker .
you heard the question ,
what do you like to do for yourself in automobile repairs car ?
'll tell you ,
do when a lot more repairs
the easy stuff
i change
'll and change and do filters air , that kind of stuff
as much as
used to do more a whole lot , but not any more ,
they are just too weird to work on now .
, is not the reason you 're doing it
you do n't have time to do it
that is part of it
part of it is , like you said , .
do anything but put gasoline , in my car
but have you had any major repairs recently ?
have got now on this car
had a van before , but
and it was only two years old ,
it had transmission and go out on it .
should you feel very fortunate .
'll and
maybe should have just traded in the car
it makes you sometimes wonder .
have a very comfortable car
need a large comfortable car
have a new transmission , so
almost me the same amount
it hurts
you did to a dealership take it ?
.
by a neighbor
that 's the only thing , and
.
are it
it is running ,
is it
known
it 's certainly frightening .
what work
work in the networking area .
the southwest medical
a lot of people down there that could help me with my car ,
but they are all too busy .
have the other way to do it ,
and that is to find someone and pay them to do it .
so certainly hope you have a nice new year
is planning on it
it ca n't be any worse than last year ,
that 's for sure .
it could be ,
but do n't think so much
that 's true ,
that 's true .
we 're starting a new one out ,
so is to make it a good one .
is going to try and plan on it
enjoyed the conversation
thank you .
thank you .
do you live in a home ?
now about two and a half years ago
you did ?
first house
in ours for about six years
we have
and it 's first our home , too .
we were before we built our home managing some apartments that we , were living in
and that was quite an experience .
having my own home , just the space and more privacy and
it 's a fairly large house ?
that 's pretty good size .
it is a story two .
it 's tiny .
it is small ?
it 's not much bigger .
was as big as this house
you do have children ?
just one .
just one .
the rooms all but
use for an office that are handy an extra one and
'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one i guess
rather , have lots of rooms and lots of space
but that costing me ends up .
does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood ?
it 's pretty typical ,
it 's a very , very middle class neighborhood .
is sure virtually in the neighborhood , that everybody 's first their homes
lots of kids and stuff and
, fits well in the neighborhood it so and
it 's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood ,
on the other hand , but .
it seems
or is it ?
but our neighborhood had just a wide variety of , people
older people here and
we 're in our thirties .
and there 's a lot of kids .
people across the street have eight .
eight kids ?
just last summer their home burned matter of fact , down
is they just and
and their house is going to be really big .
, to be sure , with eight
they are building a lot bigger .
it 's quite different than it was before ,
and it 's a lot bigger .
but ours is ,
it 's a nice home ,
it is definitely not one of the smaller ones ,
and it is not the biggest either .
they be especially in newer tiny real neighborhoods
my brother built just a new house .
fought the neighborhood and actually on it , because the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
his house , and actually ended up
but they were pretty touchy on it .
he was
have those architectural codes here
on the story on the back and then two part
where our chimney , was one
the chimney , was just going to be brick and
they wanted to have more brick and us ,
it does
have all brick
we could n't afford it
but , it 's funny that you 'd say , because there were homes in here that did n't have any brick at all .
depends of
ours is on the street last they built .
they are of a nicer little bit gone
they have ,
it is the second phase
a little bit so they 've kind and
why they stuck with brick more when there were homes that did n't have any other us
the builder plans to do and
a very control tightly upscale and very codes and stuff
they come back in , and then
do you ?
it 's about six months old ,
living in an apartment
so , we do n't have a yard ,
inside it stay
a difficult time train it
how old is it ?
it 's about six months .
but they are supposed to be real intelligent dogs ,
do n't know if that have anything to do with the intelligence
had dogs through the years
right now have got two and three cats ,
we watched it for two to three months , and this summer
was n't and
and an intelligent dog
what is the best method ?
do n't know
is
they say that 's not the way to do it now .
catch in the act them .
we are ever hardly at home ,
it 's so kind of difficult ,
you do n't want to do ,
it gets frustrating when you take it outside
and then it runs right inside
it does
it and do it .
and when it is outside play
a lot of times ,
and it wo n't
it comes and inside .
have you praised maybe when it do something outside it and a treat give it ?
have
and there are certain in the house where he , like to go spots
plants and all that on
that is nothing .
'll soon on
and she is gone the other way ,
because she is so old , she does n't have much control
are we so
that 's sad .
and she still feel good .
but she 's got a great appetite ,
she knows and we are there , by smell .
how old is it ?
that 's sad .
and
because she 's been our friend for all these years , we do anything
of course not .
so we 're putting up with all her accidents ,
could n't
two nights ago , she had diarrhea ,
and so that was a bad one .
that 's really sad .
what 's the deal ,
we take on it
this feel really tug on it and so dog .
it goes just like a mad dog ,
do it .
signed this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes
some bad things about some of those
sometimes misuse their
them bad
my daughter , were living at home then
and , it 's a pretty good class ,
she is just pretty ,
she is not smart .
so , she did n't learn a lot ,
it calm , down a little bit
to being around dogs other now
how long it did take ?
think it was a program six weeks
every , what ?
think it was a week for six weeks one night ,
it was a class group , and outside .
it was fairly reasonable , too .
they 're really nervous
if , and they are
what kinds of activities
so he spend time .
he 's a real sports kind of person ,
so he plays tennis with the kids .
tennis as a family
what the baby play in the playground .
we take turns with her .
see 's
we have a computer
a lot of things with the kids on the computer and .
let
and my husband sometimes with that join them .
and to do with her that
and the older kids will join in and listen to a story
he got home from work or
once and in a one while he 'll read the story to little ,
but that is basically my job .
you do
it or are pretty natural ?
it is .
of your day the
and is that kind of cutting into your time .
with the kids and getting older , now on the weekends they get
but on the older ones two to get .
upstairs go at nine
and will go out to dinner and come home not too late
and spend some time with him
but it 's really hard .
you do work during the day ?
do n't work
that was two days a week ,
and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot .
do n't
but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house .
can imagine
that is another thing , and
'll take on the weekend usually
that 's kind of a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son , and
try to do things like that , so
and then they have a pretty too busy social calendar , of course
you fit in with all that .
think it 's very , very easy to fall into that trap ,
a tape and of is not totally innocent .
that 's good .
families facing a challenge
what ,
of years the next
it 's very hard to cut back when
have a friend is a nurse
she can pick her hours and
that 's a great career .
i i wish would have gone into nursing .
because she has such a flexible schedule ,
but it 's very hard to spend time with the children and your husband and do everything at once .
think it 's a big , responsibility
, you have so that you can continue when you were single the lifestyle you have children
when you have children , you have to say , this are different
and you do have to give up things .
the first two years of
once every five years
once every five years ?
you 've got a pretty big family .
that 's the hardest part about getting the stuff together and
and you ?
we have a pretty big family ,
everybody 's most right in that area .
that makes it a easier lot .
only once every five or ten years
always because it 's hard to get everyone that together .
it was on my grandmother 's birthday ,
but she is now gone .
that 's kind of what happened with ours .
we have one in a long time
so , to make you .
you do just all start planning real far ahead of time ?
you do all start planning real far ahead of time ?
there are kind of a set pattern to it .
we got together , at the park
everybody and bring lots of food
eat a lot .
because it 's a lot harder for us
and so we 've really to plan so that everyone can start their vacation time , a year probably ahead of time .
vacation time
.
have at tops to get there and back
have a bit longer ways to go than most so
you make also them but
both in school
so that makes it kind of tough .
they have been just after the summer semester starts happening .
you ca n't really get away .
usually .
we managed to get to one .
started school
and she took off that summer .
kind of
have been home to see
my grandfather is the only one that are still around .
and my grandmother is
she was like the glue ,
i
where 's home for you ?
but it 's harder for everyone get home .
you can find a more central location maybe this year .
the majority of them like just how you said in close quarters
within a couple drive hours
plan it and every thing
say just and up on the phone
or do you all mail out stuff ?
that 's pretty much it .
it 's going to be such and such weekend
all you come and .
that 's about it .
and this is the standard pattern .
everybody bring their favorite dish
had seen in ten years over probably not
it was
and is no
is
known
i married cousin your 's brother 's uncle or something like that .
you do have every year them ?
every year .
is so interesting our
you do have kids ?
got three
about how
we have two and another one on the way .
you 've got then young children .
,
we have a year old six .
he is
that 's great .
what kind of mix do you 've ?
a boy , and a girl ?
two boys .
two boys .
two boys .

we find out really even
do not blame you
we like .
we will take either .
we 've got boys two and a girl also .
we 've got boys two and a girl .
the two boys first
maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time .
maybe ,
we kind of like , though too
he is in the navy .
he is a lieutenant in the navy
is the navy and
he is a biologist wildlife ,
she is in the seventh grade .
you kind of got a span , there
she 's into a little bit of everything .
she loves riding horses
as much as she can
you do have horses ?
just , she knows people who do ,
do she ?
she must really like them .
peace group
do n't know if you 've got into that with your kids ,
a program for
advance .
have
our little boy 's in the first grade
school and for six years .
so do know about that program
are my wife
and , she kind of that heads up for these kids
and they got , last year .
they did not win that ,
but they got one local and one region ,
and they got a new mix of kids this time .
so , it keeps them busy .
it keeps them busy .
i bet
do so she
special classes for peace classes
this year 's history who is their class peace .
enjoy that kind of stuff
how
so .
,
something to do
as far as our activities , .
you will get to different levels .
.
my husband is going to take our six year .
that will be fun .
both boy things
we do n't really ski .
have not
of course , the baby 's young ,
got to wait a couple years
sledding , is that
the what ?
we 've done that .
in fact , he goes right just out here .
we 've got quite a bit of snow ,
we got a lot last week .
keep that
you would like that ,
have plenty of snow ,
it 's really fun .
it is fun .
you do not have to drive in it
do not like that
really , it makes me nervous .
plenty of
do n't
do n't
it off of here
, do n't mind it
but the winter gets long .
for it to start getting spring , come about
and , it 's too early yet .
you 've got five months before you will see .
,
.
they have been too bad , not .
come about march , it gets
are usually to hear the news
the news ,
but do n't think of that every day , even
get them
we do n't get a paper
a college class
the library has a paper .
a break on in
the radio on
or someone else , he gets home
get from all over
every day
the newspaper and magazines , anything
a lot
is really up on current affairs
the news and everything
what 's your favorite news ,
do you get a news magazine
is not getting any news magazines
of coverage the
do n't know
there is anything missing ?
it is kind of hard to know .
and do n't know ,
to compare it
tell , whatever they
is satisfied
they are covering supposedly everything that happens ,
you know .
through the grapevine
ever do n't hear it in the news here
it 's so slight ,
they do n't even bother putting it in the paper
even if there 'll be a small article in the paper about it
that 's what sells papers .
that 's because there is a high crime rate .
that 's been like that since the first newspaper .
is sure
but do n't know
, is satisfied
what basis of comparison
that 's true .
certainly we get enough coverage .
we can get news ,
because it 's all so bad
it is
so .
we have to keep talking , i guess .
we can end
it 's really ?
have
we 're not
, do n't know
we are supposed to wait
or do n't know
we were supposed to talk
and it was really funny ,
it , made ,
and it happened to be my friend who live a few blocks away .
were we
we do n't really but
took so that
just and then we talked about .
interesting .
some topics ,
their sources of information
if they 're satisfied , and then
that 's , and really about it .
it 's hard to talk for on this five minutes .
you 'll hear report one
like to play golf
where do you play in this area golf ?
that are usually
you do ride
or you do
.
at the same time .
, that could be difficult
sometimes ride
sometimes and pull
for the exercise we like , just a lot of the times to walk .
better play in
do n't
think that might be true
, known
and that make me so
it 's not going to do much that damage to the course ,
but apparently thought .
do n't play over there
the course
because , they do n't allow you to pull a cart
a cart the damages
a hundred dollars
cause it is half price
is so that
we 've got our card cause .
could use a card too
do you ?
near the golf course
time next
it 's just like a bus card
just and they
it got through ten on it one
just for you it and .
have so
you must have a son .
scout boy age
that sounds like fun too .
still right at the beginning age
be six to eight years before
and take out on the course with you
that 's right .
lessons expensive , though ,
you can teach them .
they probably would make it never then
took only when lessons for golf
ever have taken really lessons golf
was a scenario group and
took lesson one
try to make the club hit the ball just
known
do n't want to play strike out
have fun doing it , but
have some good shots and some bad shots
you work in the gardens too
you do have special flowers ?
flower gardens
so , those ought to be coming up spring time around .
she put them two months ago .
have with all the cold weather
they do great .
is that
do or anything them
they do really good
had some out before
it and
but they come back later .
did n't do anything to them
they good to plant in the winter time
they last then for a long time .
so , you can put them out in the spring too ,
but once they ca n't stand the hot weather .
do they survive longer if you plant in the winter time them ?
they will make through the summer sun it ?
they wo n't make through the summer , because it got too hot , it
but they make it through probably winter and spring .
've got some of those too ,
i cause
that 's good .
it is ?
went out and sometimes
the fire than it is to rent to stress
have when
what the hell , and we figured ,
we did it when we were kids
and we loved it .
of course , we did n't really rough it that much .
he is a couple years older than me
and he went off to college
camp and we would out at the lake during the summer
floated it out on grapevine lake
and it was fantastic .
get up in the morning
for
and then we would go to work and come back to the house boat at night
four hours of
and it was great .
do you 've electricity out there
you 've got a phone obviously .
actually as a matter of fact , they just three years ago ran the phone
we did n't have a phone .
they did n't have phone lines .
just you could n't get phones .
the on the electric string
of the mail route the
so guess .
is in construction
our truck and was back .
everything we have was in boxes
my wife and said that we 're moving .
and where
out to the trailer and she said .
said , and oh
and said
but it 's not bad .
it 's not horrible ,
so we would go up .
kind of up
.
a little bit in the world
she take her motor home .
but she has a lot of fun .
she goes to shows dog .
she show dogs
a dog into a motel
ten dogs into a motel
so , she take the motor home .
with her all the dogs and .
if he would buy a her motor home .
he did so .
that will be pretty .
is going to need a vacation
that 's pretty really out there .
a lot of nice places
have lately you painted something ?
have
that room
have and then since then
another bedroom
one too did
the brown one
painted the outside of my house , and one bathroom
you get around the edge
that is hard .
how do you get the edge though ?
how do you get the edge ?
the straight edge ?
you 've just to be real careful .
.
even though still you make mistakes and that mostly do it .
the outside of your house
is going to do it actually this spring
houses six
as far as the materials
nice .
out of six houses
is going to change it to something ,
maybe so and it will stand out a little .
that will be nice .
did you painting ,
tone two or
are
did you
white .
have a problem , but
ca n't get
ca n't the chimney and
just not willing
, a friend of mine who live in your neighborhood out
was out there last week
except the chimney
we did too .
we did it in the fall
and it 's just too high .
it 's really scary ,
other than doing our own work .
and lots of it
hired so this man to come in and do it
what do you called those things ?
you talking about
that 's it .
and he did it that way
a hundred dollars up
if he fell , and he was dead
and he knew that .
was so that
plus , he cleaned up my mess .
think that 's what we might have to do with this chimney ,
it was n't too bad .
how much it did cost for for the outside the painting you ?
it is a story one ,
but we did two heavy coats over it .
then someone to do it but that way .
painted in his house out there
anyway they and charged only when him for one of painting gallon
and he told her
so she had to start all over again
so that were really worth it .
it was worth two hundred dollars of free stuff over .
really in that way .
but
we going to do another bathroom
probably will do it , just in a roller
never
known
are
your favorite team
baseball ?
do n't follow that closely
you do
paying the highest
.
think this is absolutely ridiculous and
is not real sure they should pay him
because he 's got one year more before he turns into a free agent .
that 's right .
who knows , and then
if he produce next year , they may have to end up paying him anyway ,
but if he does n't , then his market value will go down
and they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him the six million dollars a year this year .
that was a great deal for him .
is sure it was
it was a great deal for him
and , he signed on , just
so he 's real happy there .
the pitched coach ?
was just looking at the news tonight ,
and they showed
his
and think that 's a great addition
he seemed to know what he was doing
n't really
, and are not going to stand up on my , soapbox and say that
think and you 're right , that they need some changes in pitching coach , maybe probably
?
that 's contrary to popular belief .
, known
known , so
known
i
they need have some young guys to can take
have mixed so many emotions about all this
the types like
we enjoyed them
where you gone there have
have been too over there
where have you been ?
see 's
how
have got relatives there
just it there and .
is that
in the mountains so
how
liked it really there , too , and
it 's so expensive over there .
, known
it is true .
that is the one thing .
it 's really .
love to go over there
now you can get some really good deals flying over , actually
you have to spend money once you are still there .
, known
you can stay with them , then
.
that helped a lot .
there is n't gone even
feeling like we have accomplished a little bit here .
have n't
'd love to go to the east coast , during the fall and
want to go there
, have seen
and it looks gorgeous .
a trip up the east coast
it was in the summer
and it 's really pretty .
it 's just gorgeous over there .
on the east coast anywhere
just you 'll have to plan a vacation some time and go over there .
so guess .
but there 's a lot here to see
or we 'd have to ask for the check always
so over there
and it is
you would go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week ?
usually a bunch of different places .
you want to see everything
as much as you can while there are you .
known
liked it
and it 's not a place for tourists ,
to having tourists there
liked it , but
liked it
the people there very friendly just
what type of work ?
was working with an organization that do bible translation
find out
is that
enjoyed it
my cousin while came
how
of doing too that
that 's great .
so .
there are so
it sounds like we 've been to some of the same places .
it does .
you did hear our topic ?
to discussing homes
homes
you settled in a place
are settled in a place
about how
we were here for a few years ,
we came back just this summer
you familiar with that
it 's a nice area .
it is .
right now we 're in a temporary place
they enjoyed the school
so we 're kind of trying to stay here
are
the problem we got is that we 've got five children
four or five bedroom house
on the market and all that kind of thing
so we look at the paper ,
are
you , or settled
we 're
, is probably older than you
can board up their rooms
that empty nest syndrome to set is going in , i guess .
everyone but .
seem like a nice place to go
we 've got five
the oldest and 's ninth grade
's second grade and
think they are going to be forever with us and
do n't know if that 's true ,
we 're not anywhere near looking to cut down in size .
i
you need minimum very four and probably five .
in fact , six would be real good .
can share a bedroom
is it tough to find a five and six bedroom house
known
you 're in the dollar homes hundred thousand three or
and that 's an awful lot .
it is ,
actually , if we 'll be doing all right .
think the thing is out there , but
it 's just a matter of finding the right place ,
of matter ,
will lot of people in your situation
for me at my office from the high school
and there were seven kids in her family .
and they did this and that ,
seemed , but they always
once , it will be just fine ,
until then , a stressful little just looking all the time , and that sort of thing , but it 's
known
and there 's nothing harder than that .
my wife chore that
her narrow it down to three or four
look a lot more than
maybe that 's the case .
she 's got more opinions , at least
constraints that things more more
.
what kind of business
the goods business
is a manufacturer 's rep
fourteen different hunting
with
we just moved down to be down here on staff and
as far as housing prices
find they are higher here
to come down here and then we thought things , would be lower
and they are not .
spent four years as a university professor
spent three years ,
in public schools and elementary school
really do you ?
that 's great .
did
, did
pretty young for a university professor sound
was pretty young
have never
view of and how you can explain it
familiar with
initially to integrate the public schools
and what it involves is basically
become the teacher and
used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so
the combination of technology and techniques like that together with marketplace
think there 's a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster
too many states
about the cost and ineffectiveness that results
the pace of learning and .
are those kinds of things will eventually solve the problem and
do n't know
an enormous prices for
what year saying
totally
you must see kids with real significant problems in some cases .
it , deteriorated a lot is .
are they pretty happy with it ,
was the way that the schools was going , a lot of people
maybe it was
had a lot of schools but
so , you saw a fair number of troubled kids .
you said how for the kids than they were thirty years ago .
they were considering providing hot breakfast for the kids
as well
we have both credit cards
they be a part of life
how do you use them ?
do use them
more than others
my balances fairly reasonable
pay them off any month if
occasionally but they can
and they can build up all .
think they are handy
do n't carry a lot of cash with me
writing when checks
you do use credit cards ?
a
go into debt on them
grandmother
my mother learned from that so
me be very , very careful with them
just basically so
use a credit rating so that
just have been married seven months ,
but he has the same habit
of the major ones a
that 's good .
but always so that we do n't pay any charge service .
is that
of debt
of what we are spending
the interest rates are in credit cards
them keep building
is that
them get out of hand
it is
sometimes who
and so a bill will come in
and did n't know it was going to be high that
so far , but we have been able to pay off every time it
that 's good .
right now is kind of looking for a visa that have a lower interest rate
it seems that some of them have gotten higher
and did n't write down at the time it
who was my visa
so want to find something that have a lower rate
you ever used
have n't
is not even sure what is their interest rate since
find many places to do n't take
and there 's no annual fee , that 's good service .
also back at you cash and then .
dollars back two or something
probably if use you but you get more back .
back for using your credit card
.
that 's it .
did n't know that
think the charge service is pretty too low and
's , but not sure
'll take so they now ,
but never did
can do with those two enough damage
it 's best
at all past few years
probably would n't be able to use them
have to admit that is one of my favorite places to shop
you do have anything else to say ?
not more about credit cards .
do n't
it was good talking .
luck .
have a good evening .
too
are concerned that it 's probably apt that 's because we just got your call at this time
be upon a third felony conviction
, too
summary mandatory execution , on the steps , that day
think person is beyond rehabilitation
and he should be taken out .
almost all people
they just got too old .
have the trouble with the way
, on a little bit more fair manner
very often said
believe it to be a very true axiom , and
so would be white , rich and black and innocent than guilty rather
they will kill you .
if it is hundred two hours of community service and .
you do n't hear too much of those cases .
we are the majority ,
whatever the hell we want to do
that 's right .
and you are the minority
and you 're
the on the wall there 's handwriting , is n't it ?
it is sure .
but that is another issue altogether .
think that 's ten years on death row cruel and unusual punishment
our judicial system as it is right now
it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution is
was
and once they found guilty you judge said he is guilty ,
kill him .
there were some people who have a problem with that .
and he 'll say guy did not me it .
lie for him
people
it 's a strange thing ,
they but
that guy at
they convicted him .
he was too far away when it happened .
they were n't dope dealers ,
of security sense a very high
these were really responsible people and .
and they convicted because says somebody this guy , he looks like the right guy .
to me the
big lips , flat nose
that was him .
you did this morning watch the bulls ?
you know ,
watched a little bit of the game bulls
and had to leave
the bulls was ahead when
who won the game ?
they won by two points .
is that right ?
they were behind as they headed into each quarter
and then they come back in the second half
and think they looked like they were closing it out at
the bulls and .
now the best
, as a matter of fact
they looked real good
,
they are balancing their attack
, known
saw the second half of the game last night
and they were impressive .
they look good .
that was a good move for the warriors for him to trade .
good move
really work well out
the warriors 've got a team ,
what they can do and .
they 're ahead ,
and do n't know ,
do n't know , in
with any of the other teams
they have a hard time
this whole year been disastrous just for them
how many losses in
it 's unbelievable .
not a whole lot
them to be pretty loyal with the local teams
it is true ,
is n't really ,
it is ?
so it 's not something you 'd drive ,
and they 've got a great club .
they 've done a good job .
of course , certainly drafting a franchise like him
that makes always a big difference .
think that 's the way it now works in basketball
think one player , do n't really made
but really do it .
you get somebody like
and you can see the decline in that team .
it 's not once he left the same team .
there is not that they used to rely on him for the leadership there .
think you 're right
those things do make and
do n't know who would meet them in the west
watched only a few minutes of it
and were n't paying attention
, and so do n't know
is that
work in a hospital .
have taken care of a few aids patients and
right now is what they are spending adequate when they asked
do n't
or think they would by now have already
so do n't know if really spending a lot more money would make right now
think they 're doing research as much as they can do possibly
and about what you ?
is not too aware of how much they 're right now spending
is not either
is not aware of how much definitely
kept up with
is not sure ,
to go ahead .
always more about the disease rather than the research
you know
and that sort of thing .
'd just have to say if we were talking about the money
can see that research
.
think so
think so .
it is becoming a major problem .
that 's true .
safe sex and feeling is not the answer .
it is , in certain cases abstinence
it is definitely not .
that 's true ,
that 's true .
is about to get a divorce ,
is not all ready
's yourself single again but
what 's going to happen and .
you you 're going do n't
sex with
but it 's something you got to think .
a single person ,
and it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry .
for a lot of people it had thought .
.
drug addicts
and do n't know ,
do n't think that 's a bad idea
it sort of does n't address the problem of drug addiction
just sort of it
, but do n't know
, can not be ,
, so do n't know
, do n't know
what do you think about that ?
that 's a hard issue .
it 's really .
it 's really .
it 's really .
they gave us a hard topic .
the drug problem
that 's true .
that 's true .
the two problems , drug addiction and aids aids would have to come first as far as something do about it
so do n't know
if there are so many things in the world
see which is worse .
do n't know
into how much money they are spending
have no idea
our money and tax know .
have but never really
have no idea
either have n't
and different voices saying we 're not spending enough
and , mostly that is
, so do n't know
it sounds like big money to me
but it probably take a lot .
think it 's
think it 's
seems to take it
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think that it would .
had any fear working in the hospital with that ,
is that
, under some of those conditions
but do n't fear it at all
the operating room a lot
there or free a crime ?
do n't think there 's any longer any such thing , as a free zone crime
are afraid that you 're right
and they caught one of the men in the hedging
the one other and then was on the roof in the back .
by your house ?
on my house .
so is very much aware of crime in the cities and the concern about it
be a frightening way to spend an evening
it was .
knew and so
through the house into the garage walked
there was no one there ,
wanted to be sure , but
.
that is too bad .
and now you can tell , for sure the change .
that could n't be too far from you , neither .
west of me
living over near white lake rock .
never thought ,
apparently they but .
do n't know how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody
does n't seem possible
, it is n't it
of the consequences at the time a
and go away
a tremendous part in
think that may be an excuse for people , too
, it is n't it
was doing
that kind
just like the old alcohol idea
where do you work ?
think
is a pretty rough area there
it 's a pretty rough area .
we is over .
the people and .
the kids and
that is definitely big time .
big time , there
is
it is surely .
be careful
that is the worst in the whole area neighborhood .
it is sometimes
you , probably up on
the roles but that women .
enter the work force since when they started two world war is more
bet .
think that 's very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women and
bet .
is a traveling salesperson
most of my life
in the last half of dozen i years
sell
and even in our industry was really and as far as
even in the last five or six years and we
as far as how they 're doing things and it 's a credit to them
while leaving in the care of their husbands their children
bet .
one of the girls
she says , and my children have two parents .
why .
bet .
sort of
so think that 's a change
, people having that kind of attitude that 's going to take the father in
think it 's the old age thing ,
and they are carrying the same job responsibility
that 's a very true statement and
and it should n't be that way .
also change in
i hope so ,
it 's been changing ,
it 's been evolving ,
but there is still an inequality in the work forces or jobs .
say he 's a man ,
he needs that salary .
.
think a good for that argument is in the area of politics , also
congressman make a woman
so certainly all the way .
for me the most significant thing changed , again , as
and going
to having two now parents
that 's a good statement .
think it will be
another thing i read the other day , too , is the car designers starting to design with women in mind cars
the men are looking in the engine
can her makeup off the upholstery and come .
bet .
good
there and if they 're out buying that many cars , then there is that many out that
right now is
and my wife 's always worked .
she is a schoolteacher ,
she started working
she was selling real estate at the time
hers for three or four months and was the only income we have
she did certainly her part in
and she still work
all .
bet .
be off today
i work
enjoying it
what kind of work do you do ?
is a nurse
?
to say in
, do n't know
's kind of out of things
the old cigarette ads about you come a long way
you come a long way baby
baby ,
you think about this when
and it 's really true .
women came a long way
in child care right now
two old daughter year in child care
real good child care at a pretty reasonable prices
how about you ,
you do have any children ?
our first
and he turned just three months .
so , we 're just starting into hunting for child care .
right now , .
are
where
you going to put your son in child care in a year or two
probably
now he is going to have to be days a week more in child care .
four to eight hours a day in
is right now
hired , just as a matter of fact a girl to watch him
get out of class at certain time
and my wife already is supposed to be on her way to her class .
happens where we ca n't be home , one of us once a day
, is a good experience
a lot of things about to think
written on the topic
any other important decision
and that is more important than anything else .
a fancier facility to
she goes to a home .
from china early in their lives
they 've got three daughters .
and they are both there
and they have a kid -lrb- comes in and helped them in the afternoon .
and enjoy going to see ,
so it 's a good experience .
that makes a big difference .
think it 's very good for the child if it 's good
and , and that 's
in a year
we but
and we were able to choose just in the marketplace .
there 's a lot of child care available ,
but there invariably is waiting lists .
they are
off just campus child care
but they have a pretty good size waiting list .
it 's a hard real thing to do , even in for people , university communities
and there are quite a waiting list to get into that .
so it is an important , decision ,
this is really
it 's best ,
the best way
my own interest in human development leads to believe that 's a good sign and private enterprise is the way to go , and it will lead me
entrepreneurial commercial ventures
primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life .
it is
the human operating system ,
credit cards
'll what tell you ,
say a whole lot about credit cards
is that right ?
some other people have done that
got because of credit cards in some financial problems
of all of them
have
we have some friends that did exactly the same thing .
just they and except for one they kept for emergencies up
and they are still paying away to get out of debt .
known
but
did
i sort
of them quite a
continually use ,
that in the bank to pay for
them and off pay totally always every month .
is that right ?
that 's a good policy .
just for me a
, do n't have to get cash out of the bank
and do n't have to be writing checks
sometimes i wish
do n't have the control
i wish
but n't
just do n't want to get into that situation again ,
it is easy ,
, just a little signature
what .
that 's it .
who gas to get some gas
'll and
of a bill the
did get , that costs so much
.
some inherent limits there
, are not going to run up you
that 's true ,
the thing that helps me most are doing that really not so much discipline , probably
sort of
are n't it ,
that 's unbelievable .
let this
how old ,
me
it is coming .
about the interest rates on
it 's unbelievable .
pay them interest
and she did n't really have the money ,
but she could pay off it ,
it on credit cards
but she is paying it ,
and wo n't do it just
give it to them
need borrow that kind of money
bet and then .
for credit cards with rates much less
income .
there , too , there is
if you 've got a pretty good credit rating you can call wherever you got your card from and tell them , either drop or drop my annual fees
or just 'll go to somewhere else
and they are more than willing to do that , if you 've got a pretty good history with them .
had about nine or ten years for
he wrote a book on it
of his cards
can get this card from this banking at this rate
it does not for me to do that make sense
'll go ahead and send your card back you just and if you wo n't drop my rates
'll go somewhere else and get it and
the big thing is for me the annual fee
and just refuse
wo n't get any card now ,
've got a good rating
and are not going to pay an annual fee
this is an unusual topic .
what do you think about it ?
it took eight times to find
should say
he reminded me , and then
just so they and
just a small , type dinner thing and then at a parking or something to have .
how do they come ?
we have gone and sometimes
his dad 's family and are all around the area
they have everybody and each time .
that make sense .
nobody is out of a lot of trouble more than once .
and that person can call beforehand and just make sure everyone knows , too .
they just sort of and then do little a program or something like so that
that is interesting .
you sound like you have a lot of experience with this , then
is that
to either have or
and we 're all there
a , orange county area
mostly not than an hour away
.
of the family my mother 's
years ago there were
they have a reunion since then
and all that
have gone to last summer ever
in from out of town
and they have some activity ,
and all of that stuff
about various parts of the family tree
a lot of that sort of thing and
one that we 'd have you could do that once since it was the first .
next time we have one , we 'll have to think of something creative to do more .
everyone is very just interested and inevitably
and they 've always two or three new ones to add to the list ,
someone is been born
someone or passed away
something like that or
or little
not very much compared to my mother-in-law
not a passion
we will do more of it
about some of the relatives
a lot of
they 're really kind of fascinating .
was my grandmother
virtually no background on
is sure she is dead , now because my grandmother died about twenty years ago
.
is probably
just moved away and then maybe they
do n't know
how you doing ?
.
let
can run and shut my radio off ?
you calling from
are
not all good stuff .
in any of that
is not
you do work ?
is going to school right now
?
my husband 's
i working for myself
do miss a lot of benefits from working
the steady paychecks come
is selling out in now to go to school full time
the freedom of having that
is that right ?
wanted to or not
but the benefits was n't there .
i own part of a company roofing
do you ?
unfortunately and we were part of a bigger company
and we have all the benefits there
, and do miss that
with my family have
because his medical through his company , my husband , gets
we have , but
is the only one who are being insured and
someone over there that have children four
is that right ?
the and way medical expenses
'll what tell you ,
that the single most benefit
looked into picking up just some medical insurance just for my family ,
and it 's unbelievable
it is out of sight .
it is out of sight .
even at a rate group .
it 's unbelievable
the amount that you have to pay for kids and
want and if
it goes up .
the bonuses and stuff
is sure it will be quite a few people and
it 's going to hurt the city ,
used to work at a bank ,
pay that whole time
they come in there ,
is making a week a hundred dollars sitting there and
is that right ?
done this , in a way to themselves , because of the unions
the union ,
just the other day .
is that right ?
an additional six months through the worker 's stuff plus they 've probably through the company
it 's happening because it 's going to hurt ,
but do n't
if , we 'd get more check one
and that would be it .
the ones it 's going to hurt actually be around in that area really the businesses
that already is hurting .
the ones that
they voted them in
a no prescription on the medical , all these things
the prices of
in unions
but they went too far .
'll tell you ,
had my fill of unions
and got
stayed for we and there ,
and they have a way of dragging you back home .
water
and .
a lot
about how you ?
, but do n't know
somehow do n't have the time anymore
down and the next thing
those take a lot of time .
pretty fast , because we just got our baby last year ,
and just do n't have the patience just to do something
this is your first baby ?
that 's the only thing ,
did a quilt , and
see 's
have done a quilt for our baby
have done a quilt for our bed , and
embroidery the pattern
or how did you make a quilt ?
our baby 's quilt , it was like the design ,
around the design in the quilt just went
it or anything like that
you did
it was small enough that you just could hold it ?
you familiar with that
was always
have one of them
have n't done tons of them
used to do more before we got our baby , but
and they 'll wear them .
to talk then once they will no longer wear them .
i paint around it and then
do that make sense to you ?
think it 's very clever
was they and
they were , and
truly out fell , but when or most of it off
bought some just glue cloth
is so familiar with that ,
someone told me they have done it both ways ,
your favorite shows
you did see the other night it ?
that was pretty good .
that one was .
and everything
northern exposure and home improvement
have n't seen either of those
you have never seen northern exposure ?
it is a great show .
but always , it 's on so late here .
we like , too .
have you seen the movie ?
barely , just got interested in it , just in the last year or so
and they 're out already six with number by now ,
any of the movies , yet ,
you have n't seen any of them .
they are good ,
they are real good .
they are getting rid of the old cast for the movies , though .
you watching
the new ones ?
of the older ones quite a
have n't seen that much really the new generation
better , are there one you prefer
the older one or the newer one ?
they are a lot different .
like the older ones because at that time
the newer ones
of them both but .
, too , .
he hate almost the new ones .
or something and the other one is n't a soap opera
but , .
not really .
it is not really like a soap opera ,
but that 's true ,
more about the characters and stuff
but that 's
's see
he is getting onto them
the same ones over and over , though like that one where he goes to college ,
there are or on a series .
there is one on ,
this last time it was about this movie director ,
saw one that
you did see that ?
do n't know if that 's the movie of the week or what ,
but it seems like there is only about four or five different ones ,
and then they keep showing over and over them .
have n't seen before it
he was a movie director ,
on the set or something
that was pretty good though .
it was .
but
do n't think so
is never home , but
and ca n't remember what it 's
used to watch twin peaks
you never saw that ?
of it a lot
a lot of
they 'll say so and from twin peaks or something so .
that was a different soap opera .
but , it was a different type of show .
did n't like the way it ended , though
they did end the whole series ?
they did it only for two years .
but it 's all over now .
also do you ?
you ready to begin ?
we might as well .
care of
you do
do n't think of my relatives any would like to go there really
will be able to bring also her into my home and my father or have someone go into their home and after them look just
it is
like somebody had thrown away them
but attitude of staff make such a tremendous difference .
and has no family that could care for her
the offices in
a lot of the things that they did
and they have a lot of games
all sorts of things
and very
it 's just a job
they have to do and get out go home
of the staff as you said the attitude is really very very important .
some who have any real grasp on any longer reality
may and
like small children
that were n't on a daily basis in that situation to have to deal with
they would just roll around all over the place themselves
and they would
would and then you see
they did n't participate because they had some , slight mental disabilities and things like that , together with the others and just
they were n't really together with the rest of them , and when they got together for such activities .
your opinions on recycling
think we need start recycling definitely
we waiting what 's happening until somebody say we have to do it
heard around here that the landfills will be full by the year thousand two
that too
that 's not too far away , and
but do n't know how it is there
is much to do it
i take , my paper
plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store
can take to
have enough of them to make
started saving newspapers
a ton of them
ca n't
but they would n't take them .
is it real hard to find a spot
then do n't know
bottles
known
glass
it could be recycled ,
there is no really recycling facilities .
think that 's a good idea
besides a law
think so
they have to ,
you do n't do it right
trouble for me
is willing to do it
a place to store of it all
living in an apartment and .
it 's very difficult .
our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers
and so do n't know
need to be more places
and also have a strong real opinion
no matter what it 's
and then you take it back to the store
and you get back .
you forced to
and you do n't see the litter there also .
that 's true .
take it back
do n't
have seen them
that take them back .
some of them
ten cents
is looking at it right now
to take no place
do n't think there is enough being done
we have a recycling program is company wide paper and
for that the recycling and .
they do at the office
because there 's a lot of waste there is n't there .
there 's a lot of paper computer that you ca n't use
from the recycling program
charities to
a substantial amount of money from it
i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later ,
them have my business
could be done much better
there is
, known
some of the stuff
why did you think of that before n't
and think
people just do n't care
and they do n't want to think .
that 's true .
do n't want my grandchildren looking at me
at least tried
and do n't know
we run out of places to put it
then we will be forced to .
it may be too late .
very little
then , that is pollution .
do n't have any place to burn it
known
into the pollution factor
can take glass and
a lot of glass
it 's really sad .
you buy some
it depends upon our weather here ,
today was a beautiful day
it was like summer days .
so in a light skirt weight
had some appointments at the office today
had anyway dress up and
wore heels and then
how do you dress ?
is going to talk
and wore heels anyway
have been a teacher
so has my daughter
, known
it walk up to the door
that 's right .
but you 're going to look nice for the kids .
that 's right
and it makes you always feel like you are a bigger than the kids person ?
can get
, too , .
than some of the boys in the older grades
would then wear boots if it looked really dangerous
change , into heels , as soon as
it has a heel on it .
the kind of
we wear them , and
that a boot leather
and said they have a regular heel on them , high heel
we wear and a lot with shirts and things .
they are not a cowboy boot ,
but they are just a real pretty boot ,
of course , you probably wear a lot coats .
was in a room where they did n't heat it
, so did
then you have to so .
then the third year
so it was nice .
things , then improved
but of course , we here wear a light weight jacket a lot
that 's nice .
and that 's
it depends upon our winter .
a winter coat
most of the time you can wear a sweater but
we just do n't wear much coats and .
we often laugh about even when .
to running around like that
it 's really different .
let it that way
are
and are working at a day care right now
.
are working in the room with kids from six months to twenty months nursery
you do so
more practical
a hundred times it or something
but never wore jeans
it 's all right for the students ,
but did n't think teachers should
is that
there are some good things about it
but have seen
where you did live before ?
do a lot about air pollution
they asked me to ask you were where you thought ?
cars and factories
that 's what
but do n't know for sure
over the border from us come .
think the automobile is definitely an area and any industry that burns ,
and then do n't know about chemical pollution
is not real into that as far as how it affect the air
we have a lot of the type indoor pollution
insulated too well
people getting sick
but do n't
about me that 's what they were outside
would be cars and factories and
in these spray bottles which is
is destroying the ozone
again that is
and there 's big this debate apparently about whether there is a hole in the ozone or not
but it was discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought , initially at .
it is kind of scary .
it 's scary
clean literally and our act , up
the environment
, is where people will use their fireplaces
where you ca n't
think it will
and , it 's
people in this country really wed to their cars
this is one of the big problems , and
we have to drive so far ,
but we 're getting it even here .
and you can tell it in the too mornings .
and there 's just a brown fog here
and we do n't even have .
the population and the more we
that makes a lot of sense .
about it that way
you do n't have to have
so
we can comment
and we did n't see this a few years ago .
it was pretty clear here .
and we 're going to feel it ,
to be a big structural change in the economy , in this country
this country and in politically unacceptable
how much fun it 's drive
but think we 're going to have to make
many cars , houses , we sell .
you do see somebody driving a big car , just one person in that
it 's a lot of waste
any elderly relatives currently in
.
do you ?
have a grandmother
she is a hundred and two .
three in
put her not
also live here in town
and then take care of her
she still have
she take care of her own business .
have seen my family age
she 's been ten years now there .
, and have seen in the time , and with the expense and everything them age twenty
worth if it
and they needed some quality care ,
someone in
they have to make a decision family .
there are seven children in my husband 's family
but they were very fortunate .
it is a small town
and she happens to room with one of the doctor 's mothers
and then she is
that 's good .
nobody thought she would adjust ,
that 's great .
is facing also my father that is very sick , but then
she 's been taking care of him .
do n't know how much longer can this last
he ca n't do anything without her .
he does n't
and it 's really sad
my brothers not interested in helping me
would have to move him here down so
put into one him
can go see
they have styles apartment ,
but that would n't work for him .
think he is beyond that
if you need help you can get it ,
but people kind of have a small apartment basically
doctors available if they need them
only the problem with these
and the bad thing about it , before you can get any kind of government help you have to be a pauper .
it takes every pence .
and that 's the sad part about it .
talked to my mother
my mother and could make on that it .
would then send it back to her and
so that 's what would happen .
is that
you just have to give away everything .
it 's unfortunate .
i working at
it 's frightening .
and do n't
we are the generation moving
care of us and .
ca n't imagine
we do n't have any children .
, had them later in life that everybody
my mother and my father
they are not so that far away .
a squeeze my generation between
he 's still living at home and
and do n't
known
of having both generations
but something will have to change as of us more and more got older .
but .
most people
most
that 's the problem .
and that 's the bad thing .
so long
she lived by herself .
away my grandfather passed before
that is incredible .
do you want to go ahead
they really big on women 's rights
a lot of rallies and things like that and so have seen .
's , but not
is my mom
some traits from her stuff and
think it is interesting and better for women to see that there are more of them doing men 's fields , but
like to see that
do n't like to see women waiting on hand and foot men and
things for
, too , .
the idea
have five children
and they are
seeing the men and so much .
think it 's great
me too
i hope that happens to me
do n't mind doing stuff
got to make him dinner and stuff and
but he 'll help me do the dishes .
do n't want to expect to help clean up then after
that 's right .
that 's right .
my that men
to clean up with their women
and they are good about it .
see all work together
or go back to work
and they are
is they
think we 'll see we and then now ?
think
working at a high school .
is a black woman
and she is very sharp .
and the ethnic thing is now a good thing .
me too
they are moving up them
and they 're sharp
so believe you 're going to see a lot
like to see that
and see that all educated minority person who really knows what they are talking about
still some people look
that 's a shame .
especially black women
but they would n't know what they 're doing .
but never have gone far along with that even back
my mother was years ago that way .
the
some people say the boys should n't have to do those jobs .
they have to do as much as we did .
that was so good .
same here
keep , not necessarily as far as by sex thing type
same here
you should be able to accomplish as much .
think the attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now and
to the young girls you can do it all
if he can do it , you can do it thing type .
men more participating in the family things with children
what about politics on it ?
that on politics
is not
because 's kind of this disgusted year
and even for president and vice president this year
with that
there are nobody again .
now her name
do n't know
who
what you 're about
she took such a rough go of it .
their tax deal and
that is so good .
they would get some more on that
did n't see any of the women in there
and do n't think we have too many right now
woman congress
have written this down
do you think it 's possible to have ?
you 're asking my opinion , what about whether it 's possible to have .
suspect that it is possible
think it is more likely if you have a small unit where everybody know everybody government probably
is that
depends maybe just
that is interesting .
read something one time
was it and
it was written many years ago .
have a completely honest system of government
thought that was interesting and
it was n't just talking .
just government in
so they are saying government officials would tend to be seekers power .
that would be a question next to ask and .
they be a service to us
in there for their own gains they
there 's probably some of each
can steal while in an office but how many friends
how good a name and can
it would be like anything else
's see
but , there 's a lot in business .
a little more honesty in the campaigns would
we put on politicians
we expect them to be there to serve us only .
if you knew what you were getting when you , voted
, that is n't it
it is interesting
is it so easy to blame them to
think it is our own fault
we do n't want to hear the truth
, they get
if the truth , we do n't elect especially with all this stuff coming them ,
and do n't know why would anybody want to get under that scrutiny anymore
it 's hard to imagine .
because it 's got
not we 're talking
we 're talking about somebody 's personal life
and we 're getting away from what we ought to be looking at .
also think that it would be funny if we could know everything about the people who was in there , and throw them out
do n't
you 're taking a government course ?
at
the university ?
and it 's really enjoyable .
like
they also do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption , and then ask
you can make laws against corruption .
does n't eliminate it
do n't think making laws will stop it
do n't know how many laws you would have to have
i
sure did n't , did it ?
so
think you can legislate
by legislating it all
just think that 's human nature that you 're going to have
think actually other countries , may have it worse
the prime minister or people
sometimes get up
still but this is the best when
have been around to a few other countries
would rather live in
think we 've got the best at its worst
what 's your favorite kind of music ?
have to say my favorite classical music type of music probably would be
same here
what type of music
what era or like the most ?
through at least some modern music from
and especially these days .
we 've been sort of fans opera for a few years now .
the places we have gone they
we have quite a collection of those , and so
you at home and
so you figure out
and then you can enjoy it in the theater .
what is that ?
did n't know that
that can help people like me .
can understand that
of that era the
, like
i course , like
have and two in my house string
instruments string
go to four or five concerts a year
old how
so they 're doing in school or what this ?
you 've got a half string quartet there .
we 're on our way .
try to enjoy of it all
a little bit ,
, but do n't know about as far as the titles
are listening
do belong to a musical heritage society
you do belong to that ?
n't
what it 's but .
ca n't something recordings
you can get recordings .
a lot of original recordings themselves and .
thought .
they 've actually them , and
they record and it
so , they 're actually
a lot of them
or they will find out when they are performing ,
and they will record the music at that time .
and so it 's high quality music grade ,
also now , and they have , of course
good things about the music heritage society
up spending my money on music all but if
you can control it .
my roommate signed me up .
he got
got a lot of bills and
.
so we have to watch that .
that 's good .
you do
what type of magazines do you 've ?
we take at home
ski magazine
d and stereo review and national geographic and boys life
.
that 's a good one
take it that you like to ski
do a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine ?
do get things from ski associations and things during the year
discounts and things like that
not that so
see those at a ski show or something
and just but
in there , too , always .
receive information
probably .
, wanted to take we
and we started just looking around .
of them a
we have n't been there before .
that sounds nice .
lift low lines
but to
you need come out .
deer valley is nice , too
valley
,
it is wonderful snow .
how about you ,
at home who magazines do you have
we do and
we have some magazines church , and then
it does have articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth ?
the ads on the equipment , mostly they have ,
with pictures and projects that you can make ,
so , and it is really a fun one .
like
that 's good .
it is to get use out of one good .
,
for a long period of time
have
have , but
every once they come in .
magazine
found , but not myself ever getting around to reading it just
so many coming in
come in and by the time
that .
i
that 's my mostly 's son , and
do read too , but
he , like to try that
does get , though , to be a lot of paper ,
they can do that .
they 've been for my little girls fun ,
they are five and four years old ,
just kind of
find good for those use
mine , is a senior high school in
of that trail the
you 're just sort of beginning to think .
it is fun .
a boy in
so we 're kind of running the gamut .
really do n't have a favorite type
a lot of different types of music
do you ?
have to cassette tapes
but it 's
about how you ?
as very well
ever for maybe heavy metal and that meet
that is exactly me .
the rock acid or the heavy metal
, but not , mostly as a general rule
do n't care for that at all
too much , either rap
that does n't appeal to my ears .
think as far as the rap goes
some of their songs and .
,
with the general rule would n't either choose rap
like to listen to what you might call
varied pretty music , said
listen to her
and they are
really .
so , they are
you might try that .
about how you ?
would listen to jazz or classical music
get on my nerves after
you ca n't just listen to it especially a lot of the deeper stuff ,
you ca n't just listen to it for enjoyment unless you 're playing it ,
it 's too ,
, it seems
it just do n't do anything .
what about the blues or something like that ?
blues okay
tell ,
grew up on blue grass music
my dad , is a big blue grass fan
was in high school
but really , a lot like it .
some of it
does n't sound like the old music country at all
it does n't ,
it does n't .
some of it sounds more like pop music .
do n't care for that
grew up on him
that type of
sons of the pioneers
tracks a lot
do you ?
a lot of original music that way
sure .
think about the twin peaks and stuff like that recent that is just real
like things like to listen to .
instrumental things
great to is n't
they are
.
is that
it is sure ,
still kind of
he has a nice smooth voice .
and he looks like he is having fun
some people
like it hurts them or something
a good time but .
all he wants to do is
and he 's real fun to listen to .
think it was five of them or something
, was it five
something like ,
it was last year was n't it .
or the year before last year ,
ca n't remember ,
was listening to a particular radio station , but
you do
?
have n't done any of the oil or watercolor
would like to learn that someday ,
do you do a lot of it ?
took one class about three or four years
have done a little , and
but it takes a lot of time .
it does ,
it 's real consuming time
you do sell your projects ?
have given them away just as gifts
but would like to make enough to sell and quit my job eventually
where do you work at ?
do you send any of your stuff to the boutique ever ?
just have n't enough to do that
five children of
that keeps you busy .
me busy
you do cut out your own projects ?
really that and so enjoy doing
do you ever a
on or do you ?
i brush
just bought a spray gun , one of those high volume , low spray guns pressure
and that 's
do you ?
have n't but
fine furniture .
do you ?
but it 's hard to finish it .
put on a nicer finish
that is interesting .
what kind of equipment do you 've ?
see me
it sounds like you 're really into it .
that 's nice .
it is .
the saw band is really nice .
do n't
have the right equipment
, that does n't it
of any or just
like
give it away as gifts
but , making my own furniture .
that is interesting .
you did take classes to learn how to do that ?
just in
and then up with that just
that is interesting .
necessarily want to do furniture ,
but just
so , it is fun .
now you go
they come on ,
and tell us
?
this is so my first one .
you 're probably
it really been fun
enjoyed this
so think you 'll enjoy doing it
it is fun .
fun sound .
it is by the , restaurant copper mill , and there
see 's
think of the name
n't right off
it 's pretty deep feelings ,
saw that well .
the guy 's eyes your gouging , out
going to do you
him finish me off for what
finally , drew a draft high number
and you ?
was too much young ,
draft age
think they were very happy
personally just went in limbo
were ready to go out of the country or join special forces ,
either one
did n't know just
so do you feel that it was worth what we did there over ?
just a
mark again was that
the in lives and money
with that
it had on our country
.
the say we should go into the grief that are there
always as a country that
so it 's pretty serious , really ,
lot of things that
that over the entire involvement
war to
that
is n't that something ?
have
we 'll see you .
our five minutes up according to me
to you they
was n't really keeping count
but i guess ,
and mostly
'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that
a lot of
is just starting to get into a little bit more now communications
you do n't have that way to make a hard copy .
you using windows
used to use an apple just two e , which looks pretty primitive , now , of course
, was an apple in my high school e two
in my business use it
what do you do ?
on a , other language
is working with exactly
better than the average person on that
worked for the school community ,
because it 's a lot harder on a computer
you do n't have hand gestures and things like that .
use for what a computer
the stuff that
analysis data on
just , item analysis , statistical analysis of the tests
and which ones are n't find out
try .
so it involves a lot of spreadsheet use .
would so imagine
what was you doing so when you were using an apple e two ?
was doing some of the same stuff , but doing it slowly and with smaller files
have now got megabytes five on this one
it 's amazing how the expectations in the user general community have grown just so much .
started playing with apples , and then
is that
quite far yet that
may have to do that and get another possibly hard disk
do n't know
they say , seven system use a lot of memory .
i
so you have eight children .
as a family to spend time together
cheap generally things
we know how that goes .
you do n't have lots of money for recreation with lots of kids .
that 's right .
that is fun .
so , let 's see
, we like to play a lot games ,
and you may think this is funny ,
that is so fun and .
a crack out of that
we do like to go to the park , too like your family .
a lot of
an occasional one or two days thing
where they do live ?
so that is a bit of a drive for you there .
so you like to go for the holidays there
we do n't very often go for holidays .
the ages of your kids
so you have
that 's right .
your children
starting at twelve ours
go down to four and then .
all of our kids together with the span age that we have ,
i bet ,
playing board games , and that kind of thing
the young kids do n't understand , but it
when we try to do that ,
, then if the older kids and then to get
and they want to do something else .
can relate to that
do you feel that the current trend in families are spending time together a positive one or a negative one ?
think it 's improving , actually
we have the other day an interesting experience .
we have pretty much
at home of
our next door neighbor , and was there
and so we can spend time with them .
that 's good .
those kinds of things happening
where the families were running all different direction just one
more people interested in spending time with their kids now
think so
it does begin with the families at home and
and so too , is a firm in that believer
a lot of people
that 's true .
hopefully and it 's going to spread .
very
very
like you 're in the minority
they look like we did n't have good sense when at us .
.
never been back , since then
but now , we have kids up there ,
so we get up occasionally .
do n't have any idea
have never
must be a little town
it out there is
they have a ranch that has five acres hundred ,
.
what kind and do you 've ?
in an apartment except for the cat living alone .
about how you ?
we have a cat ,
they are just aggressive by nature
so he is an indoor cat ,
he been aggressive , especially towards my little girl really for some reason
's been
you have him how long
we have him for about two years
two years
and he was so mean right after first we got him to her .
now he bites and her .
he ca n't
he bites her .
he does bite her enough to draw blood ?
of times a
he love my son ,
it is his cat ,
and he is
and he is so funny ,
he follows around just like just a dog my son .
let my son even
while he showers , and it is
is so he
i guess
as long as he does n't get too aggressive with the daughter he 's all right
you would n't want to carry or something off her him .
because we could n't have him being aggressive towards the girl so , just to take
but he seems
we do and keep our daughter away from him .
the cat would not be in this house .
is that
it is ,
we tried a dog about four years ago ,
it ended up being a huge , huge dog just that ate us out of house and home anyway .
we 're in a house ,
.
we could n't allow him to run free ,
just up all the time
and it was unfortunate .
have you tried other any pets ?
living alone in an apartment
they are
and do they just training paper it or something ?
i guess
i guess ,
they do n't have many more than one to start with , either
be fun if
they are pretty smelly otherwise .
that 's right .
the dog show
we do n't have cable .
.
and that they have on last week ,
that 's really kind of something to watch , and
it is on for maybe an hour or two two or three nights
is that right ?
some of them beautiful really
be
live here out
really it and out here .
it is kind of country .
kind of , but not too
do you ?
the first one very
have been doing it for about two weeks
do n't know
think the budget is really out of hand right now ,
in this election year and especially think
offering little their tax cut token program when it 's just such a bad time for it
token cuts and as you said .
that 's not really going to do a lot of good to your income middle average person .
you can buy a coke or something for that .
mostly it 's not a cut , actually
it 's just a cut in the amount .
a lot of sense to me
much that sparks really far my interest that maybe
have a lot of respect for him
will not
my read
ca n't and then follow through on this
but it seems to me that the budget is so out of hand ,
the cold war , they say
number of billion , trillion dollars a year
know where that money actually is going to go ,
is going to see any of this so-called peace dividend ever
either in favor of social large government programs because
with this peace dividend , but it seems like you could set up some kind of public works projects like they have in the thirties
think that would be a great idea
it would greatly help unemployment .
surely and do n't
totally
just it seems
right now is in college ,
is so
where do you go ?
the political science required class ago
one of the things we discussed was and how the situation budget just got so out of hand .
, which moved us into the deficit trillion dollar they created the huge deficit that year
chicken with
a loaded cannon
they 've got trillions of dollars to spend every year ,
and , in my opinion , they do n't do a very responsible job of spending that money .
for the moment ,
's and then
or it does n't seem that it 's going to make .
, do n't know
at all .
just do n't
how do you feel about crime in the city ?
living in the city actually
mine for my own safety
that 's right .
think it is bad in certain areas ,
, however , is not as high as it is in other areas of the city
are the crime
think can be done about the crime in the city ?
they had some impact , but not a tremendous amount
probably , and they need try to increase community involvement .
with that
are a lot of that crime
the way people think about it
that is probably true .
'd say it 's probably in the top ten in terms of crime
do n't think it 's as bad as a either l
as we have as much of the problem gang
that seems to be true .
you walk through the street on a given evening
it is
, do n't know
that 's true .
with a big stick
you never have been there before
do n't walk down an alley
just try to keep out of a bad situation yourself
but
times when you ca n't avoid that all
and then you 're
who only the thing had ever
a set where there was a number of people around ,
was much younger at the time
did n't know who had it
had that
but that 's about it .
actual robbery with a gun one
just a guy running
had my car stolen
maybe so that counts .
where was that ?
was
metropolitan
and there 's a lot of thefts car in that area .
have
when he got it back and his dashboard was sitting in the front seat .
had it
and some type superficial damage ,
but they did n't strip it
got back so it
than most
so do insurance pay for the body damage ,
or was
put everything together
the column of course , to steal the car
the column
and you can start it up pretty , basically easily .
this much about
your products been
have too many problems
goes bad just after
that one
have you had any lately go out ?
, bought my house new
really do n't have any recourse , and
had called and have so
you , so did n't get anything
even , were all the warranties out ?
the refrigerator warranty , are still good
but the ice maker itself , passed its three years ,
and it was three years , and two months .
we just moved into a new too house
so we had to buy all those , too .
watch out .
buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
the product and up end when being toxic and all these warnings .
using it just ended up
have gone wrong
usually have pretty good luck with appliances ,
within two days that all three of these stopped working , it was
the ice maker , and had to have a pump new
that is incredible .
so it was almost three hundred dollars for all three of them .
and at the same time they went out all ?
two days of
or two days .
it was n't a good week .
was pretty mad
all and plus have gone out of business ,
but they were still through that retailer ,
could have taken it
it is frustrating .
worry , because they were n't under warranty
it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all ,
a lot
three of those
one was under warranty ,
the other two , and were n't
products getting much better , though ,
is in the manufacturing
, the air bags safety
that is interesting .
a lot with the manufacturing environment changed
test everything after each assembly process
and so are
you do
if you 've got one test , you ,
assume you and by the results of the one test ?
every test
five a day
but we do test during the assembly product , ,
so , each assembly process right after it is done , has an inspection
we and then during the process
had use
in an automobile accident
think it 's a great idea , but
what all the good logical ideas take seems like to come about forever
we have to do through the government ,
it is incredible
spending even if the extra money on the car
we 're going to describe job benefits ,
, is the most important job benefits
would say the medical insurance group area as far as covering medical costs for yourself or family members
your company does have good benefits in that regard ?
i work for
almost the entire thing
the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of costs .
with it over the years
the cost of insurance going up
we 're me or now .
.
about how
, in my opinion , so
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage .
they usually sign a contract or something
did have surgery last summer and
and paid first day
, and have never seen
have so to say it really works
my doctor be in it
that 's right ,
is fairly young myself ,
first got into full time employment
and it is for me
know you and your body , and just have all the medical history
you comfortable with it
is
will go and just pay if that happens
you go to your own doctor
your benefits but not
you mentioned you work for a school system .
job flexibility and time off
, too , .
you talking about break spring
and having a lot of vacation that
is not a teacher ,
a secretarial executive
but do n't think the teachers could stand the stress all year long frankly
it cost no matter
we have break spring in two weeks ,
and do n't know who looks forward to it , the students or the teachers and the staff
what you do there do ?
is not actually
but we have a large research organization associated with the university ,
and that 's who
good a bit of
our own interests in
that 's good .
is that you and
we do have to work the day ,
but we do get off many days ,
and all we look forward to it .
the only reason
at the time , but because there
continue just to stay there
any things that you 'd like to see changed in terms of the benefits
.
and
the two main things
more or less so
typically in the winter , it 's probably cold to go out and do things like tennis too
, like to play in the summer time or in the spring , fall tennis
but it in the winter get pretty cold .
it 's so indoor mostly in the winter sports .
about how
is on a program exercise
feel like that 's been a nice real exercise in the winter time and .
first of 'd like to get off my weight .
'd like to get the weight off , and so
'd like to get into that really and then
and have
do n't
, not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down
but you are using weights ,
have ever done
it 's really fun .
to with weights aerobics
but it 's like low impact , just with weights aerobics .
you familiar with step or bench aerobics
,
but never have done it myself
have you do that
have
that is in the thing .
that 's the big thing ?
it was just regular aerobics at first ,
but now step aerobics or have kind of taken over bench .
is
they call it a low impact , aerobics
burn more calories at the same time off
does it and give you a real good workout .
's potential for to your knees injury , but
that and movement of
that could create a problem .
they think it wo n't ,
but you never know .
you do have healthy knees ?
my main weak
but have kind of care of that taken
had any problems in the past year or so
that 's good .
like you just sound .
that 's what he does , so
and his high tops
it would take only three or four days
you how to rehabilitate yourself learn to play that way just after
your exercise
it 's amazing how fast you take the inches off
and then the bike on the other day
but , it 's really amazing how fast
the muscle real fast
without weights for the first month
a and it is ,
so it 's a good workout .
it is ,
that really
so are looking forward
it 's quite cold .
been
walking throughout the whole winter
it was
how do you get most of your event current information ?
is going to school right now ,
, while and do n't get a chance to read the paper a lot
do and , like to do with it stuff other
sometimes are at work
and is that kind of helpful .
you keep on what 's going on up .
that 's true ,
my roommates and stuff people
is a housewife ,
have three kids ,
watch major network news ,
just the regular channel
just eight .
that is our channel here
that 's the eyewitness news .
it 's so kind of different .
it is kind of appropriate right now , because of the election stuff going on
seems the news but
they they 're going
basically them if a candidate can get follow
are the right way to get it
a lopsided very picture of what is going on
you just ca n't get a full picture of their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read .
the news it does n't cover that many stories , just too and
it just covers your basic violent crimes , and with weather and stuff your catastrophes ,
but other than that , you really do n't know what 's going on .
our current letters to come out on elections
do read that ,
study is running in our area ,
do study what 's going on in the economy and
too other magazines and .
science news to
because and that 's real good
, do n't really read
do n't really subscribe to anything else
read every month
have just friends
when we were in war on a reading of course in
the stories in the newspaper all but
just ca n't seem to find the time , but
but a tape cassette or something , when you could listen to it just not
, known
right now we get tickets to it
that 's going to be that crazy time of year here .
people want to hear about it
and they did so well last year .
a long time on sports
think that 's fine , and
would like to see more time spent on other things
, do n't know
wish they kind of separate it ,
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it
but do n't have cable
one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is
.
think and a unanimous verdict help ensure that
if you have juror one that 's very unreasonable in some way you would have a problem you would n't convict
have ever on a jury before you served ?
twice have
it was a pretty wild experience .
what sorts of cases were they ?
just small time cases
was so
they were .
they were n't
what was the verdict ?
did the jury
changed the one and
so it became unanimous after they turned it in
he then changed after they turned it in his mind and
but then it became unanimous .
since it was a civil case but really it did n't matter
you just needed a majority ?
what was the case other ?
that was
the other case , was just traffic
and it was seat
even and it did n't
did n't really even count .
is a college student
have n't been a jury eligible for very long age so
declined because it was a very bad time
to the juries like that
done at
but have n't
think the criminal jury system work pretty well now ,
but wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well .
do from what it
would think that it would go
you thought it turned out pretty well ?
was n't just and
is not
assumed that it would have been and just
so it was just kind of a zoo
someone had to figure out what was going on ?
that 's about what it was .
that is interesting .
work pretty well out in
they picked one person ,
it did so end up pretty well working out ?
it ended up working all right .
and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract ,
into very technical issues
wonder if the system works in educating the jurors whatever issue is under about discussion adequately and
them enough to know what 's going on really
you said it was just sort of a matter of some kind bank in .
they get the trailer that seemingly was their property
it was on his property .
money from the bank to buy
had n't and
so they came to get it .
and he would n't
they get it back
and it was
so they 'd already taken it apart .
so they left it there
it then later when they come back and rained and got in it all
they were so suing him for the money ,
started now
have you ever on a jury served ?
, served
a lot of the same rules
you ever served on have one ?
finally served on one last year
have been voting for years ,
and could n't
and finally was
so it was an interesting experience .
kind of
or
it was municipal court
of weeks a
.
it was a combination so
most of the time we spent sitting in the jury room around and getting to know the other potential jurors
and then , it was always
the judge hand down sentences did
or you folks did
the judge did .
have a hard time getting on a jury seated
and they kept dismissing me .
they do n't have to give a reason ,
they want to get the best mix for their case ,
all kinds of wild questions
that 's a science in itself .
called for drunk driving questions up
was part of it
.
because you 'd be too puritanical probably
that was it probably ,
with the person who got caught , more
do n't know
the sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair , was
if you think they would have been different .
was there never for any sentencing
we got into the jury room to decide the case , and
everybody that he did n't need to deliberate , because he 'd already decided the guy was not guilty , and he would never vote for guilty
so they appointed jury foreman me
told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we could n't get one member of the jury to deliberate
the whole thing
i bet that made .
it was funny .
, do n't know
did n't like not being able to deliberate
wanted to vote for the guy guilty ,
the other people and was kind of mixed
so the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again .
cost him a lot of money ,
is sure
how many members were on the jury ?
it was a six or members jury twelve ?
it must have been six .
kind of
it was always men twelve tried
for some crimes , but it is apparently
it 's a simple majority rules .
see 's
it on capital crimes that they have to be unanimous 's
probably on ,
, do n't know
had to do with drugs
the government , failed to prove its case really
and being fair to the person , if the government does n't prove its case , no matter how
and we have acquit him in both cases .
all they could do was to testify ,
pretty good
pretty good
drug in the place work
drug in the place work
, just before employment
but that 's about it .
have never
random drug in my business
had to do it
they started that about a year ago ,
trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff and .
beer and stuff at lunch time
with alcohol
with alcohol
they 'll check for alcohol .
once you start doing that stuff , you 're
that is interesting .
what type of field of work
is in the oil business
in the oil business
work in the office ,
so it 's pretty safe environment .
the automotive industry , which we make the safety bags for the cars , air bag
around a lot of explosives and we work .
that sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on .
because are all for it
they have with each of the explosives they use safety features ,
still , but it can be dangerous .
.
you are working in high risk industries , which you can hurt other people , that you need have that kind of stuff really
as long as
do n't have that a big problem with it
they do fire them ,
this is it ,
start having my problems with my company
i work for a private company
and the policy is
a controlling substance , then you
it is probably the same thing .
those things that
just you and then if you 're not worried about it .
that 's right .
and they do give you a second chance ,
caught or if
a little on the second chance
ought then if they 're going to give you the opportunity
when you 're a private company , but the rules do n't always apply .
around i work is
have n't run into anybody that 's been a problem
much like any lottery it works ,
everybody 's got
you could time it just right .
, he had alcohol on his breath ,
and is
that 'd be just as dangerous .
especially equipment , machinery and stuff around
that 's true .
had a beer at lunch time , but not
give any limits on alcohol ,
tell you the truth
do n't
they must ,
, have been paying attention
really do n't know
'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask
you can take too far
it was not only drugs ,
really do n't think it 's too many ,
a severe invasion of somebody 's privacy say , we 're going to look and then to decide whether you are worthy
really do n't see that 's a very valid thing for a company to say ,
would work if they were going to reject me on the basis of what is inside my body
for a company to reject somebody
suppose out some other way they found ?
does a test drug that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs
there can be false positive results and that sort of thing .
do n't think there 's any definitive this person
so we do n't want him here .
think it 'd be very necessary , though
want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when
it 's such a big deal
think it 's a whole trust issue
just ca n't see it
you ever be
have been
it 's very humiliating ,
is not in favor of drugs or against drugs speaking , and
it 's a pretty personal thing when somebody says .
during a job interview , had it
they convince me to want to work
is much about it and if you 're going to treat even before you 've got to know me me with this respect much
it was a job interview
and then you have
, and do n't want to look at it or something like pretty basic that you really
do n't know it 's a company 's business to regulate
these and not
that to be fairly offensive also but when they are not at work , .
ought if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt , then
if , and then they 'll notice it for other reasons .
that is exactly right .
along it just move if most people went down that line into regulating employees ' lives outside of work , down
are we not
you do n't want them to smoke ,
when somebody leave work but do n't think it 's the employer 's right to regulate their life style at all
do you think it should be illegal for an employer to do this
and do
think it should be illegal for them to want to do that
it is kind of the big syndrome brother ,
just that kind of scares me
for a company that did
has
if , and i sort of feel like an employer should .
pressed the button one ,
are we so
is
is that
have you had ever plan a family reunion ?
it was n't really a planning one ,
but it was a birthday
together a lot of family and then brought
and how you did feel it went ?
it went pretty good .
work in hotels
so i kind of know how to do these things .
used to
this getting together
what
it is usually my grandmother 's birthday , when we 've kind of our reunion family
she comes from a big family .
sisters seven
up and all
see 's
she has four sons and two daughters ,
up and all and they
so it 's a pretty big reunion ,
it 's about two hundred people , maybe .
was helpful in planning the birthday
the biggest challenge probably was getting a place where everyone could comfortably eat and everything .
a rescue squad building or something like that
for the rent and for soft drinks and
nobody really got so and
that 's good .
each person in the family and brought a dish or something .
, have a main meal
it was just pot luck .
it was kind of luck pot .
everybody brought their specialties
show off a little bit
gone first because she is such a great cook was my grandmother 's food and of course as always
how old 's she ?
she look probably like she is in her early sixties
she is , at that age
my nickname for her 's honey woman .
calls her
that sound .
have a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago ,
we sent out hundred five announcements , because our family 's large , quite like your family there .
that was a real challenge , and so
was president of our reunion family for two years , and
was n't very at that duty , for two years in a row , and
were planning advance
one thing , is helpful
are your family
but all my family live in the same county
is that
but it 's just kind of like
and , it 's so and such days from such and such date
everybody and just shows up .
that is helpful .
are you
.
my immediate family my parents and my brothers and sisters ,
because my dad was in the army
is so
nobody move away except us .
they really like it must there .
got out , as soon as
just this town is too small for me ,
you want to start
might as well
, is the ozone layer issue
that 's stuff even we never thought about three years ago .
and lots of it
its properties , was great with the machinery and
and cooling cycles
have they stopped that practice now ?
quite before we can undo this
that could spawn good several industries and help , pull us out of this recession ,
but you got to have people who can earn a salary to pay for this conversion .
how many families
and on automobiles and trucks
is too a type polluting deal
that is putting out a lot of dark smoking going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter ,
there 's a lot of pollutants we ca n't even see coming out of cars ,
are diesel fuel
is going to be around , because it does n't evaporate easily ,
its latent heat , are high
's , but at
.
bill ,
bill ,
and i every month camp at least one weekend
camp two three weeks a year
that sounds good .
'd say quite a bit i camp
.
, have a lot
where you do find to camp places ?
all our equipment with us
about how
we have five children ,
so we have tried to get out once a year and go on a out anniversary camp ,
we have gone up into the mountains
be alone up in the mountains
that 's good .
our boys and then old now enough
so , and they are
last time our twelve one year old , and went to the camp scout for a week
and they 'll be going so this year , both
and that is so
is that right ?
of do
they are very light weight
they are not very heavy
with you so
'll and
my bones getting so old
had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that
we saw a lot of in the morning and the afternoon deer
just .
of course so we do n't want to go hunting .
but we got to see out and about a lot of deer
all the time of course ,
armadillos and one thing is a big concern in the evening , at night , we have
with a heavy armor stuff type
we have those creatures that they like to go for a midnight snack hunting and down here .
you do n't put away all your equipment
or bite you or anything
if they will .
away from you , but if
any problem walking right by you if
fierce less than
should begin
can begin this ,
and the program benefit we have here is really good quite .
is
just about covering
you name it ,
have and for me that this is
so are pretty satisfied myself
what 's your situation ?
our benefits packaging and is n't .
is satisfied with it
we do n't have the vision care ,
we do have .
a professor there
is on the professional administrative and technical staff ,
,
so generous vacation very time and sick time , the main i thing like about the benefits probably be the
no doubt .
that 's good .
with the army research institute
and you got quite a few off holidays being a government organization .
but you do n't get that here .
two or three a year
that 's kind of
do n't know
what do you consider most important in terms of the different benefits ?
the health care be the single most important benefit
the rates that we keep paying keep increasing
is
think that 's a national trend , but
and do n't know what is the solution to it
it is bigger than the benefits just part .
it is kind of an interesting plan .
it is kind of cold though .
and the ones above would .
it 's so kind of like drawing this line
and if you have it
if , you 're kind of out of luck
but it was kind of an interesting show .
think you 're right ,
think health care , is probably the pressing one
do n't
sometimes dental costs , can be expensive , just as if not more about
along as a rider carried
is any more , but not sure that 's widely followed
is not sure ,
we have different plans that we can subscribe to under dental depending , two
and the cost between them is very little .
think it costs me something like a month for the dental plan dollars five
but it pays a substantial amount .
of the dental expenses the
and administration and for both
is that generally across the board , you do
it is .
for everybody and the retirement plan the
but the main difference is in the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued .
it is for the operating staff
how much vacation time
actually , is that
that is interesting .
of what kind of benefits they would cover things like that and that
is that right ?
you 're first .
plus for me , and it is
they are also important .
there is a progressive path , so
the motivation is n't really there for a lot of people , but not being in the commercial sector
pretty much for a specific job training
and from for just and then very little variation that .
that
the ability to in one sense have
we dealing with an institution
it is
is that maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution , perhaps even somewhat with the business
for a large organization , and also the security for long term employment aspect
that is interesting though .
necessarily the case
job security
, job security
of years a
but do n't know if it is so much anymore
some people have been there a long time .
we seeing here as well that
a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in institutions
no doubt
in one sense for us , it is where it makes the least noise that means it is often the lowest roles type support
exactly is that it .
where it cut back the most .
think that is one of the things too
management too many people
it 's very easy .
they aware of what all it took
and then they wonder why it does n't get done in the same amount of time .
those people there anymore
providing the speed for it
is important
maybe is that the majority of the importance , i guess .
because my perspective are from an institution ,
but there are considerable motivation for innovation , if you 're in the corporate world
although the more complex your structure the less difficult it is kind of carry some things through
and in a small things organization
it is more personal for one thing
a better cooperation team
probably ,
as in a bigger corporation think you are just a number
you up being your own person
if that 's their problem if then
person or help it
the organization instead of person being
how do you feel about by jury trial ?
with trials by recently juries very
in what way ?
in that it seems to me that .
have very little regard for the law
about with criminal or civil suits
was thinking primarily criminal cases
that 's a concern of mine .
would feel comfortable more in many cases with judges
like the idea of of your peers juries personally in that you get
my question ?
'd agree with that
too often
that 's a problem definitely .
you doing if it on the basis of which color representation you have
not in such cases
happen to know several judges now
and there 's
but the two other would give either the plaintiff or the defendant the full benefit of the law .
are concerned with
definitely with you
the same crime got unequal sentences .
this is very true .
more of an ability for selecting two different juries versus
and where it would appear the crimes was very similar
the one other and .
of course also is a lot of that the ability of the defendant to get a good lawyer .
is n't that the truth ?
my mind gone blank
you know where kill he says .
.
with it
have the benefit of
the judge or jury through argument
they very effective too
the person 's guilty
but his attorneys get him off .
enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
so do n't know
a little bit of
what one thing is new
is
.
taxes high
do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ?
no income tax and no sales tax
we tax business eight percent
eight percent
a very low tax rate
that
is still a student
work , so only
so get back a check
that 's nice .
from taxes
get a refund
it is ,
but it 's not much .
we getting value for it
one arm give
you know
taxes and politicians that there is a paper fly effect
go there .
not that much and comes back to you .
do n't know
they doing much with it
there are plans there
they have nice plans
but , they do n't always work
and then they try to raise taxes more
taxes but get
do n't know
is not really into politics
really do n't understand
raised the more
as much as
would
, would have you
you would take total you salary
under a certain amount
a set amount for
you would pay a flat tax just no exemptions , no deductions or anything else after you and up in your family 's .
the fat cats get away
the could be nice .
'd like to see something like that
it would
and it would put a lot of the tax attorneys
is sure they will fight it tooth and nail , and
it does n't seem fair to me .
it is n't ,
there is much out there who are fair , not
that 's for sure .
will agree to that
for
do you know what your state income tax rate is ?
twenty percent ?
, have no idea
my dad does it all for me .
you just pay .
she and work as a waitress
and she is attending full time college also
she and send her taxes to me
and i figure them up .
she has really no idea .
she gets a refund check
how do you keep up with current events ?
the news in the morning
what channel do you watch or what station ?
that is the one i watch .
n't
is a student
much time to read the newspapers and stuff
a lot of stuff through the grapevine that are n't too great sometimes really
is interested in any particular one
the radio really do n't have much news sometimes .
just music mainly
you have to listen to all news station to get any news at all pretty much
now is an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news , because they would have the wonderful investigative reports always
mainly go with popular topics just not basic news .
it 's something wrong .
looks like they are going for ratings than for actual news more .
probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
the farm report
report farm and oil reports
that 's pretty sad
killed
newspapers as bad as television
read the story
that like he started shooting in this cafeteria or something people were ?
the news and covered it hours after it happened
kind of
times of
x channel gives you the best coverage
we were on the scene with our team players
they were showing these dead people
it did n't seem like there was much of the story , but just the play on people 's emotions coverage .
everything
stopped totally watching local news
even the national news
very ,
what did you think of the coverage of the war ?
found it
you did ?
any sort of debate
or should n't have been there ,
they kept showing just how great
coming home and all the big parties
show that why did they show the guys n't
basically set the press ,
what you do have kind of pets ?
we have one rotten cat .
rotten cat one
it is my son 's cat .
heard a laugh in the background
that 's the boys .
do n't like it
do n't ?
like
this cat are more like a dog .
he is a one owner .
he likes boy one in the family
and that 's about it .
that 's odd .
how does he treat the other people ?
just stays away or usually run .
but he 'll follow my oldest around son .
when he is in the house , he will come up
and he 'll jump on his lap ,
he did raise him or something ?
we bought for him the cat
and he is so been the one who spent most with him the time .
owned a cat like that
had cats growing
usually either they and with that way or friendly to everybody
that is interesting .
so , it 's a weird cat .
abandoned pets at her house
saying it was free ,
and we picked up it
and it 's been an excellent dog ,
but it is my first dog
my wife while at home stays here
so that 's why we got it mostly .
that kind of your child 's right now ?
it is right now .
kind of
we have been trying for kids ,
have n't right now , but
, it keep her on her toes
you that have had dogs before ?
my brother
we did n't do a lot with them .
never felt like it was mine or anything ,
you could n't do anything .
we have always when a dog
we have mostly mutts , and
like one or two mix
those dogs be the best dogs
that 's what we found .
but , it 's a really good dog .
, do n't know
better or something
it 's just an accident .
from my son 's friend down the street
you would ever want a dog in the family ?
would
and he was too big just when we got him for our kids
and when we moved into our house was the first thing we wanted to get
and it was a dog
and he was just too big .
the kids could n't handle him
was still and
and my wife was working
and was working
and just so we did n't have time to train really him
so he was too big for the kids to handle ,
tied up just
it is kind of an animal shelter
but he takes in just a few the animals
and
and some he keeps .
so we took him up there
he keeping him and ended up .
have
just about a year ago we saw him
and so we asked him about it one day
had ever in my life
with him
he would have been a great , great dog .
he just needed a lot of time .
how do you feel about gun control ?
should guns
is to get guns
to
even now known
is a gun you can get a gun , especially if you have the money but
know you released from the day before a mental hospital in a lot of states , could be just be insane obviously and
but have your legal right to get a gun .
did n't know that
that 's pretty scary .
feel about it in rating to ten it one
'd probably say about a five
probably would be
it 's a good safe number to pick .
do n't know how they can really enforce the laws any better really
do think some people need for protection and stuff them
them wanting to have them
out there again but then it is
it
per capita murders incredibly lower than the united states
so it 's really kind of a complex problem .
is not really sure how bad
have not really that many problems with it
was apparently , but
in one of the top three for murders in the last few years
do you own a gun ?
about getting one
probably would n't get a gun hand
in the downtown area
that 's true .
they 're going to buy they
they going to miss the person
they 're going to shoot through wall five
the direction of
pretty much
, then do n't go far that
a wall will stop it pretty much .
and my dad gave me a gun
did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it , but never
finally ended up so giving it back to him
do n't want it
and if you 're not going to teach me
that really do scare me .
and you point at the person it
that person
and they get it from you .
the person that you are about to kill then
set off them .
a real danger to them
is going to be stop you if their first reaction and then
ended up giving it back to him
do n't know how to use it really
and did n't just want the responsibility
it did at a cafeteria or something happen ?
it just makes guns
selling guns to people
what type of budget do you or your family have ?
do n't know we 've really a budget
a set amount
actually there is a way .
got my wife
that a set amount and that have
probably a tighter control budget than
is
do n't know if that 's an excuse for not having a tight budget ,
really do n't need to
do n't need to
that only the
so it make it easier a little bit .
that 's right .
also and try to save a certain amount each month as well
an idea of
are pretty consistent from month to month and
and are pretty well aware of it without having to maintain a budget for it actually
what we use have a very strict budget
had four kids
and we planned out how much .
kind of how much anticipated things were going to be .
who now is interesting one aspect of that i kind of fence
are for instance
every i six months have to pay car insurance .
every i six months have to pay my taxes .
take a set amount
a lot of saving in
, and also have got a checking account besides that
of two hundred and twenty dollars a month an
two hundred and twenty dollars to it
have then when the tax bill comes
that is a way of budgeting
or more longer range
a targeted that amount
probably would like to buy a car new within a year
so , i kind of have an amount in my mind
making every effort to put a little bit away
not only for buying them , but for
we 've got two cars .
my wife had a car
pick truck
every three or four years to buy
is constantly making payments car , and
is making payments car , but
get
is actually and
it 's so kind of a never thing ending ,
that you are paying for two at the same time , not so
have you thought about leasing ?
about it
do n't use it for my business
.
my wife use for just pleasure hers
just go back and forth which is only ten miles to work
i guess
the best returns after
the longer , of course , the more profitable it 's own it yourself .
you 're right .
have been
they kind of start going
and you got to put stuff in them .
that 's right .
mine 's seven years
rough and last year was a year for it
have a number of expenses
brakes , shocks and all that ,
went through that whole set just so last year
a slow period before
those things can really
so that it does n't kill .
what line of work
what 's your view .
what 's your view ?
have a hard time
that 's true .
even if still , it 's going to be black market all over the place ,
that 's right .
that 's right .
do n't know
do n't know
, should n't make
it is ,
just living down now here .
here down a couple years
just living there down ?
but
there 's a lot of hunters here .
know
and what we always and use hunt go out
would go for a total ban on all weapons ever
do n't know
think it 's ridiculous
it does n't sit with me very well .
do n't know anymore
, never know there you are out
it 's just for purposes self protection
then and of course , is the issue hunting
that 's good .
is in control program for a company up here
we do schedules , for programs , scheduling programs .
what do you do ?
you guys do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything
have been down here
'd like to go bird hunting , but
quite a bit
but do n't know
that 's right .
is about eight or nine
with you there .
no doubt about it
if they can get it , keep criminals from having guns which they ca n't anyway
is not for it
of laws a
they have a waiting period where you buy one
that 's a week and
and then have a record and things like that
think that 's a pretty good idea
, do n't know
that 's not a bad idea ,
but then you can get around that always again .
the black market like
you always be able to get around
it is one of things
but do n't know
some forms of guns probably should
just like is not real why anybody would need a full automatic weapon sure
n't either
been
it kind of take the sport out of hunting .
what can you do with that , that
you might do the same thing .
and it 's like it do so .
it takes the sport out of it .
would rather have a bow anytime for much
have done some bow hunting
and get
think it 's more of a challenge and
but do n't know
it keeps the shell makers in business
but do n't know
about to be
me too
is about the same way
and have yet or whatever you .
guys central you
how the weather is up there ?
it 's not too good .
it is ?
up to get down to about ten or twenty degrees this time of year around here
stuff like that ice are starting to melt and
is up for the year just here
and it is
most of my news from newspapers
do n't
sometimes a holding of copies of it but .
about how you ?
most of my news coverage off computer networks
usually once television news in the morning
the front page of the wall street journal and .
that is interesting .
you said computer networks .
what sort .
is fairly of knowledgeable
that is interesting .
available at my office
so , it is , no fee or subscription to read either at my leisure
and it 's sort of by category .
can read a certain business or topics for example
it or is something is a little bit different from that ?
it is similar to that ,
so , that is interesting .
thought that was a pretty good way to get news and
you do read any magazines news or anything like for sort of a long term analytical broader more sort of approach that ?
actually .
do n't know how to describe it
relevant to me in a broad more sense
it is a weekly but not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things .
in general except for the raw news wires
in what way ?
have a problem with their viewpoint
personally think there 's a strong bias in the media and
you wo n't offend me .
like a liberal type of bias
absolutely .
after
trained to write
that 's a liberal field at least from academia and
they make mistake on anything at least technical generally .
that 's right .
it does n't .
usually if , they make
they are telling me lies .
by , do you mean honest just mistakes
do deliberate sorts of things or
.
toward a particular liberal view that they have
to give you an example we will go out of the printing media .
about to give you the impression that what they are talking
is that
he does that .
, have n't doing them that
but whatever
but usually n't
do n't have either access
did during the war gulf
you would n't
that if you just during the war gulf watched it probably would n't tell you much .
just about , except the three networks
are
and do you have a family ?
is to both questions
do you and your wife and
.
the ones come every month
those into a spread
kind of what sort of range on
.
what do you do ?
is that
about every three months or so ,
from the largest bills
i part time working at night
and my husband work full times days
we have four checks , and so
we paid every week
that , and so does help
that helped a lot .
and then we do n't have ,
is so it ear
out
's every pence
we found that the best that work
cut and cut up the house payment in half
up , and between all
all the checks ,
we taking a huge sum out of one
the next check then we are real short pay and
a on kind of the unnecessary expenses
that 's true .
we kind eat out a bit more than we should have ,
things get out of hand
we thought it to be helpful really .
because of this and stuff like that really pay off
it helped you to focus where your money goes
is sure you felt before you got on a budget , the same frustration and
all the money to do bring
and then you , which did all that money is saying go .
that 's a lot of money ,
where it does go ?
and we did this .
we real consistent with this
but we did it for about a month
we wrote down everything we bought and every pay check
and so we could see where every pence went
and it was
real with it
does it help
the other thing that helps we 're
us and if it and then forced to stick to that amount
that sounds like a really good idea .
it really and helpful
or anything like that
we have n't .
our initial goal was to retire completely just for car payments and credit card debt and all of that debt .
where we could start thinking about it
that 's good .
is that
from the university a year ago
finally so .
a student
to school
you do like ?
lots of
like country music , of course
so quite a bit .
into rock and roll myself
they have that type of music ,
but they have different words just
, too , so , .
not really ,
rap music and .
do you like rap music ?
not really .
not really .
can tell we 're here together
have a lot of friends like
what kind of rock music do you listen to ?
you do listen to that really heavy metal stuff
have friends like
what ?
a little bit of it
the heavy metal stuff guess
her too
a concert of of hers times a
actually have never seen in concert her
she put on a pretty good show
she does .
she 's real good .
like so
some country music
it is
country my wife left the music is like me me , my dog left
do n't like that
more of the new real ones
he is fine .
like
do n't care for the older the dog left stuff me
even know who she is really
but , have you ever been concerts that you like to any of them ?
with they
tour on
, since the late sixties
just thought and
they are still together .
they are still making albums .
did n't know that
that is interesting .
up in age there on
one of them die off they
they have a really bad time with players keyboard
they keep on dying
and they keep replacing them on
and the new one is in this thirties .
pretty rough
have seen picture of them
they do n't look as rough as the rolling stones actually .
the posters tour of
and put in leather jackets and blue jeans
are saying
they come on the stage
they do n't even
they just so out of it
that .
so do n't know
lately see any concerts
there are going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste
it 's not new too .
they did n't really propose any solutions .
facts to give and things like
was and recycling printing news of
and they could
they were able to sell it for some amount per ton
have now at this stage of the game where they 've got into recycling and
though that 's a problem common .
we are doing some here in cash valley , the community here .
we got a kind of a nice set up actually
it 's not a fire hazard
and they can use actually as the community can get to them as much recycled paper .
that 's good .
so is one of the real keys to getting recycling for paper , or something like that to go
they putting it even these days in the roadways
is they now and
do a study by two for the government departments
one was environmental protection
and the other one was
we putting landfill into our
the solution that he came up , it was quite amazing really , and
he says the best thing to do with plastics 's burn them .
who actually 's the conclusion , plastics he came
so it takes up a lot of space
and there are very little value in actually doing a lot of the recycling energy ,
but if you can burn it and use it , produce electricity there is
was so his solution
it is carbon
so that make sense ,
a fuel carbon of some sort ,
but what about emissions ?
and it is more than even paper , or something like that .
more energy in
he did n't deal with that .
he said burn it just .
he did n't talk about cleaning up or anything like that it .
so it 's not very practical .
it is interesting .
, i bet that at the conference then
real
it did change for you anything ?
not too much
got
we 're talking
first of
quite a bit older than
but .
think exercise is extremely important
exercise on a regular basis and .
?
what type of exercise do you do ?
.
you familiar with it
it is a national company
they different from aerobics
it or is the same thing ?
it is
you up
and then working up to a high heart rate
go down again and then .
and every day
does it only two or three times a week probably
's three times a week
this is a club and
or do you to a group ?
are it
buy you and at a time to
just go and then .
go at thirty nine in the morning
do you go with friends
or do you go alone ?
by myself
that and is one of the frustrating things go with me
and do n't exercise
or they might play tennis
a player tennis
many people want to do that
young mothers
young women , with small children
what do you do ?
do n't really
like playing basketball
's every day and
you do play every day ?
much .
my wife
who do you play with ?
with you play
by myself around just
and that 's about it .
high school
have n't done much , but when
do n't have a problem
, have to do more aerobics
but do n't have a problem with weight
and not to gain
that 's good really
some people from
, do n't have a problem with weight either
i exercise
exercise
how do you stay thin
and it is because
,
, but also
but you 'll come ,
but as you get older you will .
but do n't know
it might not .
because everybody 's been telling me that too
so far it and n't
you have to weigh yourself and just to keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get too high constantly
sports a lot
active in that way
but you do n't play any other sports but basketball
basketball ,
too bad it is not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby ,
.
but , you do ski ?
i use , to
but it got too expensive ,
really did it ?
a lot of people
the time but .
other things
they come up here .
ski and .
there is a place where you can ski ,
is thinking about where you can ski over the state line
is
have never
have never
it is kind of funny .
they do
know
you can
people to
most of these people but enough so .
and is
have never used before
did aerobics all the time
and was
just they started a recycling program here
actually , this is my first experience with recycling program
always but instead everything away .
they do n't pick up at the curb it
they doing up there
no curb up of any of the recycled products
just as a recycling operation and then others
then soft drink primarily bottles and
able to take to one of the rehabilitation centers so we and
the deposit 's only on drink stuff .
and that kind of thing
and glass , soft drink containers
we do have one of the metal scrape dealers who will accept tin and aluminum cans as well
so it is fairly extensive ,
because it is the initiative of the individual person , but then again
you giving these products to the handicapped group
the handicapped group is getting the money and
they some home distributing the funds back to you
there is actually for both the opportunity .
will and then they in turn
that 's very cool .
think it 's mostly cans and
there may be bottles as well ,
but not cans beer , soda cans and what
able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people who need it desperately
partly because of our climate .
but we do n't have much of a situation where we might call homeless people .
on welfare and unemployment insurance , and that kind of thing
they do with as well papers news do it ?
they 've done it some ,
quite an extensive network of
virtually all of the shopping centers
put together a long term financial planning and monthly budget
you familiar with that
using it once myself
but decided the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping up to date that
actually because is what will happen my wife
to doing all the arithmetic
so it helped that really with .
it is similar problems
but we have just one the book check
as much as possible
will and occasionally
but it does n't really
range planning on
recently until just .
so we needed to start doing more of that just for saving .
we try to put away just for that two and four thousand a year .
that 's pretty good if you can do that .
known
have a daughter 's ten
put much really away
we can consider putting away for college some , but is where our financial income is enough
we going to be starting in the fall a regular payroll deduction
'll be putting away for the college fund and then
sounds good
my wife worked until we have a family
are we now and then
to find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to do it .
kind of enforce .
and just took on a full time job , recently
almost full time
that sounds good .
about how you ?
many people get
but that is interesting .
there were or another ?
got it as well
and it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in
sent back mail so
we 're talking about the experiment
probably need try to get back on the topic
it 's hard to talk , but
we could talk about some of the long range goals
what other long range
advanced degrees at
factor that if in
it seems like every year just my employer gives a little bit your tuition reimbursement back .
to reimburse one hundred percent
and it is now
how about
what do you do with your budget ?
do do ,
it is under chaos at the moment .
do n't really
and hoping that the car does n't collapse
that 's true .
but
really do n't have a budget at the moment
can afford to spend each month
that unless the visa bill gets
it goes through the moon , and then
that 's sort of a problem .
the credit clear
much of it on that
of how to put away some savings and stuff like that
you can afford to get a house so ?
we 'd like to do that some day .
we have this dream .
but , we do n't know how long it will be a dream .
we are real happy to do n't have we ,
save every month
what do you and your husband do ?
are
cause overseas we have quota support
and it is cheaper to live overseas than it is live here .
and it does n't
.
overseas , where you would be going ?
how long you would be there ?
about four years
we 're career
seas for four years over
for a year and then we come back .
go over four
we back for a year
with what church ?
who
there was a fairly large building who belongs .
in translation
we will be .
which is the first step
come home
always , wanted to do translation
it is easier but , as long as .
you do n't have kids hanging you and stuff around .
true ,
true enough
have a smattering of about ten different ones ,
did complete a survey in one area
can do better in it , but in about five
are pretty good and
but it 's
and is
picked up and it just off the street
but did n't
got a direct translation
and said
are not going to tell you
said to him
but did n't ask him either
must have been terrible .
you do
think it on the individual basis vary
there are sometimes
may not
that 's true .
sometimes so , it 's not
, sometimes it can be a benefit if it is for a short time
if it is especially after an acute illness .
that 's true .
never thought of that
good for just periods short of time
that 's true ,
the acute hospitals sending them out much faster than what they 're really able to
really .
them longer than a week
there are so some good to it .
too , it is sometimes
the families do not necessarily know what to do with them
what do you mean ?
they do n't want to take and the responsibility
will so they
that 's true .
there are so too both sides to it .
what do you think ?
and it depends on how sick the person is too .
what you are capable of ,
if to take a family
would like it personally
would like to take if my parents were ill get home
that 's not always possible .
that 's true .
but 'd like to do it until it gets impossible to the best of my ability
because , it 's not economically feasible
that 's true .
can be good
depends just
you need check them out ahead of time .
and then there are also
known
a special home for that
is
trained for that type of problem
they 're doing with that .
different types of
is not really in my grandmother .
she and liked the idea of moving there really .
she 's ill not yet
but she worked as a volunteer for about ten years there
and her family being a burden
she is very independent .
she is so
in the country 's it out
right now because she and really enjoy it .
gives her a little bit of her own independence
but she still have a security there .
some support
those people do get sick
so if it will be like family around her .
that 's right
some of them like that too
on a lot of activities going for
like a sick place it 's not so sort of
she love it .
she has a great social life
she and
and it is in the mountains
it is beautiful and
have something that and
those choices and sometimes can
'd like to have a short work week ,
we can start off there .
get just
we get to it
i just press one then ?
think a short work week 's real nice
about how you ?
right now , is just a student
part time
have work in the job force before , but
you just do n't have any time to do anything .
that way everybody and then would have a holiday three days .
and that would make a bigger market .
we 'd have more recreation .
people would have time to do it .
less of
we 'd have less crime .
we 'd have to build prisons less less police force .
it makes sense to me all .
there may be more crime if people have more leisure time .
it 's not clear .
that 's a possibility .
one of the problems they are facing now , a lot of people now is the small business ca n't offer health insurance
and it 's too costly
is what 's happening and
a specific rate
it 's called a group ,
then is what happens
so they have to cancel just life insurance .
they have to cancel everything .
is
and then all the people do n't have any insurance coverage .
but is satisfied with my job
is an engineering student
i working for my instructor and
and is not a typical student
's older
is in my thirties
have a lot of job experience and so
my instructor and because he can just tell me on that
give me access
do n't have to have
just ca n't really deal with that
what kind of jobs have you to do ?
in computer science research
and just have been doing for a few years now that
my job has
to conferences for instance
to me a really important thing is
right now get
and that 's good really
that 's just great .
you have what you might call
you are a person who is doing things type computer and you have the knowledge
and you get
's into computers too
when you have the knowledge , you 're not going to be let go ,
in time this
generally do n't
my personal opinion is
they do n't have to go out and get a real job ever .
just stay in their current job
you know
with both of those things
but do you see ?
by putting limitations on some of the problems you could slow down term .
not just at
some senators
and do n't know which ones ,
they have a job
they never have gone out in the real world
they pay ,
they are supposed to be my servants
less than
there is
think that 's true ,
think that 's always been true , however ,
that 's true of the presidency too
we be able to get along with the president turnover ever eight years , or four years
there 's a lot to learn ,
their toes and a little bit up
think two years is too short
it would
or you would increase the length of each term of a congressman .
we tackling a massive ballot every four years
every time , do n't work
all the other states doing it at the same time
think that 's true ,
of that coin the flip
do as far as the world
is a very large , very high profile agency and
it might be only
but that 's a hour two
and think it 's a mistake to move large agencies like that
or are
, do n't remember
the united states than
that is officially .
we know all that 's not necessarily true .
think some small number , seniority or of years , but
think there 's an institutional memory that you need maintain
heard on the radio back a few weeks ago
one of the radio stations over
how you like new jersey ?
it 's pretty good .
you get closer to the coast here ,
it is
is about thirty miles
, other part of new jersey exist
even a few miles out
and you got farms and everything
, do n't know about you
consider automobiles to be , probably the prime contributor
there 's a lot of contributors ,
but it seems automobiles probably would do more than their fair share of that .
.
a large number of them on the road
they are all going ,
a lot of them and .
a big issue is a lot of states
is the inspection even once a year .
the car 's in the accident
and muffler fall or something off
guy and keep along for long period of time after that driving .
rather than gasoline .
are hoping that comes along quick
about the other day time and how fast that 's going
it is coming , though from cars .
think that 's a contributor definitely
to go ahead .
the third less industrial
want and
basically they do n't want to have to pay for our mistakes if that make any sense
those joining arguments
, but do n't know
that 's kind of an interesting situation there .
it 's so kind of an interesting situation .
it 's not a real good one actually .
the destruction is the main source of what is clearing the atmosphere out and replacing some of the pollutants rain forest
that source of
you to be in a long time big cities
have been in the east coast , mostly
pretty hard hit
that is one of the worst .
have been pretty lucky , but
and there , you can tell it is getting worse .
because there is not in the way of heavy industry that would be causing it much that there , it is almost all automobiles
and there is not that much in terms of public transportation down there .
there is ,
every day , for one
a day one or two papers
every evening at
give to the united way
donate to that just
for cable
take away a addiction
off most sources of
incomplete pretty coverage
as many as possible sources
much of what is going on a clearer picture
is what really is still
read you ?
the local newspaper
was
so she really needed to look at the help
the newspapers compete with a lot of other sources of news
and do n't know ,
gone down in the last ten years or so
the sixth grade
it is at least second or third grade , sometimes
pretty low
, but do n't know
that 's pretty good .
in the car is a long enough time to listen to it ,
seems to be a lot better than your major network news and that kind of thing
he , is leaving
one of them are leaving .
they are pretty good , too .
that invasion have
was
, but do n't know
it still is a lot of a lot of hype
that was a joke .
, known
had some visitor
it is , if you 'll really want that ,
but that is not really providing you news .
a media event than
is the news you would get from any other source
kind of
it is , really
, you 're going to hear somebody then
that 's true
this thing to
it is free inside the company ,
it 's called intellect
actually read the actual articles
was
the for stuff and for me
i
outstanding and every two or three months
does it more than three times a year , but
you do use a computer ?
work with them all day
is in computer science ,
everything on paper
are doing because it 's all pretty round numbers
pay off when
while he was gone and got off
really is so rent , utilities , insurance ,
so they come in ,
pay ,
that 's it , and
that 's about the extent of it .
do n't really have this major budget or anything
just real careful what with the money
is that
it 's pretty straightforward .
and fancy making budgets
if , you 're not in real good control
like credit cards and a lot of debt
you buy something on credit
twice as much for it
paying off the bills because that way it 's just like using credit cards for everything
keeping records of anything else
do n't have too many weaknesses ,
found out , but a credit card
if you 're a woman , and you are a sale person , is something
it is it
go , grab it
you do n't have the money , then use a credit card ,
of them credit cards
guess if that 's a weakness , that 's a good thing to do .
that was my weakness .
it was n't bad ,
did n't have thousands of dollars and like that ,
just learned that was n't for me
but
little my own business clean thing type
you do find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that
it 's hard not ,
what it 's going to have to go for that month
it at all and is not that hard .
that 's good to know .
my own income tax
do you ?
do n't understand the idea of paying somebody to do
having to pay somebody to do it
all you got to do is to read the little book they send
just the form
a lot of them and
it is dumb .
but n't
so mess , with it .
but do n't use a calculator either
using a calculator or computer , too much stuff like that
do n't have that many , things to add
too many people use a calculator
if they make a mistake , later because they were n't paying attention .
they have a number you can call and , in
called in other once every week or
will and
do you do that ?
we have the same thing .
too
always my balance and my book and .
real often .
,
your views on capital punishment
do n't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it 's
and it is eating us
capital punishment in
we do practice capital punishment ,
the nature of the courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it 's a very long haul before anybody 's executed ever , but
it costs to execute somebody than it does to keep them more .
think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily to other people who would see a deterrent
of it the
's , but not sure how successful
maybe ,
what kind of work do you do ?
, is a research engineering
a school
elementary school
going to be in spite of everything we can do criminals
course , you could n't
but , we 'd have fewer decisions to make .
that is probably true ,
but , pumping more money into the school system , is a good thing
is not just about talking in the school system
.
kids just ought to be taken
the institutions , do n't work well that
are all these kids through my office but
hundred five of them good , solid kids
a lot of their parents totally irresponsible
so that is a difficult situation .
just those kids going down the road and .
but some of them have already been in youth centers .
are talking about necessarily , and not
is not sure the school system should be the agent of all the social action
think that is one reason we have problems in schools ,
some of them and
because but is a lot of it .
but that 's
that is probably true .
two or three kids today
that is not an easy solution
there are no easy solution for that .
do n't know there 's an easy solution ,
that 's true .
is sure it is ,
that 's true .
capital punishment certainly is n't going to solve a lot of problems
you for it
in some cases is for it
in certain crimes .
what kind of crimes would you use it for ?
any mass murderer type
that recently
read about that .
all the civil rights people in arms about it up
think we need more of it , definitely definitely
'd too agree
for
because , the country 's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients .
they do cover diseases like that ?
think
if not only , will they not give you a policy
a database of
so you 'll never be able to get insurance ever again .
but that 's why they should have started doing stuff before .
since still are still probably a lot of
that 's a good one .
n't really
did a kind of thing on research and stuff aids research ,
we are doing much at all , and not really
most of what gets raised , it is not really federal movement ,
by conscious communities and things like that
private organizations
and , they get donations from the community and from corporations around the city for aids research and that kind of thing
, do n't know
, do n't know
do n't know what the likelihood of that is ,
probably would agree with that
so do you think it is more important to spend money on research or for support of people ?
that 's a good question , fish .
, do n't know
and , it is not really necessary until the disease reach its final stage
think that the most effective support they could get is for other people would be to try to understand the community and
and do n't know ,
research is
do n't know
do n't know , fishing
you do
is it really is being used today ,
because it 's not cost the people effective because of the amount of time doing any real good for anything purpose
it is more expensive to kill than keep them in prison for life
because you 've got all the expenses prison plus all the legal expenses .
at the moment or committing them is either crimes of passion mostly
or they think they are not going to get caught
it is kind of like the aids phenomenon ,
do n't need to care about this
never is going to get caught
on the individual basis
by putting him in prison for life , there are still a possibility that he will get out again .
one way or another
if , there is not that possibility .
is , if there 's a chance that he might do things in prison and redeem himself somehow , but
do n't think he could ever redeem himself ,
in some cases , but
going to do about
twenty , thirty years after the fact of getting evidence , especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence
we guess killed the wrong guy .
once , it 's a little on it difficult to go back .
you can
going
, these people care again , and
every day .
, the risk is almost not there
we 're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something .
the vengeance of it
and is , we have capital punishment ,
it 's lot of blacks .
also a lot of young people
the victims ' families and things to
, if it should n't make any difference to the victim 's family .
probably 'd feel differently obviously , if
and not to be a danger to society
and by keeping them in prison , you do also have the possibility of making restitution .
you will work your job prison
will go to the victim 's family and
more and more things like schizophrenia
of you really get to the question back
someone is responsible for his actions
society made .
see 's
mine is pretty easy actually .
ca n't afford it right now
of that fact .
it is the best in the class for the cheapest amount of money car .
and it seems to blow away just the competition .
terms
, power
it just got the top rating .
see 's
over all of them
like the styling
of them actually that
they be for it really good cars
ca n't afford it
so you are talking .
is a graduate student
and let
do n't make
you can
you 'll have plenty of money , and
you can
we 'll see then .
right now is
but it 's unreliable fast
get it
use for that
'd use it for both
that 's what kind of track ?
a lot of times
turns , hard acceleration
and it is interesting .
would so guess
you thinking about buying
the legend
and was there this summer
they have the whole philosophy ,
of course ,
of course .
you buy their car
it was interesting .
and it was
no two of them and alike .
so it 's
, do n't know
like better
it 's not realistic .
it 's a toy .
let
for what kind of driving you
just work , short trips .
so it 's pretty minimal .
that is cool .
a long time last .
are looking for
that 's good .
they 're going to hit up for just all kinds of things you .
the factory were nice
something on the order of three a series
higher up then significantly
probably
can imagine that
they are
the government would
and that 's more
what you have
that , the general idea to spend , during a time of recession for the deficit spending pick up the economy
they are running under a deficit spending while we 're not under a recession , it
coming to counter the deficit that we are running , in
so is that kind of a basic thing of economics
was the question
just .
very expensive commodity
police and fire department and
they need make a living .
to a great extent , public servants
not paid to society
with that
i guess ,
right now is a student
a whole lot of money
a state school
paying taxes all that long
of it , and everything the education
getting money back up , but usually
you 're very fortunate .
.
need it too
in any more than
we pay in a substantial amount .
we do n't regret paying taxes .
of a regressive tax , a progressive tax a
progressive tax , and does not give incentive to make people
by that , the more income
taxes more
it should be a flat percentage
and that percentage ought to be an equitable amount .
totaled them all up and
even though there are taxes on different things you spent
you are paying like when you buy a tire
there 's a lot of hidden taxes .
every time you pay .
a lot more visible portion of
in other taxes more percentage
there was that ,
one of the democratic candidates have a proposal for doing now away with all the tax codes that they have and implementing a flat percentage , something like that .
if , it would encourage people to make
what people need in my opinion understand jobs and
business people here is my break ,
are not going to work any harder and make or create any more jobs
you think you are talking to ,
you 're talking to an employer .
found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting actually
actually agree that 's an interesting thing
for civil suits it 's not unanimous ,
for criminal suits but it 's unanimous ?
that actually , too
i wonder ,
state felonies versus
do you think that 's that an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous ?
as to what is the requirement for an acquittal
a unanimous vote of
that would be an interesting change .
think so that it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision , if anything ,
'd agree with that
for about five years
actually that that would be very interesting thing to do .
would like to do that
have been out here twenty some years
, have been called different three times and
because there have been a number of people always
any of the questions and .
think that would be good really also
more to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else
does seem to happen from i people
and , in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire of people
interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases
because the vote one does n't mean anything except the ability to have a verdict not for or trying
i
of the movie twelve angry men
you ever seen that movie ?
once .
he is the one , and
to the conviction
and he held on
me ask you the question
a long term budget
right now is in college
is on study work and
and so my budget comes from my dad 's help .
he helped me a lot out
got and
that is so kind of hard to have a budget .
my mother does n't
just what her budget is planning
,
.
's kind of in a different situation ,
went through that , too , but when
, trying to get through college and
of children a
pretty much to a budget to
is on a salary
so do n't get any overtime or anything like that
but , we have
and we have to make sure every dollar we have 's spent accordingly
and we to stick to our budget monthly is we do have pretty much ,
the insurance premiums and
of every month the
we and also try to set aside for bonds money and
an emergency fund
for about ten years
that sounds good .
, what kind of budget there is always
's discretionary income , which we use for the rest of the month ,
very well to work out
too long on the money on
and try and stick with that
that 's good .
and , is nice thing about it , my wife excellent in that
we work together , both
we have a budget , both
stick and
and there 's no surprises in that .
with two kids , that could be hard .
actually have kids four
four !
of kids a
have
have little boys four ,
four boys .
bet .
bet .
it 's just
my parents and three years ago
have gotten through college , and
was still in high school , but
paid for my mother and while my parents were together
had she and then before the divorce
and have to spend it all on getting another house
my dad so now are paying for all of my college .
, is a music major
you in in college
is a sophomore
you , is a sophomore
you have more a few years .
about , two and a half years
good for you
good for you
stick with a budget
it is sure .
knows how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks
and do n't spend over that
books and music and sheet music and stuff
there is always books to buy music .
lab fees and all
a starving artist , yet
do n't plan on being a starving artist
is in college
there is enough of those in the world ?
that 's because they are not real educated usually .
they ca n't afford to have a really good job .
not very well
the starving ones
there is enough that if you 're educated enough , then you can make out there .
that 's true ,
that 's true .
found out that
for the education of my children
what did you major in ?
plenty about planning a budget
how many kids
think we 're going to talk about parents spending time with their children
so this is the big issue with us .
like care and quality time day said
anyway .
you do n't have children
's , but
for two and a half years
trying for about two years
but no luck
hopefully ,
do this long distance
but actually is getting a call
possibly could take on call waiting
ask you
'll be right back
excuse me , just a moment
they 're going to get mad .
she had another call .
is
do you have a lot of activities with your kids ?
do n't want to be a unilateral conversation this
but
.
my husband , and i work both
fourth , and third grade ,
the school years and
they are
the kids , they
they and
and , they have all their own activities
really in our personal situation
our children have .
so they are pretty good kids ?
is sure that is coming , though ,
wonderful kids but .
can talk about us
we had nine kids in our family .
we have eight boys and one girl .
you have eight boys and one girl ?
he owned his own business
so we worked with him most of the time .
that is so how we spent most of the time with him .
that was
came from a family of five
had four brothers ,
only the girl
everyone and asked if always .
never felt
always thought in fact
was going to say
usually busy for survival
do n't know
it 's an interesting problem .
is a pediatrician
my husband , is a physician
about this a lot
what is best for them , and their family
have jobs that helped feel when my children were very young and
is a better mother and
that really .
for our children some things that
and have a real sense of priorities
it sounds like a rationalization
really think it is true for our family , but
work very well
it is
my wife stay home
there 's no question ,
think that 's really the best
if a woman 's happy doing that ,
put it quite that way
and would not
with a young child home
be a mother
did , but it
i sort of worked half time .
have very flexible hours
nursed all three of our children until they were least at a year
all the time to mothers is one of the things
the alternative situations that we have in them and .
it sounds like a rationalization ,
around lots of other children
they and to share .
of attention the
we 've at the same time , but
help
that 's good .
a like you 've sounds .
your wife , do right now she work ?
not right now .
we just moved down here .
is still
that 's no problem here .
we really liked it up there
just do n't
that 's a good question .
one for a crime he committed die
to that many other people that
and try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment
but he 's against the death penalty .
kill if they did something to his wife , not
but even in that situation , he would hope that there would be people around him that would keep him from doing the things .
it 's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent response reason .
well when people wanted to see if he were going to go for a gut level reaction
for punishment
perhaps not in
but it in theory fit in .
you ca n't obviously reform them , if you put someone to death .
that 's true .
the other argument is the death penalty is a deterrent
and do n't really agree with that
anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say
but if they 're going to kill
not to do it .
just do n't think it work that way ,
do n't think it is done
as a deterrent we run
say that people
thieves horse other hanging by the necks once every in
if it were really would think that it would be public and
do n't think it would be because nobody see it ever this private thing
to sit and watch and see a guy or .
do n't know if that would work that way or not really
there 's a lot of violence ,
did
what 's by the way your name ?
criminal courts ?
and that 's the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race .
the jury that are trying the officers in that case , is an all white panel .
in the local papers of that , fact
.
they have .
they have .
they moved up to it .
there are still quite a bit of publicity and obviously ,
that videotape was just horrible .
it was everywhere .
think that it would be very difficult to find it and known of what was going on a panel would not have seen and
with you
but ca n't imagine that they would do an white jury without having some sort of all , appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
on this issue
saying on the one hand he 's not getting a jury of his peers that is in some ways true
is also on the other hand , but
fact on
how interesting
within the community
the news media , what 's going to make of it
but what about the community ?
you talk to
to a whole lot of black people on it
beating the heck out of this guy
you 're going to have it just about anywhere .
but that is interesting .
what about the judge that is hearing the case ?
he is going to be a good adjudicator , ?
, do n't know
there is something else along those lines and again .
as much notoriety
and she had a dispute , black girl .
she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the owner of the store .
the criminal case up
gave the judge and
she gave her no time in jail all of these things
to get that judge .
you that kind of wish
life easier
it would .
the whole world would
a day care
all the different areas of
could n't handle that the children , got the treatment
and they would be one way when the parents were there , and when the parents left be another way .
they are expecting it not
do things , when you 're not around ,
, known
we kind of looked at is
kind of like what you were
it was a really good one ,
and in fact , it work .
my wife did for them artwork
so we got our care free days .
but they did n't have enough teachers
good set up
they have two teachers to every room .
and they have so when you walked in a good system , everything looks cool .
they did not show them care to
and and
every child in
, said , and no
what 's your problem .
think that is one thing that was important
they did ,
they really did well separate them .
it was just the teachers themselves .
their system ,
but their system was great
was n't just , but there
the one woman who did the babies
and she was
she loved them babies ,
and she cared for them
and would make me a nervous wreck ,
if then , but that does n't do any good .
they are
the group that we have other was kind of interesting .
was the one other we went to it
from other associations
but it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one ,
think she 'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff , and
with the kids and play with the kids
and it was
you do n't see that much .
so they have a really nice balance .
we liked that one .
is that
they did , but also
obedience was important .
a day care
your power back to control yourself
have never
that 's a new one , on me .
ca n't remember what they call it actually
but you just stand in them
and they have to stand there ,
it just as volatile as it is usually about
what do you think , mark ?
.
think there 's been some changes , definitely
definitely and will have its effect on the situation
with the same way arms
that just seemed to me to be a phenomenal demonstration of restraint ,
.
had fly through two enemies
.
that 's true .
they can ,
our feelings official
lots of things like that to happen
involved foreign policy than true interests
may have been .
is not saying that is not the case
wo n't probably
it does n't look like we 're getting ready to do much more in there .
even at
do you , think we ought to back off on our support of the country
what is our topic ?
taxes .
taxes .
we do pay too much ?
do we ?
what do you do ?
what you 're in kind of bracket
my tax bracket are pretty high up there .
the maximum tax bracket
and think we are paying too much
do n't have any children
a lot of property taxes and .
do n't use an awful lot of city services
have to work all the time to make just
about how you ?
do you pay too much ?
ca n't really complain
, is a student
is going to get back of what most
and , one of my parents are still claiming me .
into the working world
is sure
you look at your paycheck
you , which it did , and go all go .
have you
to school have
or did you go from high school into college directly ?
did working for some time
but did n't make enough money to make really , too much of a difference
worry about it
in politics concerning this
had committees or something like that ?
have n't
have n't done any of that type of work myself
towards the bank members there
all bank with
it went defunct recently
one of the congressmen written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks
for all those bad checks a loan
no interest ,
no schedule repayment
and it is
it 's really
too much
i look at my paycheck and
's see
me sales tax
me gasoline taxes
taxes .
all these others
and it 's just too expensive .
ca n't believe
you know
like you used student loans and things
have n't
my father pay for my tuition .
use of that
you studying down there
physics .
physics .
that sounds like a fun field .
that everybody says .
scientific .
heavy science
in the research particle or anything like that you
it or are more applied physics ?
got too much into my major yet
actually be physics
there is a different one for applied physics
more straight stuff than
maybe you can
i doubt about that
we pretty steep compared to most countries
actually do n't
do n't think so either
you working right now
.
what kind of work do you do ?
system design work and implementation work for the speech
you heard about this thing ?
through
me too
is a student co-op
i work and so to school about halftime
and do n't really have
, do n't know
just kind .
we really do n't have any vacation or sick days or health care or anything really
about what you ?
's stuff research here now
so they have
it is not quite as good as industry
but here is one of the significant benefits that you can take up to a semester two courses ,
and they pay for the classes .
they do that , if you 're research here
know of some of the people to have gotten then
think pay for the classes and stuff and
you work by kind of percentage
halftime if you work
if you want to do it , quickly .
they 'll let you , decrease just about your number of hours by any percentage
i thought of course with
so that probably will help out .
but , do you get any kind of health care stuff type ?
other things , other benefits than
.
we have to contribute to it a certain amount .
think that 's a pretty important part of it there because that can be expensive really if you 've ever any health problems
with my dad 's health plan where he work ,
be something to look into
that 's a whole topic to begin with other too
they have .
you but .
, that 's pretty important
because , is in school
student employees working do n't have to pay social security tax
though that right there are about , five percent
that 's a big won .
that 's the only about real bonus
'd have to pay an extra percent five or so if
you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying as well that
ever in case you need
we work pretty much from project to project with different sponsors
i working for an insurance company
juries , will decide the guilt or innocence
the awards up to more learned people but then .
that seems to make sense
each individual jury really do n't have any perception of what , if you will the going , award should be for a certain type of case within some kind of range .
like that you get out
they 're not going to sit there and to lose .
if , then they 're going to raise rates .
individually all down to us
need some people
setting for example
do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm , a dollar figure for losing body different parts ?
do n't know
know you can put a value on somebody 's limb that is always going to fit in all cases necessarily
you look at the age of the person and their station in life , how much longer
some kind of
that can be part of continuing education , maybe for judges and .
do n't know
that 's true .
if it is a company , you know they are insured .
think those should be uninsurable
think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself as did the damage
to the insurance paying the bills
for honest mistakes where they 've done something and something happens .
one of their employees cause damage or something .
they buy insurance for
do they get insured from other insurance companies
or how do that work ?
was talking just about any company
say a manufacturing company lumber
and somebody is on the premises
the wrong button
and he drops a load of lumber on somebody
insurance should pay for that .
put companies out of business by
not are talking about any loss
the person 's actual injuries
they awarding a second amount as to the company that is a lot less usually punishment
those could be paid for by insurance too
never really again , so .
the same thing old
is talking , not
about the thing that they know ,
is hurting people out there
and they continue to do it even after they became aware of that .
think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket then
a very narrow view of
and it was more like a funeral home .
and went to one
and it just have a very good director activities .
such a bad view of
send unless it was an absolute last resort
is
that sounds good .
heard
and that 's about all .
's she really and
of nursing that
one problem with
the , even out ,
they are not completely up on what should be going on or that 's not going on
and it can be pretty sad .
had a grandmother that have a stroke
a home for four or five years
was of her for herself after the stroke since she could not do very much care and
the best facility up which is not a practical solution since both my parents
you need essentially have full-time someone taking care of the person .
think it 's
it is sure .
really going to care for the older
tend very easily just
my grandfather passed away several years ago .
was much younger
the last several years of his life
every day and someone visited him .
my grandmother did .
but if she could n't every day , someone visited him .
a very small town home
and people did n't
they did n't care about what went on .
because they were just old people
it 's like a newborn baby .
nurses and get
being able to do things for themselves which they can no longer .
feel and
very hard for them to accept ,
a home but a transitional facility type
a retirement
more of a home retirement
he 's got his own apartment efficiency .
a meal one day and .
and other meals a day
but they do have activities group going on .
how he 's handling that ?
what was you saying ?
we started now
do you want to go ahead and start ?
really have n't been up to date on a lot of music
have been in school
have n't really gone out
you like classical music ?
classical music
rock and roll
and
all kinds
different things about each one of them
most of them except for country music
you do n't like country
might like dancing to it
but do n't like listening to it
you know
what 's the old music country like ?
make this stuff
is that
sometimes .
not all the time .
guess like the blues a lot
you could say it and
, too , and .
also like
me too
except heavy metal
and do n't like
are then
this heavy metal stuff on
and ca n't like that
groups like that
guns and roses , some of their stuff
some of these groups like but now .
have n't really
some of them rough really just
be surprised did n't you go to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff
used to a long time
but really now have n't done that much since
have been pretty busy
so
have n't
used
but do n't
.
at all
just have been real busy with lots of other things
old how
then went back .
went to school
worked and then
started back a year and a half ago and then
change
old how
then we are the same age
went to college because my parents did n't really have music in the house
put it that way .
they were
.
is always behind
is up to date on all that stuff never really
a certain kind of
my parents were
my mother have a piano in the house .
my father like western music country .
that 's what he grew up so listening to .
and he is
so he like that .
my mom and liked always that kind of stuff .
grew up listening to that stuff
kind of
do play the piano
do so
what songs does he play ?
he sings that .
, is not very good at remembering the titles
the titles and artists .
but can remember the song
do you get cable ?
but .
like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos
like watching that kind of thing
of her
she is not rock
have n't
and she is
do you happen to be working ?
that 's not large compared to some ,
but it is big enough .
they do n't and
they did
put all the money into it , but
they do n't add anything .
about what you ?
i work for a fairly large company
it 's got eight people thousand .
and we do have health insurance .
but we do have retirement .
they kind of up to match , you
percent up to six
and then the rest is in
that 's a pretty good deal .
it 's not bad .
now , how long it does take for your contribution to vest ?
do n't know
it 's probably a long time .
i work is the place at 's , health insurance kind of expensive .
a month or something for a family
can hold back money
what those use of plans , too , where they 'll pay for expenses type child care basically
can send a request for payment in
and they 'll send me a check for the amount they withheld .
that 's pretty good .
it saves off on taxes or something a third .
you work for
know the plan that everyone seems to be , in my place in one 's plan d
deductibles really high
really unlikely you 'd use that amount of money
so , someone did start a benefit cost analysis ,
and the best end up .
i guess ,
has a similar health plan on the other hand
one of my kids and was in a car accident
even your car insurance
a high on the health insurance
no fault here ,
a high on the car insurance
that is too bad .
, do n't know
think other than health insurance an extra week of time off would be nice
two weeks
two weeks
until you 've got four weeks and then they give you every year an extra days
that 's nice .
your seventh year of
that 's a long time .
companies do n't stay afloat that long ,
with the type of company telecommunications , you supposedly , used to be much more stable .
it 's a lot less stable than it used to be .
they used to have crap job security ,
n't but now
you work for bell or something like that
, do n't know
a lifelong job security
all that stuff
do n't think so
off people , which is another benefit that you can have other than for security salary 's trade off that
have , though
, do n't know
we have n't been doing layoffs .
of extra layers of management
for those people know
they get
some of it ,
mark , our situation is
she is actually at college bible for this current year .
in the way of a career , and then to have which colleges or universities
and then it comes down to the dollar .
for that jurisdiction a
come with a trade off of the costs
pretty much with
it 's really important for them to visit the college actually
is n't always the whole story
the catalogs
it does n't matter whether they 're selling school .
really is the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school and
just living in the community .
where dormitory life is right on campus as well
that quite a bit and change the character of it .
it tends to be a very conservative school
and there does n't seem to be the diversity of views a lot of universities will have .
we 're here ,
the on a small quantity of gas
our engineering students
and that 's the kind of thing that if you can see can also give you idea of the character of the school .
sort of
it is easy enough to crank out graduates ,
but really to challenge them
you to feed information
really do n't know of anyone who are looking for colleges now with the exception of people 's younger brothers and sisters
but
actually be type information
people need consider as well
what 's going to take university depending on the person programs to
program .
and and after that have to be able to support
if there 's just not much of a job market and
like a fine arts education ,
are not going to put food on your table
the recycling program is just terrible here .
it 's hard to find places to go .
do they do newspapers ?
, do n't know
do n't really
as a matter of fact is
newspapers and milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans like soup
they pick up .
they have all shopping carts and stuff
and and
and so we used to save them up just
and then they 'd come around
we 'd and give them to them .
during the winter time they move or something south
so do n't do anymore that
, known
known
they just overflow .
it up .
what is a guy to do .
just do n't know
just do n't know
you ca n't really unload all your stuff .
that 's true ,
had n't
that 's very inconvenient .
inconvenient , even
, known
known
's kind of bad about it
a pile of cans or bottles or something
do n't take ever anything but
you ought to , because the farmer 's market recycles absolutely everything .
but wait
have never seen before you
who
my name is bill .
too
just think everybody ought to do it
you do know ?
what about those grocery bags ?
and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
most also places
ask you
and they have little boxes that you can put in your old bags .
can bring in them .
those petroleum products going to kill
, known
known
it is really a small , hostile planet .
did you
really .
paper does n't
it is , though .
it comes from trees .
how it can be bad ?
with chemicals or something
trees break down
do n't get it
they do treat paper with chemicals
you can bury a piece of yellow paper ,
of weeks a
it will be whole .
you 'll be able to read off of it .
you told work
from now on just that
is going to switch to the white ones
white paper is too bad .
, too
is sure that 's fine
is sure
again in stone
think so ?
maybe .
tablets ?
the written word
think ?
, do n't know
what do you think ?
everybody has a computer .
kind of
we would no longer need paper at all .
that 's true .
would love that
good coverage from the sources that you have
actually
out on most of the current events .
off the news , if someone start to talk
do n't watch a lot of it ,
that is basically my only major source of information .
about what you ?
a bunch of different things
get every day
and try to have to look through that at least a few minutes
the short term news
do n't have enough time
especially much the channels news or anything like that
of it all about
is n't the news immediate what you 'd think , generally
but it 's
and it 's more in depth .
it 's more in depth , less broad .
actually , it is n't broad less , probably
but it 's just more in depth
and it 's just more significant information .
it is the big events , not the little events .
a big auto accident down
, known
trying just
or they 're making time
, known
, too
and then , there 's nothing that really is so exciting .
you may find little news item interesting one
so you have to wait twenty minutes to hear about it .
that 's about what it ends up being .
listen to the news to hear the report traffic or something
read as much as it
think that 's a good magazine , but
they are
at least in my mind
what kind of news and normally
what you do
that 's going to affect our economy quite a bit .
think it will ,
they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence ,
have yet to see it , but
though it 's real short term yet
, three months or something like that since that it 's been only
but they like to tell us that it 's going to be important .
think it is , too
think that 's a possibility ,
because it will be easier to do business over there , too , though ,
.
for the companies that have already a presence over there
so they have a holding toe ,
toe good holding
once you 're in there , then because you can easily expand .
their own reasons to have to be resolved yet
is sure within those people ' minds
can understand ,
they are starting off ,
their economy is a little bit weak ,
before they open up .
you do watch with sports or anything like that anything ?
actually is not really into sports
my roommates
bit of sports
against
we have to , fighting over the remote control .
you guys have at least a remote control .
it 's better to have not one of those sometimes .
do n't think anybody pay too little
would tend to agree very highly
are paying all a little bit taxes too much
do you get hit up for local taxes there ?
sure .
percent five sales tax
they tax it
that 's right
tax
which is pretty nice , probably
'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high but
there is no sales tax either ?
, there are very high property taxes
so they hit me up for the five percent there .
it is only a state tax here
we 've got a sales tax percent five .
paying state tax even if
but , at least on things like stock options and things like that , they do n't tax me .
that 's not too bad so .
worked in a factory last summer
and was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes on
really get a whole lot of return from that
do n't utilize any government welfare services
of course , i drive on the roads
went to the schools and stuff , and
feel really but
that 's not any fun .
of the year the
then , a percent surtax five ,
which is just outrageous
and if the government 's run these days , it seems just like a lot of it 's going to waste .
some things where you need infrastructure
things government do better ,
think government does a better space program than you 're going to get out of private individuals ,
that 's right ,
keep to those happy farmers .
a
is really fat
there is just too much bureaucracy way
look and then
do n't think we 're getting our money 's worth out of there
think it 's going into bureaucrats all
is a lot of it and
our taxes going to keep rising no matter what happens
and and then they say
congress , they are the fault for it .
but the other thing is that it is tricky , though ,
because that stuff off balance
their jobs
's taxes and not
that 's right .
so it 's very hard to say this is what we should cut .
that 's going to lower our national expenditures ,
but then you 're going to have people on welfare
and they are not putting in taxes .
n't
up with these policies
but , is what is very funny in our town meeting they were ,
want to pay for this , and this and this and this and this
then be course , the only problem with that nobody .
that 's right .
you have any pets ?
do
have a cat
have two dogs and
two dogs ,
what kind ?
it is
just got working at a pet shop done
is taking care of his dog and
he says , and my dog , do n't like cats
just .
so she do n't know yet this is a cat .
that 's good .
and they get along real good .
that was so interesting .
did n't expect that
that is cool ,
that 's nice .
see 's
what was the dog other you have ?
she 's sweet little real dog .
she 's got a very nice temperament .
everybody seems to be really happy with them .
they are good temperament .
they are a good temperament
with a lot
a good on their shoulders
dogs that other
are out there
but there are also some , not so smart ones .
the worse off they
down so much
the best pets
do n't really
it is
bull and dogs .
but do n't
pit bull
they are very friendly dogs actually .
are
've ever seen
they 're really nice .
of them quite a
collars and stuff on them
really friendly kind of medium intelligence
how they did get their reputation , then ?
them be that way , then
you ca n't really get a pit bull from birth is that way .
takes to get a dog really to respond
so are doing it in self protection
them it 's good , not going
like
was
they and n't
friendly really just
that is unusual .
was overwhelmed
was
right now ,
they picked up a lot of bad press lately .
they are
it be that way
the same room with
are used to running the house
and they should expect something like that to happen .
it did attack the child , then ?
bit him
that was not a good thing , and
because it was probably
the people who owned him should have been on the lookout for that .
and taken the precautions
they did n't .
it 's too bad it happened , though .
then is in trouble and not the person
to go ahead .
and how to determine child care
and that 's an interesting one for me to talk about since
a child care facility for
you should have , then some opinions on that .
do have some thoughts on that ,
a surrogate for a lot of people there
is also the child care facilities and
was going to choose my first safety consideration would be
my second consideration would
my personal third warm environment
the standards
but then after that there 's a lot more .
absolutely .
as a matter of fact believes with the children
was , that the right people , the qualified people and
the child 's safe
to take off four or five years
that would
get for young kids below the age of six
, of course , and then to make up for their longer years later that the parents would have to work in
in other words , they may probably not at all in the twenties working end up .
that would
is the world
you do n't have to be physically powerful to work
that is exactly right .
is to have a sharp mind ,
what kind of music
to lot of different forms of music ranging
in fact , it is easier for me say .
it is right on track the opera .
like
ca n't deal with opera at all but
's into some industrial music that are even harder than that , a bit
to it a
do n't mind music that is difficult to listen to ,
what kind of progressive stuff ?
's thirty ,
so much as the stream changed their musical style changed
it is , a lot of people saying in that position bands sold out .
pretty much bull
it is interesting .
they are producing similar music
and it 's good music
have but up on it
that 's good .
think it 's
is
for , popular music seemed
is about three minutes from my house
but he picked the right songs
that is all about he had going for him and for that matter .
i guess
is sure that sold for him a lot
that 's all you really need for .
a short hatred for
just it seems
it is interesting because you was saying that you liked classical music
a lot of classical music
some classical music
can believe that
what kind of things
is
stuff that
a lot of
that is interesting music , and
that 's right ,
do
and everyone will know it and hum
it 's safe .
and it is n't just chance taking enough for me .
was younger
we 'd go every weekend .
but we have n't done lately whole lot of it .
's kind of into it
so
was kind of into it for
for the most part
we do n't get do a whole lot of that up here .
that 's whereabouts ?
is that right ?
that 's pretty wild .
you got some lakes around that you can do so on .
and stuff
little bit
got just
that sounds good .
the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now .
it was heavy when we were there though .
did n't see , though any boats there
not too many ,
but
just got back from a weekend
and we have a , kind of a picnic in the type woods thing
it was pretty nice ,
did a lot of on stuff and sailing
that 's a lot of fun ,
my parents but too
they are kind of into it .
we have all up mostly bass boats here .
, is a pretty big thing
here on going up
is what major city
that 's and south or north of there or something ?
see me
that sounds pretty good .
that does stay pretty constant there
at night it got cold
that 's not too bad .
but
any done then
have n't done any lately ,
but that 's all ,
was in high school
that 's great .
we have a different boat and every day .
that 's fantastic .
'd go to work ,
do
it 's a lot of fun .
a pretty fast boat
one like that do have somebody teach you
pretty into it
were about six
it 's pretty easy ?
the physics behind it and how it works
it 's not so too bad ,
are pretty easy
have got into it ,
that 's about all we have .
lot of people do n't
may never again , but then
and that 's
they get so fast .
did n't know that
they get pretty quick ,
that would be something .
, have n't done that personally
lake all use
he goes on one of the great lakes
and there 's a lot of places you can go there .
so that 's a good thing .
but
so , what do you do for a job ?
primarily they electronic , then
it is
been here all my life
no doubt .
or do you think there is too much crime now ?
i guess , any crime is too much
but , it is out of control .
do n't know out of control
it could be worse
we 've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood .
there 's a lot of problems .
you know .
it 's got problems .
what 's really the answer
do n't want them out in circulation
but the problem is that we have only so much but room
we , and try to put aside in the warehouse
just other people come
is that
do n't have given up on the idea rehabilitation ?
a lot of people have
is not
and she was mostly dealing with people who were drug crimes on in
she taught in a prison
.
the problem and , she had was not with the inmates at all .
was the people who ran the prison
the bureaucracy
and will never hopefully ,
of a hallway the
there was no other classes going on at the time
, do n't know exactly what is that
so she did n't feel safe .
she did n't .
she did n't ,
for the first year when she had her first set of inmates ,
the administration , and kept getting worse then later on
of inmates that she did n't feel quite as comfortable around a
she did n't feel public schools , was safe
in a security maximum prison
it is at least maximum security .
that rehabilitation is possible
have given up on it
probably the most
a few people who worked in prisons and stuff to
is sure
always have problems
be some way , that 's a lot of this circumstances
funny labels
with little or no money would n't
think you can blame on social problems it
do n't know
there is not enough beds and programs , rising drug abuse treatment ,
and
it 's a mess .
what he wants to do is to take all the money that gets for drug enforcement and use he
the problem at the demand and .
attack supply that make sense to some extent
use as long as they stayed in the parking drugs
see 's
can start
we now because our family 's growing find one
are
is looking at something larger than what we have so
are looking for something bigger , so
both kind of small
and we 're looking at some just four door , five sedans passenger as well .
you open to buying foreign cars
really do n't have a preference either way ,
have n't any substantial real problems with
really a lot it and .
did , but also that when
does n't quite
take once every back in
it 's clearly just a problem design there .
it is .
right now ,
is going to be sort of a sports car
would like to have a sports car really
, do n't have a family
but do n't like it enough to buy
something along that lines but
interesting .
have an economy
'd like to move on to something a little better
that is interesting .
i look for size and safety and then mileage
probably ,
were looking for mileage ,
depends initially , but
that 's right .
actually it was my wife 's car she brought into the marriage
we have to replace the plate friction and the transmission at thirty thousand miles ,
and they were okay .
has never a problem with it , and
but my mother have
had and
definitely would be looking for a foreign car
that is interesting .
which is a good deal .
all the depreciation been taken off
and okay , the dealer , come out
what they take kind of hit
but sounds like everybody 's have their chance to make
, but do n't know
is sure they did
a little bit more than
but it is interesting ,
, but do n't know
like at
and how do you feel about them ?
pretty good , actually
and they have a pretty good package benefits .
in fact , they are kind of known .
is n't the pay
saw a survey recently
which kind of
that 's good .
what kind of a degree have you got ?
or any of that stuff
our benefits pretty good
the contribution 's company , kind of a pain
how long have you been with them ?
have been with them for seven years
that 's good .
and , is the best thing years four or five years you are completely vested in the retirement plan , and everything ,
several medical plans to choose from
, do n't get that often sick
do n't pay much of it , so
and pay every time
they do n't cover though eyes ,
have contact lenses , and
that is so kind of a pain .
, but can live
almost a hundred percent but for all practical purpose .
that sounds like you must feel really good about it .
and the dental plan is
that 's the case , but not
so , .
it is
about what you ?
a job part time at
they pay better than my sort of per hour
they are not the greatest .
is a computer scientist
was at that time in gravy city and
and benefits was just amazing
and we have
with the government , it 's nice that quite a deal and not
but it 's
we have to pay about twenty percent of our costs
to from kind of mediocre to really sweet
a relatively good planning at
but it could be better ,
that 's for sure ,
are , but when
about academics or anything like that
and so are
one of the things with my company 's they 've got a reputation for a lot of job security
around quite a bit within the company
had move my residence to do that
is that
that is interesting ,
his complex over there
and it 's amazing .
it is
and , he really seems really happy , with the set up .
a few years ago he moved back to take that position east and his family
of
of crime in your area
c around here
it 's really bad here .
they come to school , of all things
it seems to be on the heels of poverty conditions that warfare gang very rapidly follows .
is that
most of them centered around drug territory .
and they are so protecting their economic interests , i guess .
about to read in the paper here that they 're doing as far as crimes
that 's efficient .
that is the latest thing .
there is no damage to the car or anything that way .
they just wait for you to show up after .
to drive to your house
you get out
they get , and in
go with your car .
it car
phrase that
that 's kind of the latest thing ,
c the area it gets worse as far as the number of homicides progressively ,
we bring our kids , because we 're not from around here , up in this area
we came from twenty years in the military which
this is a whole thing , have for us to put up with new so
and it 's really scary sometimes .
that many , places
it 's pretty bad when they are using detectors in school metal and
it is a way of life for everybody .
would hate to have to wrestle with that problem
do n't know what the solution is
there 's no way they can stop the drugs ,
and that 's what is causing all the killing .
there is
most of them in terms of what you 'd have to do fairly radical
these kids turn toward the drugs and everything else
because making a living at anything .
with that as their way of life
understand that what they were they 're doing is actually illegal because this is the way raised
it is illegal ,
but it 's
so it 's maybe the law in their eyes
been changed instead of their way of life
, so do n't know
glad because it 's not easy to
in terms of an actual solution to the problem
the social other problems would n't go away .
they always have been with us .
was this whole argument
thought , but then
have you ever on a jury served ?
have not
been
and you ?
was
and then was chosen not
primarily because
they view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict
do n't
picked up in a class psychology some time ago
and they kind of liked me .
do n't know what they saw in me ,
but they saw it .
back to the issue , but
, do n't know
might be acceptable , particularly in civil cases , too , but
a rule majority by jury would
me an example of
think there ought to be a unanimous vote because by law and by constitution there must be proved beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that in question the person did this
a majority rule would be more in line as there is no smoking real gun in the civil cases .
is making any sense or not
criminal cases
there are often
if there were majority rule it would
say ca n't really be known
, both up in a civil and criminal case
the documentary , the thin blue line demonstrated that pretty much .
do n't
is not
when he was much younger a
was
was and
many cases in
many laws , but little justice
just , is not always
certainly not ,
certainly .
in all this
you get up
a few questions and they
both sides
as much as they like
or think it is now a limit ,
now they have a limit , probably
but pretty much going
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you ca n't serve .
for me , it was financial hardship ,
onto the thing , but
was never aware that juries have any say on recommending sentencing
has the final say ,
what kind of experience do you have , then with child care ?
i wonder if that worked .
it does say something ?
think it usually do
, do n't know
a little longer ,
do n't remember
it seemed like it did ,
but it might not .
we can start
do n't have any kids
she had just a baby ,
he is about five months old
you do have kids ?
have three
.
do n't work , though ,
have children two
anybody 's in that situation to find
do but live in a big community ?
it 's a fairly large community .
got , though she
he has a boss -lrb- moved into a larger office
and she is able to take her baby to work .
and it is a small office that she works in
it 's a legal office , and
and it 's just one lawyer
the only one and that take care of the office
there is no one else : work there .
they have an extra room and for the baby everything , and so
so it works out for her pretty good .
lucky how
have sometimes mothers or grandmothers : take care of their kids
, is not a large real one
so it 's safe fairly .
and to get references
that they 're not going to get enough attention ?
and they 're expensive
's academic them things and
and just or they let them play and things like that ,
a long time find the right place
and you do n't even know if it 's going to be the right place or not always .
anything could happen .
i guess after he gets to a certain age she is going to have to take to a day care
when she ca n't keep control of him
he and starts
it would be hard ,
kind of
it would
the phone or at the wrong time
think she had problems with that , too
when you have kids , you will work ?
you do work now ?
do n't know
is that
be able to watch them and all the time to be there for them
is
my kids at home
here is so all the time
so they do n't go to school .
what is that , called
it is correspondence school ,
at home .
that is interesting .
do you have to have ?
depends
some laws
you be a certified teacher in order to do that
does n't yet , say
and is not a certified teacher
went to college ,
my kids but right now
so they have n't been to public schools at all .
was one of them
he was , and so , my oldest
and then never have been
is that they have three judges , basically
and you get up there
present and his evidence
your defense attorney present and their evidence
go off , figure it out , and then come back and say whether you 're guilty or not
our judicial system is in total such chaos .
think what they need to do is they need somehow take the money out of it
we have a family called all day family .
they were all murdered .
all the people , signed confessions
they went to a trial by jury .
do with justice
it is one of those things ,
would have to look at it
sitting in that kind of stuff days after days , they know ,
what is good and what is n't ,
they 'd be able to say
you ca n't use this because it was as evidence
and then says the judge ,
disregard that
come on ,
any jury is not going to disregard the evidence .
that 's true .
think our judicial system 's attorney welfare myself
that may be very well .
in the utmost contempt .
my favorite , is the police department
is not
the judicial system is aimed at the citizens
have work schedules ,
call at work
we have social security numbers ,
they can trace down us ,
we have telephones ,
then we have checkbooks .
criminals have none of these things .
they are real difficult to catch ,
get any monetary gain out of it
you do
that 's true .
their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals
how would you go about changing it ?
the problem down
the details left up to somebody else .
yet going out on the streets
is they and
what might cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that very well
take him , two minutes
he still charges you that hundred dollars .
whether it 's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else you get
and is that it .
firmly in that
none of this
the most renowned defense attorney
could never afford
that 's true .
who are paying for that ?
you 're talking to part of them who are paying for that .
the other half that are paying for it to
that 's right .
it 's amazing
look at it the judges , they are all former lawyers and when .
that is another problem .
you get the lawyers out of it
they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever ,
start
do n't really know that much about the recycling in this area that we 're in
the school does n't have any kind of programs or anything out here .
the city bought the big green trash cans
and they have a recycling truck that comes around now
you separate and
and set out
they pick up and
it works and
they be having a real good response
that 's pretty good .
originally we 're
and know they did that similar type thing in
separate trash cans
you separate and
it in there
and they took it .
for cans give you so many cents back
really do n't know
, do n't really know
they started after we moved here down
and so are not really familiar
but do n't
or , do you get money for it ?
noticed it
you do n't see so too many thrown out around the streets .
all kinds of
the old days as
so , is that maybe one thing that they can do .
now they are a lot more expensive than that
they were at least ten apiece cents
was how much were those bottles ?
and , they come in eight and packs ten instead of six packs
it was two dollars and something for the bottles and .
that was my brother 's first job in a grocery store .
he was in the area bottle .
pretty dangerous out there when
they say there is a big glut of the green glass ,
of green glass .
it 's amazing .
really out in this area , they do n't have anything .
do know some of these places , but
them and because people were coming and dumping their trash in them .
have , the milk jugs
to separate the stuff
more than it is worth .
, do n't know
selecting as clean junk
who want to clean their junk before
that 's right ,
that 's right .
all .
it was nice talking .
it was nice talking .
have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything
think that 's two or three minutes fine
is
it was nice talking
some money and guess was going to do so that he could make it for my son .
but then it had my name on it ,
is so
'll sit down here , and called it
we are doing it for a church choir
are
that is interesting .
that 's nice .
thank you .
thank you .
the company you do
they just recently started a policy of testing drugs , which was kind of interesting ,
because they did n't do that , when
but they have started a drug testing policy , not because of their own convictions since then
about how you ?
for drugs at all
use of on company premises narcotics , says it .
that 's pretty general , so
i work for
is an engineering there , and
do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites , but
but do n't operate any machinery
our company do operate machinery like drilling rigs and things like that
because they are at a higher risk of exposure
and is part of that
test for drugs in that capacity
turns up in
dangerous equipment and things like that do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field and
what 's the nature of your company 's business ?
oil well services
oil companies , big oil companies
go out to the client 's oil well and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff
is the thing that is interesting
work in the house software , and
all software engineers and .
never going out to the oil rigs or anything
a little different , actually --
but we have to go through the same thing ,
it 's a little different , than a lot of drug policies .
in our case , it 's
give you a test drug if they and then right away
or anything like that
but , a lot of people were upset with the policy really at first .
parties and stuff
they did n't find , and
the drug regular random or even
in fact , they 'll have little these parties ,
my brother lives
him come get me
and do n't know ,
think it 's got some relevance ,
its relevance is
in your case do n't
immediately after an on the job accident about
it 's really bizarre .
where
she was a personnel secretary and
and she had
and do n't know
is ambivalent about the whole thing
they should be able to make it of employment in some sense to continue as a
had to do a test drug
and it was kind of a long story ,
just an humiliating experience
and it amounted to going in any of these interviews before ,
, is not even working
is going for interviews in
took to the doctor me they
was it
they told me and actually beforehand
, but have forgotten about that
, and was n't able to give a full sample , when
is the procedure and
in there with the doctor
he makes you take off all your clothes
you and then .
or what do you think ?
that 's a really hard question .
do know that politicians talking out of both sides of their mouths always
our friend , the president , right now , says no new taxes
we should be cutting now because of the recession taxes
at the same time , and the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases ,
the politicians straightforward
it 's hard to call .
it 's really .
really never thought the question have really do
always
that 's tax
we are paying money
supposedly this money and are going into some kind of fund so when it comes our turn to retire , the money will be there for us
--
of my paycheck or other every week
and is nothing as far
and we 're not going to get the exact same number of dollars back even .
may be wrong ,
supposedly but is it with people , it really tough once
and they have n't yet just .
that might be the difference .
do n't know
historical sites with the full federal money , and everything almost as political favors to very strong politicians appear
or to reject the whole thing
it sounds like you think we 'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto .
the president uses it to get rid of this kind of waste
lots of confidence in your president to veto important things not
whenever there is that kind of subjective judgment , and there 's always
that solve our problems
i
there is a political term for this stuff , pork barrel or something .
pork barrel politics
pork barrel politics
there be some way to do it
least at
, do n't know
they were very good at first ,
and that 's because things went so well part of the reason is a nominee he became
course and out of fell , then .
it 's tough .
there are two ways you can kind of going to get out of financial tough situations .
the economy
it 's a hard balance .
it is definitely .
even not for government ,
even just for a small business
what is hot with me down here ,
do n't ever listen to the radio
and that 's what is hot around here usually
what kind of music do you like ?
mostly folk music
folk music
we 're on totally different wavelengths .
what about classic rock type stations
do n't listen to the radio at all
living in a fairly small town
-- at least to me , only the type of music sounds good at a high volumes
do n't like listening at high volumes and
some of their stuff older but was quite enjoyable .
is really good that does n't something even sound
.
anything you like now , other than folk music coming out new
do n't know any music folk at all
is sure that there 's a lot of that down there
plenty .
can stand down here
pretty big everywhere , as
some of them , the artists hitting the pop charts even
it is kind of strange that it is getting as big as it is .
it 's quite odd ,
, but do n't know
think that 's music kind of going an odd direction
it 's not necessarily becoming good music , popular just music .
most artists in to make
is that
music and then be wrapped around now .
now , it is around the other way .
at least to my mind , guns and roses does n't have much too to say .
they do n't
but it 's kind of odd ,
it does n't have to be good ,
it 's just who do it .
somebody else was
because she did it , but it is supposed to be good ,
it is more than anything
things now working
it is the artist , not the merit .
do n't think that 's a good thing at all ,
we have reached
, do n't know
do n't know which artist , is which for the most part
to a song
either like the song
or do n't like it
eventually if the song and then 'll figure out what it was
is on popular music
is on the radio
you have to figure out what to buy ,
or do you just buy along the same artist ?
mostly just buy all the time along the same lines .
do n't really very often switch to new things around
way to
you do n't like an album ,
stop then ?
generally ,
only about the new music
and that way
do n't go out on a limb and buy
that 's i one thing like about some of the music folk scenes ,
there are up in new jersey
and , it 's very nice ,
into the house coffee
an artist and are there
and very often the artist will have an album
, and you buy if you like so the album .
you get definitely so
you do n't always quite get it right ,
it is
what kind of crime problem do you usually run into ?
any specifics ?
from very few actual robberies of residences reported
over a small store or a car things theft of that nature
very few assaults ,
, nothing really too big
i guess here
some , but not very high
as far as tellers and things like that , it 's not either extremely high .
taking women from the teller , making them give him , raping them all money and stuff and then at the same time , and
that is so kind of like a double assault there .
a strange case what happened about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine .
it was a free standing machine
and put it on the back and drove away with it
there is a crime for you .
there is a crime .
, because they were doing arrests and things like that drug ,
said from what is reported in the news
, do n't know
and a lot of it is due to drugs .
it 's not like it
it is for drugs because you ca n't really on the street
even though it do exist take not
living in an apartment .
and the apartment would be very easy for just about anyone to break in .
even so , but , it is still difficult
someone , are motivated to come in just
it could still then happen .
that 's true ,
you , people much , but .
there was one case ,
was
so happened this person , worked at the same place
work and at
but did n't know they have been watching me
was getting ready to go one morning in my car
you do n't have to be at eight to work ,
shock ,
are buying a car
ca n't do it right now
our situation is that we 're a family two car
it 's got a loan five year ,
still got a couple years to run
what kind of a car
something .
about how you ?
think so the door four is a major requirement probably
than that reasonable cost and safety and economy as much
is not looking for one with a big great engine
something that will carry it around careful 's best way to describe it .
and that seems to be just fine .
think and that probably is a little for this day and age kill over
they are
and it is
it 's not
basically for transportation
had move some members of the family or do this
have and have not to borrow one
not really ,
it 's a truck two wheel drive
i figure if
of looking at it
and went into another car ,
a drive rear wheel
snow tires after that
have n't any problems since
.
for carrying around our kids and others
and flip around them
some real creative load
what they and a child 's five years have old
and it 's really handy for hauling around him and their stuff ,
so certainly , we 'd have to consider a van just seriously for their functional value .
high school
what about all wheel drive ?
that is something that you 'd be interested in
's with the small tires it is done pretty well in winter , and
like you do n't want to be anyway driving probably again if
'd be happy with a reasonable door four
in our society the most
from each robberies probably
is what happens up a lot there ?
and things getting stolen
far as money and stuff insurance
everybody pay for it eventually
because drug use is a more prevalent crime , though ,
it 's a crime ,
that 's a crime .
is a crime
that 's true .
that i break
misdemeanors and drug use
drug use , probably actually is a misdemeanor
been , such as , or anything
that was a crime
, got a year ' probation for that
that 's not that much .
it was n't a deal that big .
of think i other people
think rape is one of the worst crimes
think it 's
in some ways , it is almost worse than murder .
it is
.
it 's a rather final solution , though .
live with the rest of their life that
think is an appropriate punishment for things such as rape
it 's a pretty good thing .
with that
the electric chair
do they ?
think that is still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy
guess and usually they 're always sure they got the right guy ,
think the appeal process take too long
do so
from conviction execution should take no longer than to a year .
if
a year 's plenty of time for something to come out
then there 's been guys in jail for six years
and the other guy admits he did it
the system is n't perfect ,
it is run by a bunch of imperfect humans .
the best to make it perfect you can ,
try real hard
you have to accept some of the errors
think murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment for murderers
do n't know if it or not , though , would
do n't think it 's so much of a deterrent as it is a good way for vengeance for the relatives and family members ,
you know
and probably , too
just general to society ,
it kind of gets it off their chest .
it does
lot of
and they are the , kind of of passion and stuff like that crimes .
do n't think you 'll stop all that stuff dead ever ,
you might be able to stop people ,
they are thinking about it ,
they 're going to get the chair if they get caught
they can be ,
but usually n't
of the moment
that 's right .
they could probably do it again .
they would have no problems doing it again .
that 's right ,
they did n't have any time the first time doing it .
looks like we 're ready to go .
capital punishment
be a deterrent to crime
but do n't think it really actually do that
most of the time crimes
might get the gas chamber or something like that
worry afterwards
and they get out of it
and about how you ?
too
think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not .
you still have to do it .
of an extreme case like a serial murderer
you are so , then in favor of capital punishment .
for some things
or to
you ca n't guarantee that they would n't escape from prison and do it again .
then all over again
and do n't think that rehabilitation is effective
, have to agree with you
and is also kind of in favor of capital punishment
just do n't think it acts because you see them still committing the same crimes , much as a deterrent to these people
agree with you that we should have it
do n't know it 's always effective ,
kind of
it 's a difficult problem to determine how you 're going to punish somebody for a particular crime ,
their husbands abused them
and really , that would warrant capital punishment .
do you think they should be punished at all or go to prison ,
because they 're not really a danger to society .
it was almost really in a case like that self defense .
it is to a certain extent
sometimes they put them in jail
the circumstances , and the extent of the abuse and .
wonder about this
unfortunately , and we do n't get to do it ,
if , for example , somebody did something to your family , you have the right to administer the punishment then be a long time ago
if so , if you have the right to execute that person , .
if somebody have done something to my family would
but do n't think that 's done much anywhere
that 's kind of drastic punishment .
think that would be kind of drastic punishment
might make you feel better
should chance that if there 's a chance for rehabilitation then
then i no matter people think what they should
because they are a danger to everybody else .
that is interesting .
have to agree with that
really a danger to society
a lot of people that and .
probably more of them then the other way around .
interesting .
not sure
what we 've kind of capital punishment
it sounds like you 've got a television going on there ,
most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio
what station do you listen to ?
it 's a local radio station .
it 's called i f l , cliff k .
cliff ,
,
, it is it
it 's not a network station .
public radio a lot to
now a little
this station has a lot of just ongoing news
pretty much from covering to cover
how do you like it ?
went out of business here
that must be pretty bad .
how that did happen , anyway ?
financial trouble
not
when it did happen ?
they closed down about three months ago
how do you keep up ?
quite a task if
they are
they are thick .
if , it is in the times and in detail .
we used to have two papers here in town
about two years ago , because of just nobody
really so there is a major l now only one
much .
and they are not bad as far as a local paper goes .
we talk about newspapers and stuff
and it 's a pretty good paper ,
but it is not the times .
occasionally to pick up and time magazine , or something if they 've got an interesting lead story ,
do n't have time
time magazine a lot
but do n't read it much anymore
that 's kind of a problem for them .
a lot of
.
the big dailies do n't
is the times
they do n't
but it still is not an awful lot of news .
known
it was a big discovery when the times found out there was a place called orange county .
the way they 've been handling before it , they practically acted like their reporters who needed to shots to go south of the l a county border .
they and of course cover the county
they ignore places outside of the county
of arrogant , though
you are taking our money , but you 're not
my news driving home from
that is one of my big sources for current events information .
that coverage
that 's my wife on the other hand home most of the day
she and watch a lot of the cable news network .
you ever had
the public national radio
you do
it or not be happening in your backyard
so it 's not as , personal ,
they take when almost all emotions out of it
they give more of just the facts than opinions
very much so ,
very much so ,
think it 's important to interpret it ,
a lot of the times person but do n't have .
find to be more useful
the straight
be able to form of it my own opinion
hear someone 's interpretation of it
a lot of
think so overall
saying milk factory baby
was being severely censored and could not make he
but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that , this is n't a milk baby factory ,
how he could say
think people have that opinion
first going .
have two kids ,
have one seven and one five
and are happy with it
are happy with the school ,
it is great ,
good teachers
good curriculum
a lot
they have no problems ,
do live in the best part of the city , though , but
, is not
but , everybody around me is
it part of town
kind of rundown and older
offer as much as the school that
really do n't think that 's fair
, but are happy with what they are in
to go ahead .
was going to say
a lot of my friends and was in one of the neighboring suburbs
but the difference in schools was pretty substantial
and if the entire county had just one school system is one of the things that probably would have been better
that could result in more equitable distribution of money and
was out to the suburbs
and the city had
so they did n't have a lot of
was a result , the schools
the nice supplies in
was a senior that some other schools have
would be to expand the size of school districts , almost
with the rich people then the problem is that will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they 'll move to get better schools farther away
its own tail sort
and you 've got room in every room mothers ,
you 've got art mothers ,
you 've got every holiday ,
there are parties .
all these kids have these really supportive parents up there for something .
what their kid 's teacher 's name , is
that have a whole lot to do with it ,
n't willing to go with the kids and find out
is
is
why
n't just
is up at my kids ' school there ,
what they are learning
, and i call find out
having problems
she does need help with anything
's she
the kids and not motivated
they have no motivation from home ,
just so go
'll get through the day and bring homework home and
and say you 're going to do this
they just take a notion to do it ,
,
that does n't work either , and
they have to have guidance
and they ca n't just
and there 's nothing .
know that was a big factor for me
up coming out of the public school system very well
and , was very good education
think the difference for me was always they were there , and
of course you 're going to study and do well
you be so returning products
not really too bad .
got anyway , but it
and they were real good about taking it back .
it was n't a problem at all ,
was able to get pretty easily back that so
, but do n't know
have n't really
have you ?
had to
is pushing myself it almost
should have known better ,
pretty good stuff
was reading in consumer tonight reports about that as a matter of fact something
going to do you
but that 's the way it is .
, do n't know
manufacturers and should get a clue
and they should start making quality products .
too saw the consumer reports until
all the cars
essentially and do n't see much of a trend
there is nothing wrong with them .
and they 're pieces of junk .
known
at it still ,
, but do n't know
maybe they are getting better ,
maybe they are starting to get a clue .
they got a year three leading time .
that 's just it .
technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until quite a few years down the road
is the computer industry .
because technology is so volatile and changing all the time .
or you paid five bucks hundred for this program ,
so send twenty us
a really great
up pretty quickly
and that 's a real good thing , i guess .
do n't know
all the chips that make up the hardware
right now they 're kind of the leaders .
all those commercials for windows
.
they 'd sell more if they were honest .
too because almost is the key word , there
and do n't really see an advantage of windows at all
that 's true , too .
, but do n't know
a little bit out of the personal computer business
but do n't really do much with it at home
if you bought straight off a book power , a lot of them have to go back .
or other possibly problems with floppy drive
you sound like you must work in the computer business .
have one ,
at work
have a machine at home and
to the user 's group
is in the industry , but not actually
do n't work
that 's all right .
that 's true .
want to buy something ,
a personal computer
what kind of
had a tune done up
had the brakes on it done and
do n't have a scope
and it 's hard to get at them
the time on them
just do n't have any more time
have to change the battery
do have the background
what need to be done
know the oil should be very regularly changed and
stay and so on
wanted
or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it
just to pack the bearings ?
to pack the bearings
let them do some times
that 's free ,
it and then can
but it was still in the long run cheaper
just got the brakes done so
and thought that was a good deal
had considerable experience
took auto shop in high school , and
been back
, but still have a pretty good feeling for it
had bigger cars
out and fairly rapidly on those
, have almost one hundred and ten
and there was hardly any wear to them .
they do n't
just so did it anyway
like to stay on it up
just kind of up on it
pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil , the oil is about
it is
you had some good experiences with that
and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that .
the maintenance of my car
was
these pressing aluminum things
probably the water pump decided to go out and about four months ago .
were on my way to work day one
and the other half was
do you all have a budget ?
.
we have three teenage daughters and
and they are very expensive .
so we have somewhat of a system .
it is kind of hard to explain .
we 've actually gone , recently just to having two checking accounts .
we have always just one .
we having two
it is kind of hard to talk about this because to me it 's very personal .
kind of
handle my wife
of course , and we 're like a lot of people .
just scramble through month to month .
do you have a family income two or one income ?
we have a family income two .
she also work
but she enjoy it
and she is good at it .
is
you know how that goes ,
she handles it pretty well .
she writes the checks all once a month .
her career is
she is an annuity administrator
and so she works for an insurance company .
but she enjoy it .
she keeping track of all stuff that
her a little bit field to
sort of .
, budgets from time to time with
you have to keep up with them .
so a lot of
our savings kind
never so .
directly just taken
it 's just taking it out .
the same thing
and is that kind of handy .
if , because you do n't miss it .
you do n't spend it .
to take out something
that is exactly what we 've always done
what they have always have
if you save so much , then they sometimes will match it .
we 've done that too .
but , my husband work for an insurance company
for about ten years he and now .
but he was with another company before that ,
work , also
have a job part time , but only
got and
we just transfer it into my account
then i that use for
add to that my own check
some of the clothes the girls need and things like that
all pretty much
by ear , but just kind of playing .
and he breaks down all it
are given a month so much money ,
kind of get the food out of that to
do n't ask for more
make it on that
to the grocery store
you can really and waste a lot of money that way .
have long
about five years
you are so .
so do you have a family too ?
have got little girl one
not really .
not too bad
not like she will later on .
of activities to do all these choices
really have you and then ,
what we can do here
and then you have to sit down and plan some more really
but , we did n't have much of a budget
think as the girls got older and then we did more and more of that
more budgeting as they got older .
but what do you do ?
is an electronic technician
is to talk about those things
better 'd get back
but .
find a lot
to work out of book check one
was spending in one month
is spending
and it 's so much easier ,
do n't know a lot about them
that 's great .
is thinking about we
great customer satisfaction from
a lot of people like them
like what ?
's see
with human beings in mind
and that 's not just the driver and the passenger
but that 's the person who is working ,
almost all my own maintenance and those types of things
almost at
most of the work on that myself and .
and will do with the modern cars that never when
it 's not worth my time .
you ca n't get in there .
you ca n't do anything .
and it is
i look at it
and say , boy ,
'd have to go almost take a class or something like that
it 's really very easy to work on
and is
it cause too and was .
kind of
too much to get even the oil and .
and that is probably
'd look at
that is one of the things that .
that 's a real nice car
it 's a really nice car .
i think , it 's a both stylish car inside and out .
it is comfortable to drive .
reasonable performance
been
did n't realize they were putting now in that car dual air bags and
that , that 's
but the thing is that it is twenty thousand dollars .
buying a new car in the next year and a half or so
so we 're actually been looking around and thinking about things .
do n't know
what do you call it ?
that would be a good deal to go with .
because they looked nice really .
for looking in those
what kind of things but ?
do n't think you can get dual side air bags
the most important thing is a car that 's not going to fall apart
down set
you look at consumer reports .
consumer reports over
of a four door and then .
what 's your community currently doing with regard to recycling ?
in that respect
but living in a metropolitan area
and they are not inclined to do something aggressive as that as too .
an apartment complex
a lot of the issues with regard to recycling
a bottle bill was passed
we have a bottle bill for now quite a few years
and are not going to throw away a bottle ,
it is
of thing
they push through a bill
but people need be more conscious .
a lot of people and .
and it 's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell sodas and stuff .
on a refund and on plastic bottles and everything
here as far as recycling bottles and cans up
and for it to go through think it took three tries
and it 's been pretty successful
people would have a drink of soda ,
instead of throwing out the window ,
been as far as
and that 's the big thing that they try to promote .
lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate .
that 's a good idea .
there be a factor motivation
i work for a defense contractor
so , it 's incentives like that : get more conscious people .
believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books
from projects to collect old ones
with the trash out
a large volume of annual trash and .
the local schools , you could send your book phone with your kid to school
thing to do n't break down over a long period of time
the glue and stuff
they come up with some way of pulling the glue out
's see
how about about ten years ago ,
what you do
think families were more together
they did more things together .
they ate together dinner at the table .
now with the children to come and just to spend the day
change since ten years ago
what do you think about that ?
ten years from today seem rather short actually .
society generally have
and do n't know ,
it for family and things like that leave out a lot of time .
think that has a lot to do with economic situation , but
about what as far as
, they did ten twenty years ago
.
think people were too busy twenty ten years ago
old how
maybe so there is a gap between us five year .
think things have been busy all along
used to be just one person working
most places for both parents to work
do you think it 's an economic necessity
or do you think we 're , all
think that is part of it , too ,
do you think , people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs
n't
do n't think that
really a lot of people to do n't have but then but .
other group that are working to maintain
the two cars , and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
you 're saying
of living the higher
the money and who think that , in my opinion , the case is
of living and those who really need the job the
we 're sticking to social changes more
people but
not all of those and .
it become a necessity
through the school system
talk on this thing
really much of a problem with the school system
we do n't have anything
it seems to be difficult for students not enough .
do n't know
have and
listening to the world
so it 's hard
you know
down here
the dropout rates from the schools
certainly how much i pay in real estate taxes and .
is really getting my money 's worth
so many different bad reports coming out of the school system
are out there
we employ people
the schools have such a high dropout rate in the big cities but
understand that either
the kind of
in those areas where there are also poverty and crime
they all and go together
if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle , when you have the dropout rate and poverty crime and general kind of conditions that things ought to get better
are all three social issues
but , it 's just like .
a complicated issue
would blame it directly on the school
on the school
of different things a
on the school system
that 's .
quite well for themselves .
the teachers in
not all school districts
some school districts out there
they are both teachers ,
they work in the afternoons
they work both full-time .
that family is making a grand hundred over .
agree teaching our kids is important
nine months a year
an awful lot of breaks in between
is spending on that
and do n't even have kids
that 's true .
you can always play games with talking about , look .
my tax dollars paying for this
this is wrong .
and there is much you can do about that directly not really .
you have other professional jobs
and this is a profession .
you into the cowboys
, is not
, have n't been
is not a cowboys ' man , but still
that 's all right .
that 's my favorite team ,
they did n't do too bad last season .
but , they can
about how
do n't know
depending on who is hot and who is not really back and forth of
a fair weather fan in
i kind of like .
that is another one of my favorites .
they are not totally my favorite .
but like them .
watch a little bit college
i kind of like college actually .
quite a bit
that 's kind of strange .
it 's too much for me in college football running .
the pros
it is ?
that could be .
do it , .
college football is a little bit different
you probably would n't like then my favorite team in college .
who 's that ?
there is a running team .
is that
'll take any days
definitely see how
too much running get pretty boring as well
it 's four yards , three eight yards yards .
think they are starting to realize that
think they are starting to realize they just ca n't compete anymore
it 's high dollar .
now it 's all money .
this world league is coming in ?
that is getting ready to start up ?
very much that
not really .
think it 's an institution
it 's like major baseball league if we tried to start something to take over .
it can take over part of it .
it can take over a small market share
it 's going to take a little bit .
some people going to watch it
is never
think
see their claim of world football
it is kind of strange .
we are the only ones , who take it far that
of like soccer
play it never really
the idea but .
it 's an interesting game to watch .
you want to call it there .
that 's some brutal stuff there .
worse than football , as far as
out there .
.
that 's just wild .
that 's why it 's a big thing college .
so
could see the feeling for that
but it is fun to play .
'll give it that
play then it
i doubt it .
this country
you ca n't stay healthy and do that .
that 's a rough game .
it is .
but do n't know
really .
it is kind of odd .
you do know where is that ?
n't
it is a small town .
to tell you 're not even really
just now live there .
but do n't know
, but do n't know
me put my on the , credit card bill telephone number
is not
and in fact , it 's
but it does n't stop many people from doing it .
and it is one of the things that it is used for , primarily
have always done that
then that is not really necessary or legal once
going to do
going to say you do n't want to sell me this product then that 's fine .
'll buy it somewhere else or buy at all , not just
ultimately , and then , they say , no
you do n't have to put it down .
but it 's really part of this thing compliance .
know certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles
because that really burns me .
you have to do that .
your name or information to anyone
it because someone asks and .
you can always
but it 's
and and then take that information and sell it to somebody ,
do n't think they have the right to do that
with you there .
that is something that people have seen .
here is an easy way to make .
in the courts or not
heard , fairly recently
the budget problems up here
is the phrase they use
back down from that idea
what other own lists you 're
that 's easy .
money to someone
, you put on something like a sucker list
and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations .
makes it kind of
like public national radio or any of the public stations
and it just started soon after .
said is this terrible and just
have given to my in college alma mater old money
and it 's one thing ,
they do n't sell the list .
they call up and
they and actually be people who graduated in your class or something like that
and they say .
last year
you can do better this year ?
on here
how do you know that ?
how do you know that ?
you telling me even this ?
it is any of your business ?
one thing that
that is , just our business .
someone who is soliciting should know at for all
and that was too very offensive .
do n't know
and he 's still living by himself .
of years ago a
but he does n't want to move away .
he recently have and have an operation
but he does n't really just
he is able to do himself everything still pretty well ?
he was until this operation .
really do n't think he is doing well that now and
have one aunt that after a lot him really looks and
when he was a hundred and three in
after they put him in the home and died six weeks .
and is sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather 's feelings
because some of their life left .
and are going over a lot of people for
is just for the rest of the stay here and
they able to look after their day-to-day needs
they can after a lot of things look
that the day-to-day needs
who was my grandparents of
for them at home
and they died .
but they were all than your grandparents younger .
care of
just a very good job but .
and that is difficult part .
because is what they get often used as
and a level four type of care would
of physical care the
think at least
guilty of neglect
more it happens in areas where it is a broad social medical system where there are government medical care and that kind of thing
by the individuals
my lack of
but the majority of it is
a prime discussion topic in
certainly ca n't argue with that
do need some improvements
throw out for no reason people
think there 's a limit on that
the , peremptory challenges
think it is , four or five ,
but you can ,
ca n't remember which
last year was on a jury trial
as the last selection that the defense got out
have a severe demeanor or something
typically , but everyone gets
it be a group of your peers
through them because he wants somebody that will give him a guilty verdict if the facts warrant pick
the jury selection process is
but do n't
and more than a jury knowledge
you are talking about
made , as a recommendation
but think it should be up to the judge , and the lawyers to make
is the judge because they are the people known
a more consistent procedure
you may be right on that
preceding , according to the judicial process
and the jury 's
it is ?
did n't realize that
during the trial , not
or not have nothing to do with their background
think to what kind of sentence you 're going to lay down , but when
all the way through a jury trial
they got too boring .
so , what you 're saying is , if this .
severe more than a first offense , because obviously , did not the rehabilitation processing work the first time
got so to give them in the system or a different process that will work better hopefully either more time
when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing is
you give them the option of working off their time doing civil sort of things service .
about what collar white crimes like .
a whole lot
like what ?
what do you think ?
actually do n't think they are out of line
you trying to avoid paying taxes
are you still and
in order to circumvent the law , though , if you 're not doing what it
you do n't what if
do n't think that 's a valid argument
most people aware that they are paying percent six that sales tax not quite
the sales tax but then .
corporations , have to
should be able to avoid paying sales tax ,
at a competitive anywhere in my local area prices
outside the area for that
do n't think that 's my responsibility as a conscientious consumer
it is not your responsibility
it is also legal , for you to do that ?
from a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes into place in the next few years
right now it 's
states and can use the revenue all they can get .
with something like
then , if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion if
bought out because it 's not a burden on the consumer to remember this
is at which
but is
responsible collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding
that 's a cost of doing business .
the burden should n't be placed on the consumer .
purchasing something order mail and then have to pay sales tax on it actually talking about businesses
of the way it works my
usually , the person ordering does n't pay .
some substantial , nasty penalties and if businesses try to avoid that .
of view of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax the
that way here
that of the business
of view of a consumer the
sales tax for something but if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves .
that 's true .
just can say that consumers
no mechanism at all
just in order to establish a mechanism
do n't
your turn .
do n't think they should abolish it
, they would have as many problems as they have n't
for petty theft , but
do n't think it should be loosely used just
it should be used as a deterrent do you think ?
prevent further crime
out on the street
go down the line ten years and
on some little technicality and then they get out , and on the streets .
and that 's about the only thing .
'd , if it were someone in my family ,
had anybody in my immediate family murdered
and so would n't really know
probably would feel
is to maximize the game end value
you 've that destroy that value
of course , you have .
if so , is that a loss of value .
that 's true .
if , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person .
more than one person in order other murder
besides him
is another way you could do it weight this value by the value of the people to society .
but one way of doing it is by income .
if this guy does n't make , so he 's not worth obviously very much
his life is n't worth very much then .
the people that he murders are maybe a loss of eight hundred thousand dollars
are small , less than eight hundred thousand dollars
could you , which had something
.
that is the key right there .
is that
you 're
intimately but quite well
and you are talking about real trauma that extend beyond the counting of bodies trauma .
can imagine
losing a teenage child is of course as bad as it could get in terms of psychological impact possibly about
he was
they did find who killed him ?
they found him
and he is on for capital murder trial .
it been a long time ago
just recently .
were actually
now going through two or three years of process appeals hundred and of course
and out and out
is one way or another we now
home repair
you were helping your parents .
still are really
and we 've done lots to it .
you 're remodeling ?
about how you ?
living in an apartment now .
a friend of mine
undertook and we
we started from an empty lot with trees and stuff on it , and
and clear the lot
had called in the excavators
and went .
it was a timing fun
, time summer
and one thing is that we were going to pour the basement foundation .
we 're in the process and
and it started pouring down rain .
we have most of it to do
a lot of water
and it did n't give a very good finish really
and not a very good finish
was but
and it is only the basement floor
was so
but it kept pretty busy us .
there were me and my friend
it was n't a commercial project or something .
it was sort of just get my brother , and maybe over my cousin 's coming today to help us do that kind of thing .
materials and then coming in
and we are so hopping pretty good around .
but we got it done overall
and it 's a three bedroom , two house bath
and it is
nice .
nice .
what was for it ?
it was for my friend 's parents .
they have some property there
like a farm of
living in this old house for something like thirty years or something and .
his mom and , just wanted a new house
that been her dream
so , and we did that .
and she was
so it came
that 's great .
it gets very hot ?
it does .
in and the windows
something is conducive to temperature changes in the solar game
putting in
and we bought plate glass
my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it .
and is that it had several owners and stuff
it did go up and down ?
.
and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there .
there 's a problem with those .
they usually most of the time do n't open very well .
ours did n't .
the ones that would open and would n't want to stay open .
causes and
and it 's a never problem ending .
any really home repair things
as far as budgeting usually
we have a very detailed budget .
each for month and for gas and things like that
we want to make during that year our major purchases
want our needs and
we have a fund vacation .
we have we and then for the things that .
and we 're putting how much we 're going to need continually into those each month
the month that we 're going to have enough to get that particular item and then know .
so we very rarely buy anything on credit .
everything we buy .
my husband is a finance also major .
and we kind of have the same plan .
we have one credit card
the same amount in for retirement and .
our new thing is our budget to we have a baby and just
now we are so , each month budgeting an allowance for his education .
now that is so every month in our budget .
that 's the newest addition .
we have a set amount
that each year so
instead of just writing checks for things
and if
.
you have a separate account for that then ?
do n't know how safe it is
all at the house in a safe here
.
and so it 's
.
we have a savings account for the kids 's education .
that money goes into there .
we have children three .
so they have their own account each .
.
that money is put into each month .
does your husband deal in stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff ?
does he invest in that and
he does somewhat .
he does somewhat .
we have an investment plan .
i guess he does .
this is the first year we 've done it this way .
we really saving a lot of money
what goes into that particular thing ?
how much last year we used on per month medical much
we have it .
everything of and is taken care of .
and we are finding that we have even more money than we thought .
you do run as far as groceries and that sort of thing the budget family ?
.
all the money
and what is that ?
are all the money
that a set amount
or how do you work that ?
have a set amount
it 's very generous
and usually have extra
that can so and then go either back into our checking account
or just can carry it over
certain months of the year that you 'll spend more on food than other months
but that is up to me how completely .
home stay
, too , .
also .
it 's so kind of my money and
we have a envelope clothing for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put .
it really works out great .
we are finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that .
we have a household budget .
also , and we need a new bed .
and so we 've got of those budgeted both
in each month a certain amount
and we know
meaning three or four years ago
is now a senior in , college
in college a
got a friend that goes there , by the way
want to talk to you about that afterward ,
also was a good one to
you could say one of the problems with the disparity between different schools is the public education system and
it 's more or less a suburban school system ?
true for mine too
that money , is part of the problem in the disparity
honestly but do n't think that 's the biggest part of it
in my town , most of the parents
was to some extent
that 's true .
that 's true .
that 's true .
mandatory , tests
, before that , but there was certainly .
just sort of
picture except maybe even how that could happen to
but these people were n't obviously .
it was n't in a great area when
the whole environment and attitude towards
think that 's almost a bigger factor , than anything else probably and
the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn
sort of maybe of to get a feel for what it 's like .
think that 'd be an interesting experience
but have n't done that
ca n't
public education in
think it 's a good thing and
a public education to a private education within the same income groups
that did send their kids to private schools , if .
fairly well
the school system
and all kinds of stuff like that
that makes a big difference
, you starting in all the way eighth grade through high school
it was still three .
actually think that work pretty well
a little bit of pollution in the valley and then get .
and there 's been a lot of population growth around here .
and it is getting worse .
think most of it is from cars
and sit , and sit
it is almost sad .
living in
have about the worst air pollution
due to a lot of students to school going back and forth probably
and then we 're right also next .
checked for pollution , if you 're in certain counties ,
emissions .
have they started doing that yet ?
population up here 's a lot .
we have that here
they as the population spreads out and are expanding it to more counties here .
mandatory for more cars
there was something in the law about if your car was over a certain age , you did n't have to get it done anymore old like twenty years over
think they are eliminating that loophole and
they are eliminating that out here .
kind of like .
they could do that remotely
several different types of things
a source
they look at the source
and as the car goes by then , you can see the exhausted pipe and the source
and you can actually look at the emissions .
where do the source light go ?
across the street
they 'll set up a trap or something like that in some sense .
.
it 's an incredible amount .
hundred four times as
is that
everybody is talking
but it 's tough .
into riding the bus to work
if , but it requires several transfers
and it takes over an hour .
so it 's
we are supposed to talk .
what basically , your personal opinion is on it .
this is really for a speech research project they 're doing
so do n't know
they did ?
they have been doing it ,
,
it is now county wide program .
and then paper .
that 's good .
let this
sort out for you
it was pretty good really if you 're lazy ,
this girl to
what 's the name of that company .
we were talking one day
and she asked me
what she said .
what recycling at
it 's a little extra work .
you put your garbage in a bag garbage
it and by the curb out .
in some kind of container your trash yard
or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain dimensions , tie them up and put them by the curb .
you got to tie them up and everything .
and it 's about a foot and a half deep
and it 's about one by one and a half foot wide and long .
this is a little container .
and then they have the same size another one .
that one 's
then they have the same size a blue one for the paper goods .
you got bees and ants otherwise
and if you 've got food containers or anything like that , it 's a big problem .
that 's true .
up here , they give you one of those containers
everything in it and .
this is true .
it 's so kind of a in the butt pain .
this is true .
but do n't know
you have those people who make twenty , garbage
come up with a better system
make it a little more convenient
from the company waste management here
and it 's on wheels
and it 's big .
you can actually rent those ?
that is interesting .
the city provides them up here .
think in
but you have to rent them out in the county here .
just to your water bill or something they and on .
this talk radio station here down
n't
.
into some really good conversations
some of it , it is sometimes serious and
and they have some good feedback and all that stuff
this kind of fits into the aid program , and
the welfare program that 's going on right now .
your turn .
i start
a budget to an extent
we once a month and
and you need
about yourself ?
do n't really have
grew up in
our family income at
we do n't really need a budget
is really a budget sort of keeping
staying within
staying within
but we do n't do it by conscious effort .
just sort of it
so that presents a real shock .
and it is a beautiful place to live .
not so budget is a problem for us .
n't at least
be at
n't really but up until
was six ten hundred dollars a month or something like that
during his best year ever
stopped worrying about money
about money since then
that 's a system too .
sometimes because it is a bit of a problem .
money on taking not good advantage of , investments
you say trips then again .
, you have enough to live on
that 's a form of budgeting so .
a budget talk about budgeting
in that regard then both
how big 's your family ?
we have one on the way .
.
think it 's just going to be one
about how
have two kids
they beginning to be a problem budget
do they budget at all ?
you do have on an allowance them ?
gives them an allowance
basically ten dollars a week
half of it in the bank
gives him the other half in cold cash and
what do that i put in the bank
a hole in his pocket but at least .
if he wants to use it ,
actually
you do n't believe in it
would n't say that
said a few years ago
it was a sign of a civilized society if you did n't have capital punishment
changing my opinion , but maybe .
is not
still think it 's sort of true that a more civilized society would n't have to use capital punishment
civilized society less than
you sound like a friend of mine a lot .
she has very black and white opinions .
in her opinions no
she probably would agree with you more
but do n't know
down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again
had a punishment or a crime like a touch murder my immediate family
no remorse for what they 've done
that more and more and .
and then killed a year old girl seven
that 's fourteen years old .
what is
certainly do n't
than keeping them in jail them do anymore ,
it does n't
but , it cost less .
that 's a factor .
and
it is to me .
i work
and pay
and we 'd get along just fine .
the cost is something
think it is relatively unimportant compared to what is of the most effective way , dealing with crime , but
, do n't know
and they do n't have a problem crime either .
they do n't and
really do n't think there is too much of a relationship between the two
you might be right .
'd hate to be the person to pull the switch ,
in a million years would never
do but believe it is necessary
could n't and pull the switch
type of emotional issue for politicians
be settled once for all
for capital punishment in the , western civilized country like said
is not so sure of that
nor and around the other way for capital punishment it was
a good way of
maybe it 's a symbolic gesture more than anything else
have two friends whose wives was murdered
and can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case
we do n't even have to cook dinner anymore .
a lot of families really do n't spend a great deal of time together
something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents
is that
it seems bizarre .
the worst thing is happening in , at least the modern world today , is television
known
down just after work
have one in the house
good for you
good for you
i talk to a lot of people about that
about it myself
though a lot about it
but still have n't yet done it
that 's good .
'll tell you
television make sure
you do n't and
that 's true
have
but do n't think it 's too good
do n't think so either
, so do n't know
a great deal of time to spend with the kids
take advantage of time dinner , but
we always eat together
in sports or anything
our music outlet 's big
when our son started playing violin , violin and up took
although neither kid like to practice .
that 's not a big surprise
for kids .
read to them
and take them to the park and stuff
.
reading is so good .
took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little
that stage to
you ever seen
book
it 's called a book sleep
and you ought to get it .
think is his book sleep my favorite
like to do it
reading and .
a lot growing
until a few years and never
started picking
have found that it 's really important to me to get to read and so
like to get away in a book , ?
your kids on
an hour or two
that 's great .
my wife at night work ,
so she is gone a lot at nights
a lot of time with them and .
.
your kids
they are two and one .
two and one
you have your hands full with them , so
that 's for sure .
you consider an invasion
do n't know
what do you think ?
do n't know
has a little bit more time to think
, do n't know
how much stuff that about all the purchases
and do n't know ,
do n't know what they 've actually in there
they sell those ,
as a condition of employment drug
was thinking
drugs illegal
and they instituted a drug testing policy where they would randomly test employees
to tell you really did not and actually much think about it .
, have n't
it did n't really related to me .
like that people brought up
and , this is also against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity
so what that means to me , that is , it 's really the government that are requiring this ,
by their actions and their behavior
takes away from the job of the supervisor or type manager person who is able to evaluate them if it kinds and then of
evaluated rather than that way
do n't reveal it ?
kind of
so what about that as an invasion of privacy ?
so
it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society .
that 's been big the role of government generally
have been
that 's kind of a difficult one to go into .
that particular case
it ,
because there is a huge part of the population ,
a growing part
the population that have it , who do n't know they aids spreading it
, to require a test and then to make such again , but it is subject them to discriminatory practices and other things
, do n't know
do n't
to go ahead .
think public service is a worthy thing
are as a matter of fact and
leadership and in which have to do a public service project the key element .
to the draft
of course military service under the category of a public service fall .
and so , is military service or draft
with you but
things such as other of
either that was not what they have in mind
more of a voluntary kind of thing
say , you can
can do this thing for one or two years kind of to serve the community other or
a particular fan of
even just disciplined personal discipline about
come and out they
and they have now at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline .
that they do n't need to be cowboys
for some young men , and that 's good .
did have the personal discipline
why
went to college for four years
is
but , that 's good for some people .
do n't
that is one view .
and that is another debate .
and it seems
so , at any rate , this is getting the topic off
how do you feel about the crime in your city ?
been some increases in crime in terms of murders
kind of in scale and some other things up
personally had a little experience the other day
broke my passenger window
have a good friend there
the real problems
a lot of murders
of years a
wo n't go to the grocery store at night
you know .
and it is that kind of thing
a neighborhood watching to reduce home theft , burglary and things of that sort
you do
going back down in and then .
we have been in my apartment broken into about four times in two and a half weeks .
was situation type down there and
is the new thing
but
, that 's a good way to work , with a neighborhood watching it
people during the time they 're home
is that right ?
are the house
just slip in and then .
slip out .
that 's amazing .
exactly what they are going for
as far as a new type of crime
quite a bit
.
at particular points of the day
crime there , of course ,
but .
i guess ,
is not real sure
it helps to know your neighbors .
you are supposed to make lists of cars .
a lot of my neighbors
if , we have a list
much .
, in the organization of it
and then left right in
is not sure where we went from there ,
you be paranoid
really many things you can do so only but .
, not program as a woman go out at night
is
is one of the frustrating things about that
it is against the law to set traps , even if you know the threat is there
it is against the law to do a lot of things .
that 's not always true .
it is n't ?
where a guy knew he was going to get robbed ago
while he was home came in the guy
he fell into the trap
he did n't die ,
was severely but
took the guy to court
that make you think so .
it is
should say something
the least informed person in the whole united states
been
read a newspaper in my entire life
any particular reason ?
they have tried to lock me up and things like that .
's , but not interested basically
is
do learn about things
someone will write a book about something
'll and then learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier
read about it in the paper
but do n't
n't really
you could explain it two ways
these things doing a very good job at all
think the same thing is true with news and
the average person does n't
intelligent people written
a reasonable question it takes to keep up on things as
and most people think it 's
and it can find better ways to use it
do n't
n't
think they are saying if something is really important
that 's a reasonable start and
did n't read
could go and pick up if it were important enough to read about newspapers and then
something you cared about happened , you 'd find out from friends or other channels .
that 's the closest thing .
cared about that deeply
i sort of and planned to have
and thought that was terrific because she helped actually
but did n't even then
as far away
did n't want to waste the time
the best things to do is probably tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
if they are innocent .
.
a good southern solution
how do you feel ?
you 'd have to say that .
do n't know
whether the judge should be the one who do the sentencing was the things they asked to talk about .
think that 's the way it is now done
is n't very good at least
it seems to me that the judge does it
what a particular thing the norm is for and .
and , i guess , also what the system will .
tuned in to that probably more
though possibly on capital cases like maybe the death penalty
he could have a personal prejudice .
that 's right .
and think that may be an exception as well
the jury does n't ?
think that 's the way it is
they decide whether or not the accused or what would get the death penalty .
is they in fact
and there 's a big uproar on going right now .
like something have got no problem with it .
as revenge of
put it to sleep
, just to get out
it 's not able to fit in .
something inexpensive
if somebody got the death penalty , they are
they got the death penalty ,
they should have one year and one appeal .
by mistake
and you 'd hate to be one of those .
is sure
maybe .
do n't know
'd think they 'd have to be unanimous at
it is
how ever many are .
believe that 's the way it is
are pretty sure you are correct on capital cases but
and they say they are hopelessly deadlocked .
and the judge told them , they were n't hopelessly deadlocked yet .
one way
that probably is an expensive trial .
so far they said six months .
probably
probably
is not sure that there is a number
they could go with a hundred nine number
that been going on
so she pretty closely follows that stuff .
that is interesting .
she is not
but she does ,
have you ever on a jury served ?
have n't
have never
my wife
but have n't
got
but never got
while they went through the process selection , sat for ten days in a court room
they have himself and some guy was defending .
to go ahead .
job or anything new
have n't
, in my job , but is
this is
do n't
if they can .
have you had any experience with it at all ?
really
have always , but
before they got jobs and stuff summer
so what does you think ?
do n't think they are very accurate
afterwards they changed
of that too
and you can get a job because of it not
they may not and tell you
had a friend ,
it did n't cause her any problems with her job
, it was she had been , in the jungle
it was some medication malaria and
she positive for that
and so it 's really a dangerous thing
and did n't get the job
and they were n't told why
a lot of people say
they or would tell you .
this person or use never any drugs .
you positive , for more tests
you should .
because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something .
have real mixed feelings about it
do n't know
you do
of error a
the accuracy ?
do n't know
do n't know
a lot of things that can influence them
think a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time and
for a job recently
and my doctor gave me a prescription for it .
, you have proof that your doctor ordered for you this
and it did n't
but this could happen to anybody
and if they would just say we wo n't hire them then you could lose out on a job when you did n't really do anything
so do n't know
is that who needed and
is not sure either
then they have the right to go ahead and prove it if they really suspect
because they say they can spot check .
can see a problem if you 're using it while at a job
but the occasional person , then it 's an almost infringement of your privacy .
it sort of 's .
this is it , and
can see from two ways
would n't want somebody to take care of me that were using drugs as
feel so as
that they do n't test for too my patients
you 've trust some place along the way
you ca n't go around testing for everything everybody .
so do n't know
think if someone were out a company or a boss could use this
they could keep on doing this to you or something , i guess .
can see where it could become a problem
it seems like now they have tests and
they can test your hair
can drugs up to several years ago and
responsible for something you did several years ago
known
that 's the other thing .
a lot of people as kids or young people get
and do n't
a lot of
but you ca n't say it was wrong at the time .
think that 's true
so that probably would n't be either too good .
our 's discussion about
that 's right ,
that 's right .
think is important ?
do n't
would look for what was ready parents or grandparents it is , but if you have ?
he by himself lives and
and he is in good shape .
but have gone through this
any experience with
go there and once a year .
so we 're pretty far away .
do n't know about it too much there
but it seems nice enough .
it 's hard ,
at least half of the residents
means from the lack of stimulation .
do n't know
my wife and i volunteer go that is just a mile from our house
she goes more often .
we used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there .
and we have a year old son two
so we 'd take with us and sometimes him .
and is the same thing
it 's a nice relatively environment
care of themselves in their own house but again .
walk the halls and see
you had some experience with
much as to can be
what 's normal for this person
is not catering to this person 's needs
it is possible ,
be as of
saw that were really nice
we saw a husband and wife ,
a husband and wife
and they were in the same room was not all husband and wives
but these two was .
when you walked into their room , and they have brought all their furniture from their house
so it gives them a sense of identity .
you walked in there
walk into some rooms
there 's nothing , maybe a picture or two who belongs
and is that it .
and they have all their stuff from their house
to walk in there , and talk to them
part of
also a lot of social activities but .
when they were away on vacation and she was
that it on the grounds
are
you want to go ahead and start talking
have two kids and all but
had a budget
do n't do any planning and
and do n't know ,
do n't have a long-term financial planning
do n't try to control my expenses
but is glad you are a stranger
kind of like me
but really is
maybe we should start with you so .
what do you do ?
about the same thing
maybe they 're going to arrest both us .
are even in worse shape
from hand to mouth
of the month to pay for the bills the
of a
and they worked
enough to keep doing it
and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope
then and did n't have any more money to spend in that area
did n't we and
it was just when that was empty , you knew you were out of money .
that pretty for about three months
and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in other the envelope
and we were back in about two months .
this was a sort of a shift career at the time and
were willing to take a half job and time to do that so
actually did , and
of the month the
have , but
did n't keep a balance
it is one of the problems .
never had to in
always kept plenty of money in my checking account ,
things would
is to keep a piece of paper in my wallet and sometimes
mostly spent cash money
write the things down
went ever as far as three months in keeping that kind of data or not
money out of that
and take out of my checking account that
so leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account
so in the checking account is always somewhat different that what 's really there
i figure that gives me room for the i make mistakes and .
say have
see 's
do n't run out of money on at
n't and
is not to spend money
do n't have expensive tastes
do n't go out
to buy a car ,
people were embarrassed for me .
it was a good car
but it was still running .
it was great .
it would n't stop and just .
for a new car the
like it is n't .
eat expensive food
do n't mind buying a good steak
maybe once a month but only for me .
less than half a pound , you buy
so it 's six or seven dollars .
you 're not going to run out and do that if you have eight kids
not very often .
but , is that a drop in the bucket .
on how you buy food , it does n't add up
that 's right .
do n't have to hold myself
for sort of company
or a little place
i work for the facility research
in a sense of
but it does have , about two civil thousand employees .
it is still considered small
it just have a lot of different laboratories .
so the area i work in , primarily it have maybe a hundred people .
so that make up most of the laboratory
from that standpoint , so it 's pretty small .
what about yourself ?
similar kind of place probably
.
so it 's very much the same kind of the technical institution place .
do n't know
what sorts of things
those and the security aspect of it probably
and it may not be true in every place .
more like a number instead of a person
off just
think that the company still exist
what they use to do is they used to cut
would n't that that one person get one big blunt blow at one time
unemployment 's good
the company as
the company 's making money , even
they paying a salary you
you responsible for that growth company
it at at making profits are
there or some kind of clause that will subsidize if they did lose people
not on the up and up all the time
do n't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but a number of people can be the downfall of a company situation
how do you mean that ?
you 're going to lay off these people ten .
what about the effort work those ten people did when the company was doing well .
in that standpoint
among all the employees of the company to spread the effort
.
really .
think it 'd be better that way
give the person at least
reason to look for another job instead of just dumping on them all at one time it and .
that 's my views .
of companies that have done that a
and give a half days a week off everybody ,
think and
what would give a person a chance to look because the way it is
how many children
have five
you have five ?
finding time
four of them grown
they are in college or just out of college
you so young .
i working at it
have them
try to fool everybody
think you 're doing a good job
have just one child
can do about
think
because was an child only too
's big the family and
so she is sort of like an only child and
and it is the same type of thing ,
have a younger brother like that
and have a in his twenties brother
and was
how that worked so
like he had fathers five or something
that is exactly how it is .
and to take her brother
she calls just when one of them .
it 's a little bit difficult , though .
organized things like little soccer league
we did not really .
we did and a lot of things together .
all over the world for her to compete and perform
that was a lot of fun and .
you could
there are all the time a competition .
we were very heavy into that .
or mainly school sports and things
think that 's true probably
if you have one child or fewer , you gets
n't if you have a large number of children and then
you ca n't afford to .
there is not enough time and
my son 's in little league this year .
he is ten .
and they practice three times a week
and they have a game
if there were more than one child there would be no way to do it .
that 's right .
go one direction
'd and
and we could cover two at that only .
she had to go with me .
and a lot of time competing
the matter what it was , of course , and competing itself , did n't really
it was making the friends and going all the places
it was a really neat experience , and
but it took our total time .
did not
full-time now
to get her just activities in and still have
three children 's probably
's , but not
could n't educate three most certainly
do n't know how my parents did it
there was five of us
and do n't
but do n't know how my father did it
he worked at a truck line
he did n't just and make that kind of money with five children .
but okay we did .
now , but
do n't believe we have as much as my parents and
we have only one child and .
things cost a lot more .
and do n't think our part of the country 's particularly bad compared to some
it is ?
from talking to them , and they are
is that
they sell their house ,
good a bit of money
and , i work with a lot of them
they think they 've done something really .
is the cost of living
the housing is cheaper ,
but that 's about it .
is
try to stay away from as much as possible in terms of repair cars
that is really a sore spot with me actually .
perhaps the automotive industry 's improving
that , but the capability of service departments and dealerships repair and was not only equally dismal
that care of my car and myself is not my cup of tea .
so do you have a car ?
do you have a car ?
and it was n't as bad .
and is that it .
and it is
and they are good .
they 're really good cars .
going to an auto place repair taken
bad .
woman goes in
go and we got a sucker .
how much money we can get out of her
that 's what happens every time .
what do you 've ?
just and it
so .
just ago this happened .
when he was my husband just a few months ago this car his father gave us
and everything is wrong with it .
power fluid leaks
the oil leaks ,
is the car ?
and he just do n't take care of things
was but
can trust him and
is so
go into a place repair
who last a repair shop , the man told me
okay so said
and he charged me a hundred and thirty something
about a month later , and then a men were looking at my car
not a man repair but just a friend
was telling him
he said and that 's not a new master cylinder
and did n't even know what was one
he showed it to me and
and it was
it was no new more than nothing .
so it was apparently the same one who were on there .
more than likely
and that was it .
that was , probably it .
was so irritated
to me more than once or twice
so what 's the solution to that ?
a reputable service
you can find hardly and one .
the guy who are doing most of my car now goes to my church
and that 's
he will tell me the truth and
because he does n't even charge me for doing it
so he 's not going to take me .
i just pay for the parts
and he does it
is that
you 're lucky .
,
so do n't know
do n't know what the solution to that is
the place where you buy your car , because they are usually of all the worst one .
they telling us we needed a new brand engine for our car and ended up .
and so , neither idiots as we were
they told us we had just have one
and we bought one .
no new engine more
give me .
it was not so good
been in one
but my grandparents were looking into it before
said they
is
was they and
she had all kinds of trouble and when
was she
she sort of
too much of
and they could n't deal with her .
handle the kind of patients
my grandparents wanted to still have
and a nurse on just in case they needed her staff
but they want to be independent as well .
there were some sort of full-time place that were associated with it also care
and then as become less able to take she , then she moved into other this part that was able to provide full-time care
and she did n't have to do anything anymore .
my experience but .
in there or what is the reason they get
is only six months or something
is a lot of it
they need health care
before they ill already is so .
that is a large factor probably .
or have what someone can take
then go there only as a last resort .
as a last resort people or send you there .
of mind knowing if anything happened there for them , there were somebody peace
was so that
somebody would know what to do in the event of an emergency
that 's a problem too for people
i guess
you ca n't always
of course , and you ca n't just sit around and wait .
when you need it , you need it .
also is the money and another issue .
at that stage of life you have only so much money
it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
it is kind of fair ,
but it also is not fair because they have their own children to raise .
so it is another problem .
if it were you , and probably would n't you want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest prices
just so anymore
are you and with medicine being the way it is
and they are not necessarily enjoying life anymore .
just a shame
think the home retirement idea is a nice idea
quite a few people
do n't know if they have them back there
had three boys through some child care , each one of them
and they are now in school
so it 's all over
what most parents would want but .
is due with my first in about three months
is that right .
behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that good
if they are associated with a college or a university , they are usually a pretty good bet
it 's when you buy a car or refrigerator something
you 're absolutely right there
was when my kids was young , but
child care associated with our university
felt so confident that they 'd do right
do n't them for their pet theories or some such thing ?
you mean learning type ,
get your permission
but
if there 's a psychology department or an education department around , you might find they are pushing one form of education or another ,
that 's true
but never had bad experience in that respect
associated with the university and the hospital as the parents
they , pretty good people and
the sexual abuse cases
and you 'd just feel awful if something like that happened .
never really very much
made public
never really worried so too much about that being , the case with my boys
those things get immediately when
do n't think it 's as common as the newspapers would make you believe
and another thing is cost .
having babies right now
the decision my wife would stay home until the boys was in school
and we did it , although it was very , very difficult
and think it was the right thing to do
we just decided and we would do it
we went ahead and
but not everybody can make that choice
even though my wife was n't working , and we did have one or another of the boys in child care for just part of the day
so , did we look around .
always so would trust her judgment on that
is
my husband just got a new job .
his last company , he was only working four days a week .
and he just got a new job .
he is getting lots of overtime ,
he got a pay raise
we do n't have to worry so much
there are absolutely no question that you 're going to be the best for that kid provider child care
so
it as long do .
i
you look through a place
what they 've kind of staff members
you have to determine that they are open perfectly
they do n't want you
you have friends that have kids being taken care of child care in other ?
have one
really have a chance to talk
cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and things like
this is true .
current affair can get several shows , .
what do you think ?
terribly on what life was like
, can be
go ahead .
obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change .
you did n't have video games .
you did n't have home computers .
into a business today
and , you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of paper carbon
everything fax .
we do n't even wait for the mail anymore .
about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail
had and
was this
to do so they had it and if they had business .
it because you can get it in a matter of minutes through a fax machine there and is now
work on stuff up until
and , that said stress today is so much worse .
it should be less because we have a microwave
we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes and
and we have no time down .
we do n't have to
so we keep moving .
the next thing to
so we have no time in between relaxation
and a lot of ways get your time
that is so good .
is that
think , but just
of course is a part of it technology .
some is that of
but , we have all single families .
so many now single families .
both parents working
so there 's a whole big effect on our kids
not really many of my daughter 's friends and .
is wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
there is that
fewer and fewer couples deciding to have kids who generally tend to happen
you 're probably right .
never really occurred to me
but that is interesting .
really never thought about it that way
the numbers on
that 's true .
when is this good or not good .
we do n't know that yet .
an , extremely large part of the next generation is going to be , second generation from immigrant parents .
do n't know either
that 's true .
and they 're going to be really struggling
it is the accomplishment once it was no longer
and not do n't think
that 's kind of scary .
that 's true .
it 's very , very different just
every ten years it 's been very different just and .
do n't know what 's going to happen
people having much later in life their children
they 've got their homes and
and you start
think the court systems could stand some improvement
by jury trial is good
do n't know
think so .
and that 's the sort of system they have .
they are like i guess lawyers .
they are experts in the law
and there is n't really a jury
also the questioning and .
the judges
's , but not
the jury system myself
the jury
your chances better
of judges or jury a
is what i worry about
that is where you really need a jury of peers .
because you need the protection of ordinary citizens .
that 's true .
think that 's really the only thing
all the time
maybe a judge is a better judge of that
the sentencing sometimes is not fair .
they do decide that
, but is like you
, do n't know
maybe is
think they should be in a lot of cases ,
twelve people into a courtroom , i trust
that are usually a matter of what facts to believe .
people do n't have days in day out long experience with what prison life and
a hung jury atmosphere
think , but in a lot of places
a for jury or whether the judge gets to choose it
some cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that .
i kind of like .
that 's not a bad system .
do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit , but
blow lawyers and .
before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
insurance cases and things like .
of people 's heart strings and making them cry this
putting on a act
, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government
have you have that recently experience ?
recently ,
ca n't really recently say
believe it was one of these , mixers
because it was my fault
about what you ?
do n't have so much trouble with products as service
do n't feel like a problem as big
have had a lot of trouble with them correctly working
is not a hundred percent and
, most of the time
but is that it .
but that is probably the worst .
do n't know if you have that
is what sells silver sterling things but
and the catch broke
and she was sitting in school on a carpet
when she stood up , and it caught
and we took it back
and they said .
was
they were
and so we wanted a different kind of catch
and she said .
nothing is apparently
do so
so we got the kind we wanted
and was
this was a company that should have been more reliable
a birthday for one of her friends
call to see if they had it and there
the lady and was very nice .
, said and my goodness
you 've been very nice ,
what 's your name .
and she told me
said it and
seems to be a big problem in that , store attitude
it turned out she was the assistant manager and
at least you are talking to somebody who counts .
felt kind of good about that
did n't even know what the person 's name had given me
did something at least
maybe they 'll fix it .
they might work on that .
of a problem
service is more of a problem .
up here in the northeast we have these companies like bean l l mail order
they 'll do things like this actually .
backwards service for you
they have eight hundred numbers
that 's really great .
the number of the customer service line support for a number of companies hundred eight
have actually and
most of them , and have been pretty good
the customer 's always right
might be over the phone
they make and if you are properly
that 's really good .
be like that
do n't
things getting rough out there
the morale among employees tend to go down
we kept that going for about a month and
we gave up on it
about right
various kinds of and so worth
or are not getting ahead , falling behind or staying even
that 's really about the extent of the kind of financial keeping score that we 're doing .
it is kind of difficult for me .
that 's terrible .
a lot
how to have to bring in a month
and that 's about it .
about as far as
.
are
is a single mother
have children three
,
right now , so we get because there is no other way to do it .
so right
balance more or less
all my state aid
do n't get enough to meet the bills and then if
every single month and it is
hope they 'll call in
but they probably wo n't because the kids next week have vacation school .
.
the four days before , they have only a week four days
.
they do n't like to be absent before a vacation .
in every pence
his company went bankrupt .
it was
do n't know what a company 's shoe running a computer company doing
and they gave them jobs at the corporate front office
was and
hang on
somebody were knocking on my door here .
it sounds
you even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people might be probably
do you have a computer at home
.
track of every pence
is at the computer
.
what came in yet
do you use a standard spread sheet
claim them as this year
it this way
of years the past
why
partly due to ownership
put his foot in his mouth every time
some financial problems with
it recently were sold to some other people and
have been to a few games before
so you 've got two football teams down there .
so we have , as far as one football team .
.
that 's how it is .
there is that type of segregation ?
are it
it 's really ,
so we 've got our cowboys here
do n't think anybody
do you ,
and he is for the raiders .
you do follow professional sports at all ?
started to this year because of these silly raiders that did n't very well done , just
have been trying more this year , but
know a little more than i use
never very much at all
is so
it 's a good past time .
particularly football
and they get together with a bunch of guys
and they have a good time and everything
so should n't try to do it even ?
it 's good in terms of a contest .
it has the speed .
the eye coordination hand and
we might .
do we ?
you know , probably
do n't know
nobody talk about it
so do n't
and we have a soccer team that comes and goes .
we do n't even have very much that ,
that professional football in
they have this world football league .
,
, national football league in
but they have now what is called the world football league
there are in the united states teams and
and they are now playing during the summer months
and there are so much football only you can watch .
do n't like to watch
that 's good .
do n't like to watch anything
think it 's an , excuse to do nothing
what you 're saying about the male bonding
the guys and got together
and that 's
that is fun .
you ever be to a professional football game
have
have you ?
have
actually .
that 's what you got to do .
that for college football
the same thing
for these games to go out there are about six or eight guys we use
our wives into
and they have a real good time
and it was basically for the social atmosphere .
and that 's the thing .
three or four hours before the game .
you go up .
a table
it 's not so much the contest itself and the game itself ,
the whole atmosphere of
you sitting in your parlor with a pack of beer and some potato chips six home
that 's right .
.
that 's right .
any sport professional
the atmosphere of being there
went to every football game in
still do n't know that much about football , obviously
, but still have a good time
the question were talking about the juries
those people come again and again
so that a judge would be the most appropriate person be
may have not even in some cases the jury , the person
if they are judged and would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing
with you .
instead , they have a mock court
it is supposed to be all legal and everything .
going
you present , and
present their case
and you 're
backlog of all it did n't .
really if we could do it that way
not a jury trial
we do n't agree
criminal cases one of the parties want
it is usually and the defendant who want to have the jury hear the case .
a change in
and did n't mean that
did n't mean
had my civil rights
meant for some when both parties agreed , we 're going to have a judge here , but
we 're not going to have a jury ,
over it with
sort of car accidents
is that
i think , that you can waive the right to a , jury trial
agree
they have to have a jury trial
giving a different sentencing .
the take
, though doing criminals rather
is that right ?
maybe the use of the jury is very , often to the lawyer 's advantage in the case , civil things of
cases where they could be settled , maybe out of court a little more efficiently
it is to their advantage to as big an audience , as possible to play
not just in a criminal cases sentencing
is in favor of that
is in favor of it for criminal cases but
so there is a difference of my view for those two there .
have n't been in too many chambers judges or anything like that
have you have to serve jury duty ever ?
was doing so many other things that they took on me pity , but
out
and that was almost twenty years ago .
sort of
that would have been too about twenty years
just last year
and was a criminal case
and it seemed , trivial really .
it involved two bicycles .
we did n't do the sentencing .
the judge did .
how interesting
a verdict
the judge was and then the one to do the sentencing .
involved in electronics , a long time
maybe about a year and a half ago ,
it 's a real easy to use color computer
and got a very nice printer that goes along with it
and he use it for his work school .
is currently in school
have found and to it
it 's very essential for me .
schools , have them
lot of times difficult to get on them at school , but so
have one at home
going
.
in
some games , of course
have a program that allow me to access a weather data bank and
so can check up on the weather around the country 's whatever which a hobby
so , it provides other than just strict computations and so on
do you have a computer for yourself at home ?
have just one for my son
a big market for
just through development system
find myself using the computer , but now
even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communications system .
but
so it 's really become my mainstay i guess .
ca n't even remember ,
used and even that
did my master 's thesis on a typewriter
and it was a pretty big deal .
it must have been tough .
it 's a little bit strange for me .
did my master 's thesis last year
and on a computer that did
just ca n't imagine how people did before it
it must have been so much just work .
then it was just a completely different world .
you like that kind of computer do ?
, like
like really from a distance
the packages on
and it 's nice .
really do n't use it myself
home from , i , work like when to stay far away from computers and electronic things .
my son do it
it 's sort of a joke
but it 's really true ,
just the kids , and they take it like candy .
not very good
it 's not been a good day .
turned mine in about twelve hours at noon early
do n't know
so hope she 's turned in it
are
go ahead
'll stop eating
barely just got home from the university
to say what ?
barely just got home from the university
what we can do is
after five minutes when the voice comes on , and then we can
go ahead
fire away
but is probably in the minority
with you .
i guess
the sales tax and ca n't .
think that 's regressive
and it is
the eight and half a sales tax percent
but do n't on the other hand
it 's not on that .
nobody taxes groceries .
.
where
is that right ?
but we have a pretty low tax rate here .
think the sales tax , they just got to do something about it
as a percentage of total income , all taxes
as low as
not sure
'd have to live there then , and
means living in spite of higher taxes
higher taxes
that 's true ,
probably so now than it was or ten years ago
still is to some extent that way .
you about to can do something
and you 're not quite in the same situation
school for me taxes but
have to pay for all of my school taxes
a little on you
that 's a decision ,
that 's all right
will not mind paying what it takes to keep the good schools when
that is always
think , though , is that you just
,
that 's true .
such a small minority that they ca n't get anything to do and .
that seem like a cultural lapse .
ante up for the schools
increased the fire department and cut down because it means to them more rather
it is
roads
with the benefits that we have working
for me , and there are absolutely no question is the most important benefit
think it 's health care
think everybody would say that
and if you try to get it outside of your corporation , you 're going to pay an arm and a leg .
sometimes think it is more important than salary
you do
do n't know
it can turn out to be important but since .
you know
known
in a given year , dental expenses can kill you really .
and he got
and we have children four
's outrageous and
people do n't have it
n't or maybe
that 's right .
that 's right .
that would be up there
that compared to retirement
think is a great benefit
you do n't get your hands on it first
you can offer some incentive when
but what about , lesser benefits , perhaps , for the women in the corporation for you
leave ?
do they have father leaves or anything like that ?
do n't think so yet
they may have just plain parental leave , which either one can take .
, too , .
we talk about years rather than months or weeks
is n't
desperately needs , and at her
a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time
.
it 's important to families then so
anybody who 's got far enough to get a good salary and is really reluctant to give that up yet
especially in this day and age
you do n't want to start over again anywhere .
you 're right .
would like to see changed most
they come a long way
at least some companies
and they have a very , very poor left policy as manager
and just do n't
particularly , single parents
some extended family is unlikely
that 's right .
that is exactly right .
and it 's just a terrible choice ,
you should n't have to make it .
you 're right .
, of course , we get
like to have that
it is
only the trouble is , you can afford to go anywhere
but you ca n't
listen
have friends in a lot of different cities
fly just care of that , if you .
that 's right .
you have to have an awful lot of fun
be half the fun
really a necessary in a civilized society
at taxes because
and so it as a result is a trade-off for the common good for the benefit of others
how much you ever thought that money should go to of
you take care of your own self that you do n't need the money for
other people do n't really need it either ,
it but yet .
wanted to become a book reader permanently just
so many people
a good woman , and probably
care of me
and then you do n't have to be on the roll tax .
difficult kind of thing
everybody and hate it really .
it was very timely .
pay my deductions
wind up so .
that 's always a smile .
have but of course
should and better calculate it
in business for yourself
i work for
is so a federal employee
do n't sound like it ?
think just as against taxes as everybody else
you work for internal revenue
have got all four feet in the trough being a federal employee
can understand who got benefits but
there is no every time on every one of them a bond issue i vote
but , this is , not tax revolt country .
so it 's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a situation revolt tax .
thinking about retirement and sort of thing that
and they are building old people 's homes at tax expense .
and go where it is cheaper
that 's right .
instead , it 's the taxes here
certainly lots of
is the only place you can reduce really
is how to be able to lessen their cost of living
five or six years before
and ca n't really stay here as a retiree
after
it 's too expensive .
is going to have
in the same situation
their home is paid for
their taxes so high , my father do n't feel like he can retire because they could n't pay their taxes
and they have no children in school or anything now .
a lot of the taxes
and they 're doing it again , not .
you must be what ?
is not
do you work
do n't work
is a student
to school
is
do n't
what do you drive now ?
throw them in the back
fit our requirement
cab .
they just so and fit in there .
they be teenagers with long legs
can throw in the back when we have room them all right now
things in the back
go there .
and i kind of like having a pickup truck .
, i think of it , as a car that
known
like the way trucks
and do n't care about comfort
so are pretty happy
could throw in the back too people ,
got a runner four so
so would n't hesitate to get another one
never buy new
would n't so
you 're just like me .
bought a new vehicle in my life
and
do n't need to pay for the glitz
have the showroom shine
and 'll pay for the rest of it
, let somebody else break it in
we might go on a van again .
in a sedan next time a
is not sure
of years a
we were and real happy with that because my second requirement after prices are low maintenance .
and it certainly have that .
we did n't do much to it at all .
pretty much the
it pretty much and do
pounds thousand three
so can
and it 's real reliable ,
for almost four years now have it
it up until two weeks ago and had anything wrong with it
, do n't know
did n't do any damage to it
caught it real early
miles at how many
so it 's not real early .
never
went out and looked
saw where it was coming from .
the shop and left off it .
that was it and
that 's sort of my , hobby though more than a vehicle .
, do n't know
he is pretty conservative guy .
do n't think it 's much of a sport for him
known
really i bet you he but .
is sure he does ,
the last time you took out your truck
twice a week on the bike
but
might get , a new car , but not necessarily a new car , another car
an open bed just throw in stuff
you got one .
be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back
have just out of the way
have it out of the way
but they 're solid .
they last a lot longer than anything else
kind of like
it 's a really nice truck .
heard about that ,
it is beautiful .
that thing will last forever ,
that 's a serious truck .
a boat engine
a contractor got just one of those
are he
think about this ?
you do have children in school ?
.
just about ready to from college now
entering school just
think they are just entirely pushing them
in before then
a lot of testing ?
too
think that 's awful
you have to be
known
what is the new criteria .
do you 've now ?
all kinds of
and it 's over and over .
, and
but it 's a very transient community .
a lot of people everywhere ,
most of them from other places and
lots of industry coming in
and it 's a very wealthy community .
is
seem , other people , but
and would
they but .
you would like to know what they 're doing .
, would
really would
they have just beautiful , beautiful homes
and they have everything .
only the kids wear things to school brand name
and it is one of these things ,
make it hard for you
it does .
and do it .
to
where she feels different , but
some of them very rich
it 's hard to explain why you ca n't to them .
have so , everything here and
and we have a very goal .
the kids but .
and it 's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody ca n't be first
and they are expected to be .
their parents
the teachers
if , and they are far .
and a whole lot of pushing on these tests to do well
how about the kids
are
not very .
they have to get a good night 's sleeping and eat right in the morning before , tests
they make a big deal .
to me , the paper should be just that day put on the desk
just say and .
better that way
rather than
out of high school
and they 've always done this here .
it is always
but it is getting worse and worse ,
more pressure for everything is .
and just think it 's really awful
and is with you on that
you do n't hear too many people
think it 's a very long day , but
it is .
once you are only a kid and you do n't want to spend your whole life in school
that 's right .
my son come home
and he said .
we hardly ever
and do n't think that 's right
.
lessons , gymnastics , piano
great to be
just so this a real problem and .
think if they 're going to be there all day , they should find time
and she had a home for like four hours a week teacher
when she went back in six weeks , and she was ahead .
so what does that tell you ?
is that right ?
a whole lot of
and they could be better using this time .
think something a little more interesting and
.
working parents have
would n't
i doubt if they would say was too long .
them take care of them all day
do you have the before care , at your school and the school after care school ?
back as far as
that 's my time before actually .
and we found it was a very liberal kind of community .
feel really , but the law enforcement community put these people behind bars
these groups lawyer and then got together
be in the system to do that changed
capital punishment was
the appeal process is really getting in the way but .
thinks the way the law , currently stands
it 's more they are not enforcing the death penalty itself .
death row on
but you 'll stay there for twenty years .
nothing and is being done about it .
and it 's really getting out of hand in many states .
's , at this juncture
is not sure what constitutes a technicality
that is about
all these cases court
and he tried to appeal his conviction .
and it did n't work .
will everybody who got enough money
or you become a ward of somebody
you were his slave and .
if he did n't like what you did , and he killed you .
and that 's pretty effective .
it 's not good for civil rights , i guess ,
get along in the community
on by civilian authority in criminal actions , especially murder cases , and that sort of thing
there have been a lot of cases of people being tried or wrongly punished wrongly , typically in
and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is
the government gives tests to all applicants new drug coming
and do n't see wrong with it anything ,
if you 're a drug user you have
in my organization we have deep checks background
but , sometimes drug use can escape that .
if he is fallen in love with drugs and there is n't anything but of course , .
is
probably is a little more toward the other direction
there are two sides to it i guess .
if you 're coming under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol to work
you 're doing in your own private life
part of the reason that there are and .
prohibition for
and then we did n't have prohibition .
a little longer maybe
who know
certainly did n't prohibition last .
so much criminal activity
but you got to look at prohibition though .
you have the same problems there ?
habits with things like burglary or prostitution or stuff like that drug
you look at prohibition
because it is illegal , it cost more .
face it
you can buy pharmaceutical cocaine grade for ten or twenty dollars an ounce .
must admit that ,
'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home
but
that 's why there are people dealing it because there 's money in it .
there 's ridiculous amounts of money .
another one will jump up and then .
there 's no way you 're going to win that ever .
the prices up , the incentive there 's more
that 's a losing fight .
if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand
people but
goes back to what can society .
somebody be a good productive citizen
do n't think you can
everybody , ought to do their own share .
is too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff
it 's an easy for me one
think there 's something wrong seriously ,
particularly upset about
exactly what public education
with my feet
my kids and .
your kids getting in the parochial schools that they would n't get in the public school system
one hundred percent of the care customers .
that is one thing .
the kids getting
and they take an relatively active part .
if you 're sending every year two thousand dollars that way ,
and you participate and
and you can
the taxpayer who are paying really through the pocketbook for the education of the child also may not be quite so conscious
consequently is they and they 'd like to see them happen ?
the immediacy just are n't there .
think this is a cultural problem and actually
the problem with public education really is a problem with the culture .
and you ca n't get a tax levy passed .
think that 's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we that education was first used to have our kids even if it were n't
think that 's the principal problem
and there 's an immediate problem .
seems to be with my purse particular strings rather than the public good
by the public good and at least , for some of us , include
it means
and education to do the reading and to come up with a decision
i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution .
was
was education for civic participation
the idea was everybody should have an education so they would be a better voter
you could n't and pull the wool over their eyes .
it taken on a profound , economic thrust more
was going to say
there be really three reasons for education
one 's education for civic duty .
one 's education for economic reasons .
one 's education for civilization and .
is glad that you added that one
thought that one is significant .
was a college professor
's education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs , but
people in the education establishment really know
and is
would have
the educational establishment become part of the problem
is , in favor of these programs choice sort of
you said so far
and should be doing
the things that you mentioned three and .
too kids ?
.
laugh .
how many ,
what ages ?
and we had five .
you have been through the fun part .
about how
have a four and a half and a three
is sure that there 's a lot of differences in the way it is done now and then
but not did when mine was growing up
to spend about ten minutes with each one of them
so it was an hour .
, telling them stories or reading to them
the age difference between
six years .
they were so close real all ?
that 's tough .
that 's a lot of time .
and we wonder how we did
did you both work ?
she never did .
.
she worked at home
my husband , and i work both
have very little time each evening
though that are plenty .
he while and spend a lot of time with them
time with them and then while he is doing other stuff .
and , of course , we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend .
may my house not
but it 's
it is straight
can stuff with my kids and
you 're not going to have a neat house with kids .
have
it is to find time and especially with of them both working tough .
that 's true .
it is .
that 's true .
you 've just to set the time and say
that 's true
a lot of that on the weekends and .
they are not
a lot of things together family and .
we 're kind of this weekend going the other direction .
and just
this is the first time we have gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago .
that is too good .
that 's good that too way .
you need plan the quality time
they say all it takes is about five , a day ten minutes .
what the kids got
and they think that 's a family activity .
that 's great fun .
and
of course , you can .
them talking that way
and what would you do ,
what ?
discuss everything that did n't agree with them
and we 'd take turns being president .
and everyone would get one vote .
but it never worked that way .
whatever issue kind of was
and we could bring up too stuff .
then , and
that was always and good time .
we really got to know the kids well .
i
you still have a very close relationship with them
is that
that type of
or you have a problem with what we did how we did it
we did too .
we have a friend of hers who used to drive us up a tree
do n't make , of your friends fun
fun of mine
kind of hit us between the eyes .
you do n't
but that was always quality good time for us .
that 's good .
idea that
never and then
if they missed it , but they have abide by the rules .
was on
and they 'd show up .
think that 's great
we 'd and usually take notes
the younger kids or maybe of them all needed and help at one time or another .
but they usually was tougher on themselves than they were on us .
and they loved it .
think that 's true
think would be a fair punishment
and we always would come up with something that was harder than what they would have done .
do think it 's right that they are harder on themselves
for you and your husband
is
how you doing ?
pretty good
jury or how we would change
is
your thoughts on
decisions have to be unanimous
think that 's a good thing probably
it is probably the safest thing .
simple majority and wo n't do .
definitely
but do n't know
could n't believe they suggested judges should be doing the sentencing
them a little too much power
or .
plus you may be doing a guilty verdict
but it may be for technical reasons .
the process up a bit
and things like that
if the judge was doing it himself , without any checks and balances who is say .
there would be much more of that .
no doubt .
you involved in the legal system at all
follow it just to know what 's going on but
got
too
one of them just got his degree law .
's real familiar with the system of jurisprudence right now it 's the way , but not
have n't really
who is right .
is sure of it
it is a matter of viewpoint largely .
kind of
, do n't know
always thought and about watching the people 's court or something get .
known
in some pretrial stuff
it 's pretty amazing .
and it 's like the truth is n't really important anymore .
this friend of
and he really get .
sue just about just for the chance
it is wasting people 's time and the taxpayers ' money , and everything else .
that sounds like a little abuse of our system
people do n't want to take responsibility .
they are looking to place blame .
is that right ?
was just thinking
and the rest of the country 's or something like that not .
pretty strange
might have to go as a witness in
he may subpoena me .
so we 'll see what happens .
is not really sure how we could change
too many big problems
there is such a backlog of court cases right now .
known
and we have already as it is too many lawyers .
if it 's criminal cases and you ca n't
that 's true .
is some go and in fact
do n't have room for them
that 's not a good solution either .
at all .
you do have any special interest in space flight ?
a lot of people got
very exciting
and to meet and to see it actually happen .
have of course
that unfortunately , but seems .
what do you do now ?
programmer computer
unfortunately , that can
.
the wrong career choice up
stuff more in space than we
frustrating at times
know about all that
's kind of young
as far as with the space shuttle and all happened in my lifetime .
it would be great if we could find some way , to use that to boost the economy .
felt one of the long-term solutions would be have some sort of power solar satellites up always
power as much as
a matter of it just how big
so you are talking about then positive side effects .
i
that makes a lot of sense .
, of course , that 's the only problem .
and they want to do the research
do it for
unfortunately , and that 's not .
people say we did it after
we now be done .
we now be done .
this stuff space
'd give almost anything to get into space , but
think you 're right
too would
what do you think about capital punishment ?
's kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
which crimes
degree first murder warrants it probably
, the death penalty
and they are pretty liberal on it .
to go ahead .
to go ahead .
on too it , i guess
do n't know
do n't think that 's right
on the other hand , but there 's a lot of advantages to it .
by using it
of course , and you have some savings in terms of money taxpayer keeping people in jail or not .
that 's what 's happening here .
and the rates of repeat offenders turnover doing it again
and it 's like that
but there is not a whole lot you can do about it , because there is only so many jails you can build
and it gets to be a big problem .
to go ahead .
in dealing with who got lethal injection do n't
a lot of
and they get off
and do n't know ,
just because , like , before we said they do n't have enough room in the jails there 's a lot of incentive for them to be let early out
, do n't know
think that may solve a lot of that
maybe not
, but do n't know
kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty .
you in
what do you do ?
but do n't know
it 's an interesting issue .
ca n't give you figures
is that right ?
things about that
mess n't around very much
repealed , as easily as
they said , and then
you do n't have to go .
and then they took him back .
it just seemed
you have two , and then
you 've serial killers that did n't even ever get back when the death sentence .
do n't know
is trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it
it or is a life sentence ?
does n't
the firing
so think about the only one
how do you feel about it ?
do n't see any problem with testing for random drugs
myself , is almost in favor of it .
went through a , drug standard testing thing and before
is that
and that kind of thing , the almost goodness of character
where do you work ?
a policy for
if make they an offer , then .
on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem
and that happens definitely .
the drug tests they
but there 's always
and that is something to be aware of .
is another thing .
they sensitive that
going to do about what that
they did n't catch that
or they else would
is sure they screen for just a few particular types
with you
about five thousand drugs
do n't know
electrical
test before you before you
, did the drug testing thing after that
through the general battery of all their tests
then , and they give you essentially the offer
'll at they and then
there are so
actually is
probably .
what happens if you were fail ?
they give you chance or two more chances one more
that 's a good question .
give you one more chance
they give you a chance to explain yourself and give you then maybe another chance to go through it probably .
accurate that once again , but not
people do fail
you working anywhere right now
in may be just about to finish my master 's
is also a doctoral student down there
they did basically , and the exact same thing .
drug at the same time
we went through kind of an identical process .
they do test right now , at work , too , you ?
drug while you 're on the job
think the unwritten rule is expect it ,
but they do n't do it .
that 's good i guess .
do n't know
of parties since that time a
while have seen and some people who work there
and that 's the kind of thing that would definitely come up .
but
they do n't really do that .
that they said it is
is here
how do you feel about public schools ?
our public schools poor , i feel really
but we 're
but the system does n't allow for the corrections .
about how you ?
that is interesting .
a young boy and one when she was there had .
she and quite a bit complained about their school system there .
ca n't really say much about the schools up here
really do n't come
the schools down
they are pretty good .
that 's great .
known , but in a lot of rural areas they are not that good
the schools there terrible just
feel we 're behind way
have a son who are in the fourth grade
and they have taken up just now division .
that 's slow .
to the store
several areas that we 're really , really slow in just
n't blame as the teachers
is wrong to cause
there is not enough money in the school system for one thing .
have , they do not use it wisely
certainly and that 's a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis .
but do n't think they have the authority to command the attention of the children
two kids in that class on constantly keep the class in an uproar and you 're when it and not
is that
go there
quite a few black people up there probably
we 're from the county they marched in .
is that right ?
and there are very , very few blacks .
because it 's not a problem .
whatever prejudice or or
, but then
but especially in the inner city
there is
.
a special very well developed program at the school education
and you ca n't put all the children in special education .
that 's right ,
you ca n't do that .
and was fantastic
consider myself really very , very lucky
but your teacher have control .
was too
but , you 're right .
you also have taken something away from the discipline
it 's really because if we could afford it , my son would be in private school of mine a concern .
we can afford it just not .
was going to ask you if that was an option
you want to go first
you can start .
do we think about a judge making the decision ?
and do n't really agree with that
thinks the trial by jury is having a unanimous decision rather better than have one person be responsible
in every case , every time
you know
is this topic
there 's no way .
we could n't survive in a system without a jury trial .
one man , one woman can never
that 's it .
every person have their opinions
and that 's why jury selection often is very difficult .
the other thing too
they were saying what new ways could it , change .
a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal
by jury especially if a person and a trial
it is beyond a reasonable doubt .
all these things
we have gone through this over and over again .
they should n't allow an appeal .
and it can go on for ten , twenty , years .
think this is a little ridiculous
benefited from that
that 's right .
i work for
is serious
today in the criminal system
bargaining plea is a different story .
's plea bargaining something completely different .
speeds or at least prevents trials actually up .
known
are saying
do n't know how it works exactly
but they get
the jails full of people
because they know they can get away with it is
are saying
that a lot of states do n't have capital punishment .
and think they should
.
dead to rights
just think they have taken a life
and they should pay for it with their life .
was when you 're saying as far as the appeal
we have the case , just
before his sentencing was up
was so
he for cocaine possession and got out of jail two days later .
but that was absurd .
there were on that long for a month sentence six
and do n't know
what would you do to change it ?
appeal procedure is the only thing
and having the judge sentence , that
there 's no way that could work .
do n't agree with that at all
person would have .
there is no possible way that you could feel good about yourself .
if you have to do something like that , days after days .
no one would want the job .
not really .
said and everyone had their opinions about every case
you think people should have
to a trial by jury
there were witnesses ?
that you ca n't remove
and there are still
when you 're with a big company or a big organization ,
and , is the pay
in to what 's going on
is the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages anybody could get in dealing with a large company
maybe and that is probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do .
about benefits
what you sort of benefits would like to get from a big company .
about medical benefits
his medical benefits so and excellent so
that 's really great .
i work for a bank
me know really about anything that 's going on
do n't know it until the hour next
we know of all and
we are changing departments .
we are changing policies .
to be changing doing other kinds of things
right there .
are pretty much , as far as
but like to know what 's going on , and what 's happening
to be a better and more effective employee if
i work for the government
i work for
, there are lots of things that we do n't get told
but there are basically lots of things that we should know about projects .
is an engineering
and worked in the same lab with a guy
projects for two years
and , we should have
are we now
for two years we did n't .
all and which was kind of interesting .
that is interesting .
tolerate if a lot of problems
or a hard time getting out to the people who must know the word
you if you 're not part of the program and might not get told for months
but regard to most big benefits organizations have decent benefits like retirement and that sort of thing .
engineers and as they get older , to most companies .
and it is
it windows out
is getting more money
, and is getting more responsibility
are doing this
gets but as the branches
and off fall soon .
have fallen twice off in the private sector
can get up , and
known
and he wants
and is now kind of open
and he is interested in different three areas basically .
but it is difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or advise him or anything like that .
he need to do his own course of investigation and see because who knows what 's going to happen in another thirty years .
and it becomes pretty critical in thirty years .
he 's not ready to retire
but his company 's , closing up .
the and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff working on what is stuff and all
and he 's not ready to retire .
may
you do n't feel your privacy
not really .
that 's not really invading my privacy .
my privacy by
wants to sell you this or that
and it 's real hard to tell them you 're not interested .
or you do tell them you 're not interested
and that aggravates me .
do n't know you could call
but that does n't work .
it does n't ?
any type of contest or anything
your phone number on there
on to another company
just the newspapers , they or .
even the newspapers called here .
one more time
during regular hours
they have a special department ,
they 'll take your numbers out of their lists .
every month and .
a called on each number you 've and when you have more than one phone number get .
me ask you about this
been kind of lately concerning me
they are a department store .
visit a store there
she bought such and such amount of merchandise over worth two hundred dollars of merchandise
and is apparently someone used her social security number
and their mother 's maiden name you can
mail order
and she could prove it was n't her since .
if it were some coming would
they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature
and they 'll have to eat the charge , if they ca n't provide a signature .
because she wo n't .
we got
what happened ,
did n't
think it was mostly a mistake
any one of which were sort of understandable at the time .
but think it was the wrong thing to do probably on
about how you ?
was just when it ended in high school
was in the last lottery
was what was it over by then and
have never really there
it seems like just because we did n't really do anything when we went over .
that was over there ,
it was just kind of a not so much holiday , and for some of them
is that
they just kind of lived in the woods out but
now and then , they 'd ever and go and shoot their rifles
they 'd come back , and then
but that they were n't .
it is funny .
it actually was almost a personal struggle among these three , and when
you 'd have to call them great men in some sense
they are all leaders certainly
pretty behind each one of them
back like that was
brought a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight
but do n't think you can just fight just anywhere in order to call the bully out and beat him
they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line , beat them , and they would n't come forward .
and we were wrong .
said each decision that was made as being understandable
was n't
the other wars seemed like a valiant war .
they seemed like a valiant thing .
who were good .
who were bad .
, it is if you known
and to who are good who is bad
it is ambivalent ,
what about the domestic effects
maybe the most important effect it had make it possible and even popular to criticize the government
it is now dying ,
may this stuff desert storm
but is n't really do
i concentrate on weekly magazines
with as much information detail as you 'd like
have the time to become a student in every article really
like the weekly magazines because it gives me of what the high points
many times the local news but .
that 's right .
you 're very close actually .
almost a community bedroom for
things like
really sufficient dose of news that way and .
a lot of my information comes from several sources .
it is
them of being too liberal and too conservative and .
and always while there is an inherent filtering process .
that 's potential indication of balance .
and generally really do
time magazine
going through various sections of the articles and the front section
only the things up there
you did use to live around here ?
know exactly where is that
the mercury actually is a pretty good newspaper
a lot of the articles there and .
but the thing you referred to other that sounds really interesting to me always be called span c .
we have both c spans here .
both ?
the whole thing was run on that
they have the , parliament 's question
never say
that would have been interesting .
it ,
think that 's always fascinating
and everybody was making noise in the background .
but it 's the prime minister usually ?
major .
and said it 's parliament
so ca n't wait
discovered the prime minister 's question
have seen
kind of an informal kind of situation , is
my wife and looks at
all those people counting on me to have my wife
we do n't really have a formal budgeting situation .
just got in my inertia
decided not to pursue it just
what 's your budget situation ?
of different situations a
my current one been the most successful
that left me with three teenagers and .
that kind of situation is actually
it 's certainly .
was the credit cards all but at any rate
did n't send them back
.
put away just
it was
could go use it if
mostly we spent but just cash .
and if we did n't have it , we did n't spend it absolutely
my parents came through the depression .
is not sure how old
my parents too
thirties ,
my mother and spent on herself or on the house ever hardly anything .
and that 's
a person in that aspect
did n't spend any money for
, meanwhile , now have
ever and and not have to spend any money on interest .
that 's good .
and that 's
still do n't buy it and if
we got a monster bill coming in .
but we have also
as it goes we and pay off .
is now my credit cards and
so we never really get .
almost all my purchasing on credit cards
so have enough of a cushion in the bank
we are doing that .
pieces in the family room and new carpet two new
we just have been spending , spending , spending .
done anything for a long time
we do n't have that .
it 's time for you then to do these things .
it 's about time that we did that .
the terrible part about it
it all and still looks pretty good to me .
why
why .
but too late ,
we 'll never find out that .
this is so funny .
is that
you have difficulty spending money
certain things do really need to be done .
do n't spend much that money
care of the kids when they were
and they got through school .
and that were the major decade of expenses .
just as far as any formal budgeting we 've been very fortunate , but apparently
eat , we go out to eat when .
we 've never really to program for that money or make .
had an awful lot of incidents regarding child care
but , that 's about the extent of it .
and they do n't pay very much
and that 's a terrible kind of thing
and do n't think my children have been subject to that ever
but my wife did n't work
and so we did n't really have that much exposure to it .
is a working mother
have children three
have different various alternatives , child care arrangements
like most working mothers and is not really defensive about it
work out of the home
, my kids raised well children
my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities .
it 's a problem .
think , but as the real problem is the low pay child facilities
that 's all they can afford .
as they got older , and then they went to schools
and they were
a lot of neat things to
that is interesting .
but we really did pay a fortune truly .
about a week for children two hundred dollars five one
ace hero to support professional just one job
as is my husband .
felt very good about working and
actually is a pediatrician
some wonderful opportunities child care out there for children
for things you are supposed to look
not all of us
for things you are supposed to look
is an engineering
's real important that you have a place , first of all parents who have a lot of input into and they 're always welcome
we have a really wonderful arrangement , and
actually be with the university
and they have a wonderful program that started at age three
away from a block
they have things like gardens and lots of pets
and they have a teacher four to one student ratio .
most of the teachers has degrees .
five hundred dollars a week
that is incredible .
it was incredible actually .
but it was good .
there were two children at that time
they were in special programs and
each one was a little over a week two hundred and
then , a addition and in paid .
they really have some great opportunities .
they do sometimes put them in fairly low paying situations .
somebody will have a job at a week to get off welfare three hundred
that 's a good starting wage and
three hundred dollars a week but do n't go on child care very far .
my youngest child 's eight .
something like .
earlier the comment but .
there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences .
a certain market
as a pediatrician , is one of the things we 've been real the infections .
probably you 're in the same situation that we 're in
having to provide child care
our kids grown up
we do n't have any grandchildren yet .
your children
so they are getting there .
they 're going to be getting there .
there is no prospects right away for anything to happen .
.
have five children
and she is a teacher
what she does teaches at
they let her and bring in little her daughter for free .
but she works part-time just .
she work
and it 's just tearing her apart .
the baby and just scream .
and she just scream .
even if she knows
they are not yet even there .
it 's hard .
her mother and stay home
live with us as orange county are really expensive and .
live with us
we see this cute little baby all the time
and child care
and here , she was a provider
but there is much only one person can do so .
she said it is so awful .
her child in
is sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere
but it 's very difficult really
when your kids were growing up
the first ten or twelve years
and then after
then have one job
supposed to be good recommended person from the church
knew and
two kids of
could n't stand how she was taking of my child care
her children of all were first sick all the time .
so when my son stayed over there , he got sick .
he got sick ,
same thing that her kids had ?
was saying he is sick
and she goes , he has the same thing that all my kids have .
that 's what he got .
, goes ,
's , but then what happened
so she said she 'll keep him home
and he 'll probably just sleep anyway .
you know , what
as soon as he went there , the teacher took look at him one
he up again and
and they put him in the nurse 's office .
guess so
called her
they said he is sick and .
she was n't home .
her kids were all sick
but she was n't home .
why she did n't
she did n't do that .
leave work
what was he at school there still and out found .
and they were calling me
said they and
and kept thinking that she was going to pick up because she lives only two blocks away from the school him
get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff
and he had a hundred and four fever .
not to at school and everything
was
job
and stayed home for
can kind of adjust a little bit better my time
a little more flexibility
you can come and go .
had any really very good experience with child care
of good women who often would get them to come a
i guess , you start
drug random
have all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it
about what you ?
at all
, is not
a few years after
do n't know
when there are immediate threat to life and limb should somebody be under the influence of drugs 'd be willing to support
for example
would n't want them to be on drugs
in that regard , where it is not
is that mine .
going back
it 's not ,
the constitution does n't apply .
but it seems to me that it should still .
our company is doing it because they are a government contractor .
are some form of program drug and so
so it 's the government that is to a certain extent mandating it ?
our company taken that and gone all the way
pick out the people who have some sort of indication of possible usage drug because that would if they were n't offend them
and make it even all
and ,
then
so it 's
you do n't know when
everyone in the company will within three years
software all day and .
no threatened capabilities life in my job
and ,
are
and need to be a line drawn reasonable and proper somewhere
.
there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results .
or should n't say high
several percent
of levels of in terms of drugs tests a
it is not quite
but it is fairly simple .
of a coarse kind of test .
coarse kind of testing
now let me .
this is not a condition of employment obviously so that you subject yourself to this .
they did before they did it with everybody that three or four years .
coming in you do n't know
of anything the
is not
did about the last thing
on another bedroom on his house to
the whole thing ?
that was
the framing and all did ?
we were n't sure how to do that
has my last big project
is that
did all the roofing
we did n't just do any of the work sheetrock wall
because and is that it
we did n't know a thing about of that any
have n't done that
it looked very hard to do
did n't
so , we left it to somebody who do for a living it .
think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy
probably
we 'd never and done it
we just so left it alone .
i guess ,
my vast experience of home owner 's knowledge is not so very much .
it is , the house for my parents around
in new square footage
or was
it was new brand .
brand new
and we turned it into part of the house
and you know how to do the framing
my dad know how to do most of it .
of books a
then he just and started doing it .
do n't know
he did all the flooring himself .
the whole floor
started with the walls and the roof
it is
drive to park another car
do you build on slabs down there
did it or
it is
on the piers ?
you have
or you did them yourself ?
we did ourselves those
forms in
completely did myself
have done one ,
helped one of those before
but we did n't do that way .
designed it from scratch
did a pretty good job .
those nice
they are
you can always tear stuff out and redo it .
that 's not near , like building a house or anything
those nice
especially when you get done , you 've got something .
, do n't know
like
have a barbecue
that sounds nice .
done by yourself all
had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
support by four posts with four
and then just the rest of i it did .
a friend contractor helped me with some of the work foundation
it was about four or five hundred square feet .
that the same size as the addition
that 's a good deck size .
so .
it 's not that expensive .
think it cost three dollars me a square foot and no less than that
me about five hundred dollars , six hundred dollars
that 's good .
that 's not bad at all .
as to the fact that 's how much wood
but even in little this town , it 's not cheap at all .
was
it was
it 's probably more there .
it probably come .
probably do it .
is not sure
see when i drive through that area , that 's all
it is nothing but woods down here .
was a kid
, but do n't know
we 're a town college
so that does n't help us out any .
gas , is a dollar a gallon twelve
that is probably about what you are paying so
that 's a lot easier .
you 've got something going all the time .
historically is really only the kinds of things
really do n't think they can do much of anything to change really so
what do you think ?
do n't think so
you wonder had the jury be a different group
with stuff like that force too much
apparently each and every one of those blows but then
and the other two guys sat in the car
that 's bad .
and they did n't get beat up .
and they 're going to rebuild
and it 'll be even better .
thought
is going to come in and to invest in that area ?
that 's right .
they 're going to suffer only .
you might be able to use it for a test bombing site and even .
they 're going to suffer only .
defeat with their looting and violence
saw all the same thing on the tape
everybody is saying this is going to be a new era
the average person suspicions confirmed .
they are a bunch of animals .
you 're going to lose everything .
known
it 's ridiculous really .
is interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing
those deaths
no tears .
a number of them but .
and in the street
or
no one would
is too
had seen for anything my car
and say
and do n't think like that
is a government employee
you do work in what section of the government ?
b the
that is interesting .
and he wanted another collection a year later .
this is so and my seventh call .
.
you say you have some strong feelings about the issue and ?
as far as
think we simply must start accepting everybody in the world
there 's just not going to be room for all of us .
we do n't have now jobs .
our doors at that time
you 're
is one of the unemployed right now
was a analysis systems and programmer for an oil company
but they have two thousand applications .
a lot of foreigners doing my line of work here
and are not perfectly happy about not having a job of course
how do you feel ?
is a little bit ambivalent
is one of the problems with policy immigration like any other political problem
the same way with issues of race and things like .
two the government use policies
three actually
is one
some brain
they 'd like to be able to get the top people in any field
and so they can find almost always room for someone like that .
and it has strong support from the , powerful people in that area
do n't think the politicians would tell you that
think and you 're right in both cases
think it 's pretty important right there probably and
think they are a very difficult group to integrate into society
they are jobs , places and to find for very difficult group .
in causing the problem in that they are pretty miserable
actually feel that if we accepted these people we would have the total population here almost eventually
and it would have nothing to do with political situations .
it would have to do with poverty .
about it
the two of them and together .
it 's just as well ,
but there are some differences in the immigrants , that we 're getting now .
particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
, they do n't bother to learn our language
feel really strongly
the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff
so they 've actually one for the regular trash , one for the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers .
you do not separate the bottles and cans
on the truck that
,
and one guy come around with it all .
and think they are running out of
the sanitary landfill is running out .
known
landfill space is still very hard to come by and , in fact despite all of our open space out here
you 've got a lot of nothing out there ,
a regulation about it but if somebody can make .
that 's pretty trash upscale situation .
do n't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques getting rid of the heavy metals
have actually
was in graduate school
think and in fact
of things the
think it should go to the heart of the matter , though , and say , guy ,
five pounds of
have every week but more than that
think they 'd be very careful
think that 's a wonderful idea
is that it would speak directly to the space needs and the landfill more if you did it by volume rather than by weight
limiting the volume and probably is a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight .
of my youth the good
to stretch out
and , like to run
like to run , to get up my heartbeat
like to run about two and a half miles
i kind of think it 's a lot of work and
think it 's a lot of work , but
the amount of
and you 're going to get sick .
are pretty bad about that
's lazy
,
need start running
and are going to try and do this summer that
never have time
always put off
get back it is by late at night
is getting a gut here
got to get back
two years ago started having trouble with my knee
figured it 'll go away
had to reduce my program
need get back instead of running
ca n't run
is such a terrible swimmer
start not doing anything
got a real problem in that regard so
doing it
it , i guess
want to get in shape
then it wo n't be as much of a chore to me if
it 's always a chore .
is going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense
is going to blow me away
that 's the same way ,
got too much weight on right now
need lose twenty at least ,
but it 's just .
are doing a lot of traveling
and it creates a problem when you 're on the road .
what other programs other than running ?
you ever done had anything at all ?
have
a right club here to
got kind of expensive to renew
that was a little bit too much money .
what club with
is
what club was with you ?
you are so
it is plaza .
there is something a holiday spa down on street k there .
and that 's pretty good .
but evening time it get pretty busy .
generally can get in and get a program , but
got a problem and ever since
and so do n't really want to back , off on it
it 's something ,
is young ,
should get started getting into shape
, do n't want to
it 's going to be too late to do it at .
when you 're young , you can
you can recover and .
do
do n't know
have been pretty successful with that
up to do just that
what ?
they things
have done some other things , too ,
have done both
of times
we 've been fairly successful with those .
that is a kind of low risk sort of project
a good way
have a , really nice desk
and it turned out to be a nice desk .
a kit
is
still have cut
but it was fun .
my own deck and things like that
have definitely and
ca n't say , but them
in handy at the most unusual times
and that 's
'll
twice a
, do n't know
n't all because he was tell me
they have plastic parts and stuff .
the ones that what ?
that dial .
closely never even
how strong is it ?
a tool as
good a set of bits 's probably going to run so
and if you 're going to use for a lifetime .
because ,
them myself they wo n't last
they really get hot
they and awhile .
and that wears a bit down .
will take pretty fast and the edge off a cheap bit
cut by oak before eight some one
that fun was .
big solid pieces of oak tough just
that was with a circular saw .
this is going to be fun ?
mine on
all my blades and now .
really can make you sick too
