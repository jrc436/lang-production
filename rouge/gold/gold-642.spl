i guess you 're probably in the same situation we 're in . 
we 're kind of past having to provide child care . 
our kids are grown up . 
we do n't have any grandchildren yet . 
how old are your children ? 
so they 're getting there . 
they 're going to be getting there . 
there 's no prospects right away for anything to happen . 
i see . 
i have five children . 
and she 's a teacher 
and what she does is she , teaches at a preschool . 
and they let her bring her little daughter in for free . 
but she just works part-time . 
and she has to work full-time 
and it 's just tearing her apart . 
and the baby just screams . 
and she just screams . 
even if she knows that they 're fixing to get ready to go over there . 
they 're not even there yet . 
it 's hard . 
and her mother stays home 
and they live with us as orange county is really expensive . 
they live with us 
and so , of course , we love it . because we get to see this cute little baby all the time . 
she used to work in the preschool and child care 
and , here she was a provider 
but there 's only so much one person can do . 
she said it 's so awful . 
she said she 'll never put her child in a preschool . 
i 'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere . 
but it 's really very difficult 
what did you do when your kids were growing up ? 
the first ten or twelve years , i stayed home . 
and then after that i went to work . 
then i had one job 
supposed to be good recommended person from the church 
and i knew her personally . 
she had two kids of her own and everything . 
but i quit my job because i could n't stand how she was taking care of my child . 
first of all her children were sick all the time . 
so when my son stayed over there , he got sick . 
he got sick , 
same thing that her kids had ? 
that day i was saying he 's sick . 
and she goes , he has the same thing that all my kids have . 
that 's what he got . 
goes , , 
but then what happened is , i said , he just threw up 
so she said she 'll keep him home 
and he 'll probably just sleep anyway . 
you know , what 
as soon as he went there , the teacher took one look at him 
and he threw up again 
and they put him in the nurse 's office . 
guess so , 
called her 
and they said that he 's sick . 
she was n't home . 
all her kids were sick 
but she was n't home . 
why did n't she keep him home with her ? 
she did n't do that . 
and i had to leave work . 
and i found out he was still there at school . 
and they were calling me 
and they said somebody 's got to pick him up . 
and i kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives two blocks away from the school . 
i was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff . 
and he had a hundred and four fever . 
they could n't give him anything because they 're not allowed to at school and everything . 
i was so furious . 
i quit that job 
and i stayed home for awhile longer . 
then i went and got a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better . 
a little more flexibility . 
you can come and go . 
but i have n't had any really very good experience with child care . 
when our kids were small we had a couple of good women who would often get them to come to the house .
