# lang-production

This project is research code focused on using the jACT-R library (http://jact-r.org/), to model grammatical encoding, the process of 
combining words into sentences. In particular, the goal was to investigate the relationship between how incrementally sentences are 
constructed and how that related to memory capacity. Moreover, this project is one of the first efforts to combine concrete linguistic
representations and make specific claims about memory.

This project is not necessarily designed for public use, but to document the methods used in that research. To setup, please first have
jACT-R running. Models are generated programmatically by learning the vocabulary and associated types from a corpus, so an annotated
corpus (such as Switchboard) is needed. This project is also dependent on the executors project (https://github.com/jrc436/executors).
