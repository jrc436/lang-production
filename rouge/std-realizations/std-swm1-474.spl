it 's apt probably that 's your call because we just got through watching reasonable doubts at this time
be upon a felony third conviction
, too
, on the steps , that day mandatory , execution summary
think that person is beyond rehabilitation
and he should be taken out .
almost all people
they just get old too .
have the trouble with the way
, on a little bit more fair manner
said , very often
, believe it to be and a true very axiom
would rather be white , rich and black and innocent than guilty so
they will kill you .
and if it 's two hundred hours of community service .
you do n't hear too much of those cases .
we 're the majority ,
whatever the hell we want to do
that 's right .
and you 're the minority
and you 're
the on the wall there 's handwriting , is n't it ?
it sure is .
but that 's another issue altogether .
think that 's ten years on death row cruel and unusual punishment
as it is right now our judicial system
is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution
was
and once they found guilty you judge said he 's guilty ,
kill him .
there was some people that have a problem with that .
and he 'll say guy did not me it .
lie for him
people
it 's a strange thing ,
they but
that guy at
they convicted him .
he was too far away when it happened .
they were n't dope dealers ,
of security sense a very high
and these were really responsible people .
and they convicted this guy because somebody says , he looks like the right guy .
to me the
big lips , flat nose ,
that was him .
