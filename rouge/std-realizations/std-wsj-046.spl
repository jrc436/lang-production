how do you keep up with current events usually ?
radio from news and from a news magazine once a week
do you ,
read the newspaper
and try to catch one of the morning talk shows ,
so try to catch that , if nothing else
that 's true ,
that the news coverage
living in a kind of small town
excellent local coverage
the national news
a real good job and .
have so
about how you ?
have an opportunity to hear just the facts
seems to be more and more of it ,
the void come naturally with both presentations radio and television presentations
they could pass on to us factual more information , but
is going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions
do n't really need their help to do that
we 're certainly in agreement there .
or they have more over that same frame time to do
which answer that is
you do watch that ?
, used to
maybe n't anymore , but once or twice a year
just do n't ever since and watch
we have the same reaction whether we came
they really , was
do n't
do n't know if you 're familiar with him or not so
not really ,
just his kind of
but never got to see his actual nightly news
and he did a pretty good job .
on the nightly news , but now , he goes into his commentary
to get into the problem with him
frequently with his commentaries
they reported the facts
all they can offer is an opinion anymore .
what did you think of the news coverage of the war ?
almost felt like it was too much
of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening , a
spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst ,
a lot was going
your prior experience with
try to guess where we are going
, do you look at
have taken them all for a year at one
in giving anything a chance .
keep coming back to that one , but
so , is that kind of my favorite .
it is primarily a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports .
that sounds good
if you were short on time , you could
it 's too one
all we have to find in the interest of efficiency ,
most of my reading in the bathroom and .
is going to spend in there
it seems to fit nicely and , just so .
we got an introductory subscription , for
prior to that were all we got
so , we decided to try to bring in a little bit one that were better for us .
to broaden your horizons
it ca n't hurt , .
ca n't hurt anytime
try to catch because it is another example , it
they show you just the words , and the facts
and they do n't offer any commentary ,
a quick chance up during the day
because we do n't listen to the radio at work at all .
go without hearing anything the whole day
's with you ,
is talking fingers , sometimes
you do have that ?
you have different numbers that you can dial , telephone
dial and then in an code access
what topic to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a update soap opera
that can give you current updates news , current updates weather , things like that
and it is offered through the local phone company free of charge .
that so , is that .
it does sound very interesting ,
it gives a wide variety of things you can call and find you
our phone company out here will get to around , offering something like that maybe .
so , that is something you might keep your eyes open for ,
on throughout the country
