i pay a good deal of taxes because i make a fair amount of money , 
and the taxes that i pay as a general statement , i feel i get my money 's worth for . 
i guess i am sure that i feel that , in general , though the allocation of the taxes in certain areas , is n't correct . 
i 'm sure that probably every person in this country would agree with you on that . because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go . 
there 's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there , 
and i 'm not really sure that we 've gotten our money 's worth there regardless of the outcome of the desert shield situations . 
i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military off and on over the years of being called back and things of that nature , i 've found that there 's an extraordinary amount of waste . 
i take that as a given in any military operation 
no argument here . 
i do n't know what other foe that would be , 
but i 'm just getting nervous again , now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area . 
of course a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war , 
and they used up two thousand of them in the war , 
let 's see , 
i should imagine that , that would be to keep it at those levels that were originally appropriated when the soviet threat was perceived as being a greater one . 
i do n't think there 's very much of a threat there today . 
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in their territory over there , and who 's controlling them , 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
i do n't know what amount of , our hardware would stop some fanatic from doing anything that would be irrational . 
of course now , we used up twenty per cent of that inventory , in a matter of just a few weeks , 
and , a big percentage of that was expended , as well , 
what is the name of that ? 
and a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also . 
and that was an area that i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we 're taxed for , 
in the area of defense , 
or perhaps we have paid too much there , 
i do n't know , 
and it 's a cliche , 
but i see it myself , 
i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways . 
no doubt . 
i do n't know , 
i 'm familiar with some upbeat school areas , 
so i do n't totally agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there , 
basically , what it does , is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts , that come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state , that are not so affluent . 
they do n't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system , 
or is it all funded out of local taxes ? 
then we had a number of education reforms , that the legislature said , we got to do this , 
we got to do this , 
we got to do this , 
but , they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it , 
and they dumped it all on the local school districts . 
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now . 
so what ended up happening was a shift . 
do you mean a complete reversal ? 
because they ca n't raise that money in those poorer districts , 
complete . 
it 's all shifted to local districts , 
and now , even the money that 's been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state . 
that 's right , 
and i have no problem , with a certain minimum level , that 's a standard that everybody ought to be able to have , 
i see what you 're saying . 
by that i mean , i 'm a product myself , 
so did i . 
my masters , anyway . 
but when i look at it to me it does n't really make any difference . 
it was a marvelous opportunity that i could n't have done , 
that 's right . 
i do n't even know if you have to perform community service , 
at least what i read , is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their , budget . 
to me it does n't sound like a lot of money , 
i do n't know what that would be . 
they had to raise community college taxes here , a few years ago . 
and , the states now do n't have enough money 
so they must charge fees . 
i 'm not too sure of that reasoning . 
but i guess i do n't know whether i pay too much taxes . 
people pay , a great deal in taxes , 
i can believe that . 
it costs me money to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax a sales tax which is getting to quite high levels , 
i 'm not sure that i 'm not up fairly close to that . 
you really think so ? 
i really do . 
i feel that in the last ten years my taxes have gone up , 
they have n't gone down . 
i pay quite a bit more taxes 
everybody is . 
what they 've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase . to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious . 
this has been really interesting , 
and i 've enjoyed our talk . 
i guess i just push something here . 
push one again , 
we just say 
and that 's it . 
just hang up . 
don , good talking with you . 
nice talking with you , too .
