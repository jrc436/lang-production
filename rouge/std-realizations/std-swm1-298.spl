'll start off first
absolutely no problem with
an awful lot of time traveling on the job
particularly airline and
've been hearing
so do n't really have a problem with it
n't either
do n't work ,
home with my children
but my husband works
and they do have that at his place of employment
and neither of us have a problem with it .
you just do n't
there have been so many ,
probably just for that 's going on .
's supervisor of personnel safety for the world 's company largest paint ,
even in our field and we have
we do , and not at the present time ,
're pushing towards that and
they should n't have a problem with it
have and then if to know , because is we talking major liabilities
but with other employees
doctors and airline pilots
something 's going to happen
and they 're showing it with aids ,
they ought to start doing something with the drugs .
so really have no problem with it
it 's unfortunate everyone does n't have .
it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that ,
and not
but those kind of i things 'd like to know myself .
have a lot of dental work done
the last dentist did n't and use even gloves at all ,
so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me .
if that 's the way
was a dentist
you would think so .
and worked for a dentist
you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that
and it 's real , real dangerous .
would think ,
me crazy
's been doing
do n't know
they had it for several years
have a lot of problems associated with it , , and
and it sounded very positive .
and think it 's great
would encourage it
're pushing our company towards that
from their employer and friends and family and things
too many people just dying
what the crime is like
but the crime rate is here
ours is changing .
ours is changing ,
it 's increasing .
live in a very nice suburb
and it 's unbelievable what 's going on and the selling of drugs .
it 's just too loose .
it 's free too .
have very little two children , under two
got a piece of paper from my husband 's office and ,
like a sticker
