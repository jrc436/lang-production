are you on any kind of regular exercise plan ? 
step classes ? 
what 's that ? 
it 's a new form i think , 
it 's like low impact aerobics 
instead of hopping and jumping you just step 
you have a step 
and you literally step up on the step and move your arms , 
it 's new , 
it 's fun . 
i probably could n't do that because of my knee . 
bad knee . 
every once in a while i play tennis , 
i 'm not too great at it 
but i try to play , . 
i 've kind of gotten out of the habit myself , 
right now i 'm on two teams 
so it 's four nights a week . 
so i enjoy it 
instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there , i went and bought a weight bench , and do n't ever hardly use it . 
i need to make myself do that . 
i 'm about to graduate from college 
and so this past couple months have been really hectic 
so i have n't really gone , 
and i 've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out 
what school you going to ? 
but 
is that lifting weights ? 
it 's isolated movements for certain muscles groups , 
you can do it with weights if you wanted to 
but you leave out of there 
usually the next morning , if you have n't done it in a while , you wake up the next morning you 're , 
what did i do to myself 
i know i 'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape , 
i feel like i 'm out of shape 
but i feel guilty for not going , because i 'm so used to going for three or four years now . 
i , stayed in pretty good shape during school . 
i played baseball , all the way through 
and working out six hours a day , usually six or seven days a week that kind of , kept us all in pretty good shape , . 
but ever since i got out of school just jumped right into the job 
and , i guess the job that i 'm in it 's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule . 
because i work some weird hours and do some traveling . 
i do n't know if your campus was anything like ours , 
but our parking lot 's in one end of the campus 
and the buildings are all at the other end , 
i did n't have much of a problem 
so , it 's pretty small . 
but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant . 
i live on the second story apartments 
so i walk up and down stairs all day long , 
we 've got a one story house now 
that 's enough . 
that 's , fairly regular . 
that 's one of the exercise , now . 
i , would like to start running . 
i 've never been much of a runner 
but i want to start , 
i want to run 
but i do n't know if i 'll be able to do it . 
just , because you do n't like to or because you wo n't be able to . 
, i 'm afraid i wo n't be able to . 
if you do aerobics you should n't have any problem running . 
i hope not . , 
we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough . 
i do n't even own a bike , 
i think the last time i was on a bike , 
i do n't know , 
i 'd be , afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike . 
you ca n't forget how to ride a bike . 
i 'm trying to think of other things that i do that will be considered exercise , , 
there are things i should do . 
i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred , 
one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics 
and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting . 
we had it for course credit , 
but still it was pretty high impact stuff , . 
definitely are tough classes . 
most of the guys were all in one class 
so she 'd kind of lay it on occasionally . 
wake up . 
you have bands , 
i do n't know , if you 've seen them , 
they 're weird . 
i think my wife has some . 
they 're just made of different kinds of rubber , 
or sand even some of them , 
so i guess it would n't be sand . 
i know there 's purple , gray , and green . 
and some of them are real short 
and they 're the ones that are the tough ones to use . 
but those classes i enjoy . 
i think with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that 's fun . 
if you do n't have one that 's fun , and not acting like she 's enjoying what she 's doing , the class is not going to get out what they should get out of the class . 
are you going to get into instructing ? 
what are you studying ? 
i 'm an interior design major , . 
not in the , aerobic instructor type field . 
i could never do that , . 
i 'd rather just be the student , . 
and occasionally i do the weights at the health club but low weights just ... 
they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups , with those things 
i do n't know 
i just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized machines , 
and you set a speed on it and the weight 
and it makes you do it . 
if you 're going too slow it will say , my grandmother could do this faster than you . and stuff like , a turtle goes faster 
and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you . 
a little negative reinforcement there while you 're going . 
so do stuff like that 
but just i 've never used those machines 
i just use the regular machines and the free weights like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights . 
that 's where i 'm really starting to get noticeable , 
i 'm just getting real soft in the middle . 
i think that 's number one problem with everyone . 
i have n't really started to put on a lot of weight 
i guess i probably put on about nine or ten pounds , since i stopped playing , which was about four years ago . 
but i just notice myself just real soft 
but i keep saying i intend to get back into it . 
i guess at that point it would turn into a task , , 
i do n't consider it fun doing that , 
i plan on getting back , once i graduate next weekend . 
next weekend ? 
next weekend . 
one week , . 
then i plan to get right back into it . 
it does a lot for you i think . 
makes you feel a lot better . 
there 's no question the end result is great 
when i was playing ball we could run all day and not be tired . 
and you feel so much better , about yourself . 
just that you do n't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner , . 
i still do n't , 
but . that 's a problem . 
thank you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
you too .
