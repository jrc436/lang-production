did you watch the bulls this morning ? 
you know what , 
i watched a little bit of the bulls game 
and i had to leave . 
in fact i think the bulls were ahead when i left . 
who won the game ? 
they won by two points . 
is that right ? 
they were behind as they headed into each quarter 
and then they came back in the second half 
and at the end , i think they looked like they were closing it out 
and i think the bulls won by two . 
do n't they have the best record now ? 
i think they do , as a matter of fact . 
they looked real good 
they do , 
they 're balancing their attack 
i know , 
i saw the second half of the game last night 
and they were impressive . 
they look good . 
that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him . 
good move . 
he 's really worked out well . 
the warriors have got a team , 
and i think that will be real interesting to see what they can do . 
they 're ahead , 
and i do n't know , 
in the east , i do n't know , 
i have n't kept up with any of the other teams . 
they 've had a hard time . 
but just this whole year has been just disastrous for them 
and i think they 're going for an all time record of how many losses in a row they can , pull out . 
it 's unbelievable . 
not a whole lot , 
you find them to be pretty loyal with the local teams . 
it 's true , 
really is n't , 
is it ? 
so it 's not something you 'd drive , 
and they have got a great club . 
they 've done a good job . 
of course , drafting a franchise like him certainly , 
that always makes a big difference . 
i think that 's the way it works now in basketball . 
and i used to think that one player really does n't make a club , 
but it really does . 
you get somebody like magic 
and you can see the decline in that team . 
once he left it 's not the same team . 
there 's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for . 
i think you 're right 
and i think those things do make a difference 
i do n't know who would meet them in the west . 
i watched only a few minutes of it 
and i was n't paying attention . 
and so i do n't know ,
