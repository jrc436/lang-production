it 's very easy for anybody to find out about you . 
i do n't really like that very much . 
what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff ? 
it was just as a demonstration to show those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person . 
mostly it dealt with marketing companies , these direct marketing , associations . 
that was the primary subject . 
and they 're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer . 
that 's not really good . 
i do n't know , 
i guess that 's an invasion of privacy . 
i 'm not sure that that 's an everyday thing , though , at least not for an individual . 
something that i feel is pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that 's really so common that it 's accepted as the norm now , is the open office concept . 
the open office ? 
that 's all fine and good , 
but you do n't really have any privacy at all . 
i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen . 
and it 's not just that , 
it 's the whole thing about if you 're trying to concentrate it 's rather hard , 
sometimes it 's almost impossible to do because your space is not your own space . 
and i work in a situation like that 
and i really kind of have a problem with that . 
do you work with mixed company , male and female 
is there anybody who does n't ? 
there are a few out there . 
i suppose it depends on who you 're working for and where at . 
but my own environment is open totally . 
there 's nothing to block anything . 
so 
but i guess we 're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody 's record , 
or the computers , the big advent of that because they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button 
and it appears in front of them , 
i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families . 
that 's no secret , 
and it should n't be that way . 
i do n't think that 's quite right either . 
it 's not really government for the people and by the people , 
i 'll tell you that . 
what do you think could be done about it ? 
it 's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that 's serving in the office . 
the only thing that can be changed is for everybody to say , we 've had enough of you , 
out you go . 
but i do n't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that . 
it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done . 
i do n't know , 
it 's still a free country insofar as we 're able to obtain information . 
and i would n't be for total banning of all information 
or , it 's mostly the private information that we 're all concerned about . 
but it 's hard to define a lot of those boundaries . 
it really is . 
something that i 've just had a dealing with is a credit bureau . 
they take my name , which is a very common name , 
and my last name is even more common 
and they check that name against their list 
and they find several . 
and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all , they just report everything under that name . 
they do n't even check my social security number . 
and companies are paying them good money to report accurately , 
and they 're not , 
they 're so lazy . 
they 're just not doing it . 
they just find your name 
and they match it up . 
then to get it removed they say you have to write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them , 
and then it takes three weeks and all . 
and i 'm baloney . 
you fix it . 
is that usually what you tell them in the letter ? 
what i 've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report 
and i do n't . 
and i said i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you 're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you 're providing to them . 
so then they can call the credit bureau and say , we 're paying you good money to report this properly 
and you 're not doing your job . 
good idea . 
so that 's what i 've taken to doing lately , 
and it seems to work pretty well so far . 
that 's good . 
any other problems ? 
not that i can think of . 
i can probably go on , 
i probably better let you get back to work . 
it 's nice talking to you . 
maybe again .
