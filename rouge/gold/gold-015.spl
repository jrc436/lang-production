i think the topic was crime in the city . 
i do not live in a city . 
i live in a real small little place . 
where is that ? 
north , south , east , or west ? 
not too far . 
i 've been through there . 
i 'm about eight miles south of it . 
but just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that , it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad . 
i 've seen those statistics and everything , 
i know , 
i know . 
i know . 
murder is nothing to them . 
i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , i guess . 
say you 're convicted 
and just let them go 
and if they get convicted again just kill them . 
i think that the best hope to eliminate crime , as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society . 
if someone is known to have been in prison , they ca n't get a job . 
you know . 
they ca n't be accepted into society . 
and who 's to put the limit on it ? 
and they 're still let out on the street after one or two years . 
so you serve your prison term , 
and then you go into the mental hospital , 
and if you 're pronounced cured , they 'll let you go . 
they may find a cure for it , 
but there is no known cure now . 
in other words , if you do something the first time , that 's not real bad , 
people make mistakes . 
to go ahead and let them go , 
use that 
or there 's other consequences rather than killing them , 
you could , always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against . 
at least they might get some benefit in that , 
and if the people they committed a crime against , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , are okay they can free them . 
but with the technology we have today , you can put a collar on a guy 's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property . 
and , you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act . 
but putting them in prison that does n't work . 
apparently not , 
because look how many years they 've been doing that 
. 
you look at places like turkey . 
turkey has the death penalty , for just about everything . 
if you get convicted of drug trafficking , they just kill you . 
you get convicted of heinous crimes , they just kill you . 
there 's no two ways about it . 
and you look at their society 
and the repeat offenders are very few . 
and you look at our society , almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison , has been in prison three or four times . 
three or four times , 
that is true , 
i know . 
one , you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven . 
i think that 's very important . 
i agree very much so on that , 
and then , if a parent has proved to be unfit , for any reason take the kids away from the parents . 
because we are what we teach . 
because that 's what our society becomes . 
we have just a bunch of people , 
i 've lived in that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work . 
and these guys , they come to work every morning 
and they 're stoned to the bone . 
they 're so high , they could fly up to the top of that building 
and they work all day , 
and they go home 
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs 
and when they run out of money , they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money , 
sure , 
they just think that 's the normal thing to do , do n't they ... 
and i worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester 
i had one kid threaten my life . 
in the first grade . 
and they flipping me the finger and all that 
and i just said to this kid , 
i said , you got two choices kid , 
you can step into mainstream society 
or you can die . 
because you will eventually be killed . 
i know . 
i know , 
i work in school , 
that 's something i do 
i 'm like you 
astonishing what the younger ages know , 
and they react to what they see at home . 
if they see violence at home , that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school . 
it really is , 
and that 's kind of sad . 
you can see it in the work place . 
used to be when you had a personality conflict you worked with it 
and you got through it . 
now people get fired , 
or what 's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired . 
or , one thing or the other . 
you put that many people on that small of a space , they 've learned to live together . 
it 's in their culture . 
teen . 
and the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people . 
if they were n't fit for the job they were hired for , they did n't just can them , 
they made a position for them some where . 
but she do n't like it . 
she just does n't like to do that .
