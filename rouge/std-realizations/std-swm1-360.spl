've never done it before ,
have to do so
guess so .
called several times
and pushed , in my number
they kept saying you have the invalid code
found out my phone new was n't working right then and
've done it even
wonder how long it 's going to be on for
this whole thing ,
for two months or something ,
do you know ?
do n't know
back to crime ,
we 're supposed to talk
they say , worried about
'm worried about every aspect for one
there 's so much going on here .
in the schools
know
be aware of
just heard last week at that one school
last year we had on the grounds school after school
is that right ?
and the one boy killed himself a few years ago , in a grade school ,
these kids do n't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any neighborhood
at all .
it 's kind of scary to think you send your child to school
wonder and if
we did n't
know
what next ?
know ,
it 's been out ,
and it just continue to get worse .
and we ca n't really depend on the police to solve all this ,
they just ca n't do it .
think it goes all the way back to the break
and how we going bring that back together .
,
, it 's
n't home with the children
and that may impact it as well .
think so
and then there 's , really
just do n't
think years past maybe our criminals have a little more morals would n't kill
they do n't think twice about it .
think it was just rare ,
really .
and he wanted to marry her ,
and she would n't marry him
he drove one day out in the country
himself and her ?
it was in all the papers , all over the country for weeks
i bet
know ,
it is just another killing .
was watching some
and they were talking
lots of their picture and life story and everything
to their life story
they came from a broken family
this person have mental problems
,
know ,
we up and all these twisted people before
is that right ?
think it was on a hard copy ,
she was a real attractive blond girl , in her year of college freshman ,
and , he was in his twenties ,
seeing that
remember that ?
saw on hard copy that .
is that right ?
you can believe ,
's
and he just shot them himself and her .
seeing that
is n't that
these days there are crazy just too many people out there .
know ,
some sort of a crime
just on the phone
that 's not doing anything .
