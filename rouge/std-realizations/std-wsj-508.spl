drug in the place work
drug in the place work
, just before employment
but that 's about it .
have never
random drug in my business
had to do it
they started that about a year ago ,
trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff and .

what type of field of work
is in the oil business
in the oil business
work in the office ,
so it 's pretty safe environment .
the automotive industry , which we make the safety bags for the cars , air bag
around a lot of explosives and we work .
that sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on .
, for it 's all explosives , because i work in they are working
they have with each of the explosives they use safety features ,
still , but it can be dangerous .
.
you are working in high risk industries , which you can hurt other people , that you need have that kind of stuff really

much like any lottery it works ,
everybody 's got

and is
that 'd be just as dangerous .
especially equipment , machinery and stuff around
that 's true .
had a beer at lunch time , but not
any limits on alcohol
tell you the truth
do n't
