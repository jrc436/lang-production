make a fair amount of money ,
get my money 's worth
though , is correct n't in certain areas in
'm sure in this country every person would probably agree with you on that
there 's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there ,
and 'm not really sure to have got regardless of the outcome of the desert shield situations we
there 's an extraordinary amount of waste
take that as a given in any military operation
no argument here
do n't know what other foe that would be ,
increased in that area expenditures
in the course of fighting the war
and they used up of them in the war two thousand ,
's see
as being a greater one
do n't think there 's very much of a threat there today
what nuclear weapons left over there in their territory
that 's true ,
that 's true .
do n't know what amount
used up in a matter of just a few weeks of course twenty per cent of that inventory
big a percentage of that and
what 's the name of that ?
and a big percentage of that was also used up during that conflict .
and that was an area
in the area of defense ,
pay too much there
do n't know ,
it , 's and a cliche
myself but
see where the infrastructure 's sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways
no doubt .
do n't know ,
're familiar with some school upbeat areas ,
do n't totally so agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there ,
the more affluent districts , when school ,
they do n't have a broad base income tax on fund the educational system ,
out of local taxes all
we have , then that the legislature said , we got to do this , a number of education reforms
we got to do this ,
we got to do this ,
in the state budget they put the money to pay for it
and they dumped all it on the local school districts .
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now .
so what ended up happening was a shift .
do you mean a complete reversal ?
because they ca n't raise that money in those poorer districts ,
complete .
it 's all , shifted to local districts
's even the money that 's been raised for the local districts and now
that 's right ,
that everybody ought to be able to have ,
what you 're saying
's a product , by myself
so did
my masters , anyway .
but when i look at it really to me it does n't make any difference .
could n't have done ,
that 's right .
you have to perform community service ,
out of their , budget
it does n't sound like a lot of money to me ,
do n't know what that would be
they have to raise taxes here community college , a few years ago .
and , the states do n't have enough money now
so they must charge fees .
's not sure too of that reasoning
too much taxes but .
whatever , a great deal in taxes
can believe that
it costs money me to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport tax departure
's not close to that fairly up
so you really ?
really .
feel my taxes have gone up in the last ten years ,
they have n't gone down .
quite a bit more taxes
everybody is .
what they 've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase .
this been really interesting
enjoyed our talk
i guess
again push one
we just say
and that 's it .
just hang up
talking with you
with you , too .
