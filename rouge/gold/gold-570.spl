does the company you work for test for drugs ? 
they just recently started a policy of testing drugs , which was kind of interesting , 
because when i went to work for them they did n't do that , 
but since then they 've started a drug testing policy , not because of their own convictions , but because the clients of our company requests that we do that . 
how about you ? 
we 're not being tested for drugs at all , 
it says , use of narcotics on company premises . 
so that 's pretty general , 
but i work for an environmental management firm 
and i 'm an engineer there , 
but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites , 
but i do n't operate any machinery . 
now , people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program , 
because they 're at a higher risk of exposure 
and blood screening is part of that 
they do test for drugs in that capacity , 
it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for . 
but i think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field . 
what is the nature of your company 's business ? 
we do oil well services . 
so , a lot of our clients are oil companies , big oil companies , 
we have engineers who go out to the client 's oil well , and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff , 
but the thing that 's interesting is that i 'm an engineer a software engineer 
and i work in the software house , 
and everybody there are all software engineers . 
they never go out to the oil rigs or anything , 
a little different , actually , 
but we have to go through the same thing , 
it 's a little different , than a lot of drug policies . 
in our case , it 's like , when you hire on , they 'll test you , 
and then if you get injured on the job , if you trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away . 
other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that , 
but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first . 
particularly we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol , 
and they did n't find any problem with that , 
that 's been an issue in our company even though we do n't have the random or even regular drug screening . 
in fact , they 'll have these little parties , 
my brother lives where i work , 
and i have many a time called him to come get me . 
and i do n't know , 
i think it 's got some relevance , 
but i think its relevance is pretty limited . 
in your case , i do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing . 
i think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident . 
it 's really bizarre . 
particularly where we are . 
and she was a personnel secretary 
and she had to get tested 
and , i do n't know 
i 'm ambivalent about the whole thing . 
they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense 
but i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job where i had to do a drug test 
and it was kind of a long story , 
but it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through , 
and it amounted to going in before any of these interviews , 
i 'm not even working for this company , 
i 'm going in for interviews 
and , before i went into any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical . 
they said it was going to be a physical , 
and actually beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening , 
but i had forgotten about that , 
and when i got in there , i was n't , able to give a full sample , 
and the procedure is utterly humiliating . 
you go in there with the doctor , 
he makes you take off all your clothes 
and then he examines you .
