go ahead . 
i think public service is a worthy thing 
and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as peace corps that promote that . 
and you have to do a public service project . in which leadership is the key element . 
i think that might be referring to something , kind of alternative to the draft . 
of course military service falls under the category of a public service . 
and , so one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft . 
but i agree with you , 
there are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of 
but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either . 
more of a voluntary kind of thing 
say , you can go into the military 
or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things . 
and it 's interesting because i 'm not a particular fan of the military 
but i have seen a lot of young guys go in that do n't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and are n't terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do 
and they come out 
and now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline . 
and it 's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn . that they do n't need to be cowboys . 
and for some young men , that 's good . 
for me , it would have been lousy idea , because i did have the personal discipline . 
why ? 
and i went to college for four years and got out , 
why is that ? 
but , for some people that 's good . 
i do n't like the fact that it 's the military 
that 's one view . 
and that 's another debate . 
and it seems pretty aggressive oriented , 
so , at any rate , this is getting off the topic
