.
which is your favorite ?
your family , then do n't ?
anymore
and that 's one of those things ,
you just have to go once a year .
i
out into that , basically
've only been there once
'd love to go back and
beautiful country
country
beautiful people
really like
we had a great time .
hearing for years
never met them ,
so 'd like to do that
but that 's our typical vacation ,
and we take one of each every year probably .
how about
but this year we 're not going to be taking one for several reasons .
've never , been on a cruise
we 've gone on cruise carnival lines .
's usually we just book before it a month ready .
we get and
last two times , in fact , we had an outside room
and it was beautiful .
what do you do on a cruise ?
've never been on a cruise
.
you want to be
you can sit around the pool in the sun all day ,
the games that they have going on
they have a casino .
they have a parlor massage .
they have exercise ,
you can do anything .
that 's and just aboard ship .
and that 's quite fun .
we 've been there twice .
but we went with different people .
we 've gone with friends each time .
.
me pardon ?
but it was
we really like so .
we 've been to a few places in this country .
we still have a lot to see , though .
you from
like the relatives and so , we always try to make it back home to see .
we both have family still there .
and that 's fun .
it brings a lot of memories back .
things different there , though
do n't know
just different than this area world
like it 's not so .
did you ?
and so they 're going very nice places ,
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know .
they 've been there eight years .
just the car and driving everywhere and .
that 's great .
it 's nice ,
but it 's not home .
this is home ,
've never and
it 's so funny .
as , we 've done them three times .
going again this year if
we 'd probably go .
my husband would ,
a little bit he kind like of the casinos .
all of that but .
the best part from
and other
like
so we 're going to be able to go up there .
that will be nice .
'm kind of looking forward to that
do n't go in the winter
that 's what everybody says ,
so that will be hard to stay away from .
for special occasions like that
the truth ,
that sounds
i guess
there 's all too groups age ,
and that 's kind of fun .
at a table with a lot of people for your meals
people thirty years older than you , or younger
and everybody is really interesting ,
and everybody is there to have a good time
they have shorter ones
and then they have ten days ones .
think but seven days are long enough for us
we 're ready to get home and get back by that time .
and that was pushing it a bit .
overseas , for a long time .
that makes sense ,
it really does .
that 's interesting .
and his father 's a doctor
and they took off time ,
it was their winter
and they were having a little break ,
so they took some time off that they could show around us .
and it 's a beautiful country .
it 's beautiful .
they have mountains .
we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore .
that 's really nice .
and it 's gorgeous .
and it 's just a gorgeous country .
most people do n't realize it .
think they 'd improve considerably coming if they could get tourists the economy
that will happen .
really hope so .
that 's really great .
said basically and forth to parents
that 's pretty good .
that 's pretty good .
and , my husband had a conference in l a ,
so we spent a in l a week
do you like a l ?
's very unusual
