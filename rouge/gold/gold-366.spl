you keep up with current events ? 
somewhat . 
somewhat 
not , 
not as well as i would like to probably 
is that right ? 
but that 's the way it goes . 
what ? 
state college , 
do you , 
we 're not supposed to talk about that . 
we 're supposed to talk about current events . 
so i try to watch the news , 
and i read the newspaper , 
and i like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what 's going on in the world . 
i see . 
what particularly are you interested in ? 
little about everything . 
and then again not everything , 
but i like to know pretty well what 's happening . 
just the events that happen around the world interest me . 
stay in touch with it and feel like i know what 's going on . 
i have to say all three of my children , none of them are too interested in current events . 
i see . 
but i always have been 
and i stay up with it . 
but how do you , stay aware of most of the current events . 
some of both . 
i read the newspapers sometimes 
that 's good . 
and i read magazines , and such . 
you stay up with it pretty well , then . 
not that badly 
so i am interested in what 's going on , 
you 've been there 
and . 
you would be interested in it then . 
i follow it , 
i do n't just read everything about it , 
but i 'm always aware of what 's going on like that 
because it 's interesting 
and i do n't know , 
i feel sorry for those people down there , 
that 's true . 
they 've never really had a good leader , 
and i think it 's been better since he died , 
but it 's still been bad 
i 've read some things about him that he was n't too good himself . 
he did n't mind having people bumped off for certain things . 
i see . 
those people are so used to it 
i guess it 's the only thing that works . 
i think we 're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have 
i really do . 
sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme , 
the media does , 
but , that 's kind of understandable , because of course if you watch it more than once a day it 's the same thing over and over and over and over , 
and i listen to the radio 
so you hear so much , 
you get a little tired of it , 
but then again , so many people only catch it once a day , maybe 
i do n't believe it could be better 
i really do n't . 
i think it always could be better , 
but i , would agree that it 's pretty good . 
i do n't think so . 
i do n't think our news could be better . 
what else could they do to make it better . 
i do n't see anything that they could do . 
i do n't know . 
you always want to think everything can be improved upon 
i understand what you 're saying , 
but by trial and error over the years , i think they got it about as good as they 're going to get it . 
that may be so , 
nothing is perfect . 
i think that i 'm not always satisfied with how deep they dig into things and such . 
that 's true , 
i understand what you 're saying , 
and then again , i understand why they ca n't dig too much deeper ,
