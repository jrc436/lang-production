did you go to college ? 
i did . 
and where did you go ? 
i had gone to a small school growing up , 
and what about you ? 
i am , 
where do you live now ? 
where are you ? 
he had moved , 
i visited once or twice . 
i really like it . 
i love it . 
i love it . 
i really do . 
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore . 
that 's correct . 
i have two daughters , 
but my oldest will be a sophomore . 
and one thing that i did this summer , which i thought might benefit both my daughters is , my youngest daughter got involved in band , 
so she went for a week , 
and it was overnight , 
and i thought this would expose both of them to what it 's like on a smaller college campus . 
and my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school . 
so i still think the exposure was good . 
what were your selection criteria . 
did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford 
or there 's all of these areas to look at in making the decision . 
and those were several that we did consider . 
my parents certainly did n't push but wanted me to look in the south 
and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one or small group situations . 
definitely . 
and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology 
how exciting . 
and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing 
and i ended up majoring in french . 
one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department . 
they also had a strong language department 
and i 'd always loved working with children . 
and i found that i could n't fit everything in , 
that worked out very well for you . 
but he thinks he wants to be a writer 
and i do n't think that , 
and so he 's used to a bigger size 
large classes . 
and because my brother is there he would have family , close by . 
so there are advantages . 
and they really felt like they were numbers . 
i went from a large high school to a large university 
and i definitely felt like i was a number . 
it is a different feeling . 
but that was my only option . 
i just really could n't look at anything else . 
that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior college , which i did n't want to do . 
so that 's how my decision was made . 
especially today with the cost of college . 
that is a major consideration 
and when you mentioned that , we have friends who have children there who just love it . 
and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are 
and it is a smaller size 
and i do feel like there are a lot of options . 
he hopes to be a writer . 
he thinks that 's what he 'd like to do , 
but he 's really strong in math and science , too , 
and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind . 
does your daughter know what she 'd like to do ? 
she has interests that are just going in all directions . 
and , i do n't know , 
she 's taken a lot of french , 
and she may end up doing something with that . 
and i am a single mom , 
and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married . 
so i 'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake . 
i 'm kind of really putting the practical application and saying , yet , do something that you enjoy . 
by all means , go get that piece of paper . 
do you just have one son ? 
i see . 
it sounds like he 's got some really good strong ideas of what he wants to do . 
and , of course , there is still time , 
but he 's beginning to feel that , as much as he enjoys writing , he wonders if he can make a living at it .
