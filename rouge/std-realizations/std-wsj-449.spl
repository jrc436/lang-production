what do you think about the school system ?
think they are having a lot of trouble right now
my son , goes to a private school
big public schools by definition city having a tough time now probably from budget cuts and everything else
why you did choose a private school ?
move at a pace along a little faster
public school
has he ?
then how he does like it ?
he is
he is a senior high school in this year
so he 's been there all the time .
he is done it the whole twelve and so many years
and it 's been really good for him .
how big of a school
, but in the upper grades , four about four hundred and something on campus about twelve hundred
maybe so it 's a hundred per grade .
a hundred per grade , that 's a good size .
it 's really .
we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture
and he is really well done ,
that 's good .
he was ahead just at an early age and
was still a pull out one day program and even in the fourth grade where they started
just and did n't think that was going
push ahead every day
are you just
is just , starting her ,
but seems to me that kids can really get away with murder these days
the teachers and
they have and
known
that 's a big problem .
that students do n't seem to show that respect
of crossing a teacher when we was in school
would n't
'll now stand there
you would n't .
think that 's wrong and
think we need get back to show some respect
warrant that
used to be , basic respect for elders and adults particularly in responsible positions , but
for other people
with little on your hands brats
is that
our society 's just stopped talking out ,
just this generation 's kind , or changed a little bit of
the world , changes
obviously , not as they used to be so .
a whole lot more things to
a whole lot more variety of
life is not as simple as it was at one time , maybe so
and just do n't
what that is n't just coming through is it .
we used to have to wear dresses
, did n't you
you go to dresses ,
it was and polyester
and it had
and it was when get down on the floor
we here up and
and it 's no more than so many inches above the knee .
so it 's
it 's really kind of gone the rounds ,
you kind of act
probably do have ,
this school your son goes to do they ,
