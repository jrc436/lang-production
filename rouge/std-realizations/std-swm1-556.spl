good coverage from the sources that you have
actually
out on most of the current events .
off the news , if someone start to talk
do n't watch a lot of it ,
that 's basically my only major source of information .
what about you ?
a bunch of different things
get every day
and try to have to look through that at least a few minutes
the short term news
do n't have enough time
much especially the news channels or anything like that
of it all about
the news is n't immediate what you 'd think , generally
but it 's
and it 's more in depth .
it 's more in depth , broad less .
actually , it 's probably less broad n't ,
but it 's just more in depth
and it 's just more significant information .
it 's the big events , not the little events .
a big auto accident down
know ,
trying just
or they 're making time
know ,
, too
and , then there 's nothing that 's really exciting so .
you may find one little item news interesting
so you have to wait twenty minutes to hear about it .
that 's about what it ends up being .
listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something
read as much as it
think that 's a good magazine but
they 're
at least in my mind
what kind of news and normally
what you do
that 's going to affect our economy quite a bit .
think it will ,
they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence ,
have yet to see it but
it 's real short term , though , yet
, three months or something like that since that it 's only been
but they like to tell us that it 's going to be important .
think it 's , too
think that 's a possibility ,
because it will be easier to do business over there too , though
.
for the companies that have already a presence over there
so they have a hold toe ,
toe good hold
once you 're in there , because then you can easily expand .
their own reasons have to be resolved yet
'm sure within those people 's minds
can understand ,
they 're starting off ,
their economy is a little bit weak ,
before they open up .
do you watch anything with sports or anything like that ?
actually 'm not really into sports
my roommates
bit of sports
against
we have to , fight over the remote control .
at least you guys have a remote control .
it 's better not to have one of those sometimes .
