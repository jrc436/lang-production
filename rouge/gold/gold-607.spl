our discussion 's about the care of the elderly ? 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
what do you think is important ? 
i do n't know how old you are , 
but if you had , parents or grandparents , whatever it is who were ready , who you thought might benefit from a nursing home , what do you think you would look for ? 
and he lives by himself 
and he 's in good shape . 
but some friends of mine have gone through this . 
do you have any experience with this yourself ? 
and we go there once a year . 
so we 're pretty far away . 
the environment there , i do n't know too much about it 
but it seems nice enough . 
it 's hard , 
at least half of the residents are not mentally sound . 
from the lack of stimulation , you mean . 
i do n't know . 
we also , my wife and i volunteer to go to a nursing home that 's just a mile from our house . 
she goes more often than i . 
we used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there . 
and we have a two year old son 
and so sometimes we 'd take him with us . 
and there i would say it 's the same thing . 
it 's a relatively nice environment 
but again it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but , certainly have retained all of their mental skills and so on . 
it must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really do n't know where they are . 
do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with , that the people who operate it seem to have , what you 'd perceive of as genuine concern ? 
i think they 're relatively respectful . and concerned in as much as they can be . 
i 'm sure that the staff learn what 's normal for this person 
and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person 's needs is really because this person is just in a state where they do n't really need what they think they need . 
it 's possible , 
i was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need . 
i 'll tell you one thing though that i saw that was really nice . 
we saw a husband and wife , 
we used to see a husband and wife in there together 
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were 
but these two were . 
and when you walked into their room , they had brought all their furniture from their house 
so it gives them a sense of identity . 
you walked in there 
and it did n't look like how , you walk into some rooms and it 's completely generic . 
there 's nothing , maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person 
and that 's it . 
and they had all their stuff from their house 
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them 
i think part of what you 're saying matches what i have read . 
but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because they provide a lot of social activities . 
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation . 
i think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there
