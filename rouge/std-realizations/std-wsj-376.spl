that 's an invasion of privacy really .
it very annoying when
that does in your part of the country happen ?

.
get a few things done
ca n't the telephone and
could put a stop to it ,
but do n't know what to do to stop it
a sign on

.
what can you do to stop that ?

would pick up the phone and listen to theirs
would get in the bathroom and lock so they could n't hear me , maybe the door
and then they would go get on the other extension

but it gets
see 's
'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors
do n't have that many people coming
, but we 'll have not as many as the phone calls here or there

right on a main thoroughfare
an invasion of privacy
hear a lot of noise , especially when at night
or would every time a fire truck and up
do n't even hear it anymore
.
