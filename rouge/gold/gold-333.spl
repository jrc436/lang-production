do you have children ? 
we have two sons . 
one 's a freshman in college 
and one 's a sophomore in high school . 
and you ? 
the story of my life . 
my kids are involved in sports . 
my daughter has played basketball for six years , 
and my son plays football . 
my rule is that they ca n't play a sport the same time of the year , because there 's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere . 
it really helped when the older one was old enough to get his license and could drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems . 
i know , 
i know . 
the insurance . 
for one thing . 
but 
we do 
but there was not much overlap as such . 
the older one was not at all into sports for the most part . 
and the younger one is the sports one 
and whatever season it is he 's playing , although football is really his favorite . 
so 
just family time . 
at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth . 
but we did n't do it as much or as often as i would have liked to . 
what about you ? 
i 've heard of that . 
have you ? 
i 've never actually played it . 
it 's really fun . 
and a lot of them played it , 
and she started a group going in the neighborhood 
and my kids wanted to learn how to play it 
and it 's more fun with four people . 
and it 's a game that none of their friends know how to play , 
and they both enjoy it . 
so if they want to play , they have to play with mom and dad . 
so we play that a lot , 
and we like to go miniature golfing and to movies . 
we have family that lives outside of the state 
so we go visit both sets of grandparents and take car trips . 
so do we . 
so we go shopping . 
so that just kind of works out real well . 
and i 'm a writer by profession 
and my daughter enjoys writing too , 
so a lot of times , she and i will travel to writers conferences together . 
that 's neat . 
so . 
we 've never had anything like that . 
so that gives us special time together too . 
and she 's on the yearbook staff and things like that 
so i can help her with that 
and she gives me ideas for my writing too 
obviously things are different for me and my children than when i was growing up . 
and the whole family was around the whole time . 
and then what my father did was , obvious to me 
and i helped out with it . 
but although i have brought my boys to see where i work , it 's not that easy , 
and it 's certainly not at all common , 
and they just do n't really have that same idea , 
it 's a whole different kind of thing there then , 
my husband has taken us to work with him , 
and we still do n't know what he does . 
so , we just say he travels a lot . 
so , that kind of covers it . 
that makes it hard though in terms of family time with him . 
i 've been lucky in that respect that i do n't travel too much . 
he 's been on temporary duties where he 's been gone nine months . 
so those are the real killers . 
he 's gone three weeks right now 
and that 's mild compare to the big ones , 
and something major , always needs to be done . 
so you just have to handle it until he gets home . 
and hopefully he wo n't have too many surprises when he gets home .
