been in one
but my grandparents were looking into it before
they said
's
was they and
and she had all kinds of trouble when
was she
she sort of
too much of
and they could n't deal with her .
handle the kind of patients
wanted to still have my grandparents
and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her
but they want to be independent as well .
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it
and then as become less able to take she then , she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care
and she did n't have to do anything anymore .
my experience but .
they get in there or what 's the reason
's only six months or something
a lot of it is
they need health care
before they so ill 's already .
that 's probably a large factor .
or have someone to can take
then only go there as a last resort .
as a last resort people or send you there .
peace of mind knowing if anything happened , there were there for them somebody
so that was
somebody would know what to do in the event of an emergency
that 's a problem too for people
i guess
you ca n't always
and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait .
when you need it , you need it .
and also the money 's another issue .
you 've only so much money at that stage of life
it 's not fair exactly for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings
it 's kind of fair ,
but it 's not fair because they have their own children to raise also .
so it 's another problem .
and if it was you , you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price
so is think .
are you with medicine being the way it is and
and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore .
just a shame
think the retirement home idea 's a nice idea
quite a few people
do n't know if they have them back there
