how do you get most of your current event information ? 
i 'm going to school right now , 
and while i 'm working , i do n't get a chance to read the paper a lot , 
and i do , like to do other stuff with it . 
while i 'm at work sometimes , on the computer network i read the news sometimes , 
and that 's kind of helpful . 
you keep up on what 's going on . 
that 's true , 
my roommates and stuff people around me talk about it . 
i 'm a housewife , 
i have three kids , 
do you watch major network news , 
just the regular channel 
just channel eight . 
that 's our channel here 
that 's the eyewitness news . 
so it 's kind of different . 
it 's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on , 
but it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they report on the news . 
and i think even in the elections , they choose who they 're going to follow and who they 're not , 
and basically if a candidate can get them to follow , then the news will kind of publicize his name . 
i do n't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it . 
i think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on . 
you just ca n't get a full picture of their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it . 
and the news , too , it just does n't cover that many stories , 
it just covers your basic violent crimes and your catastrophes with weather and stuff , 
but other than that , you really do n't know what 's going on . 
i will read our current letters that come out on elections 
and , i guess i do read that , 
and i do study who 's running in our area , 
and i do study what 's going on in the economy . 
and , i guess i do read other magazines too , to get my information . 
i subscribe to science news , 
and that 's real good because it gives a brief summary of , or the updates of what 's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would bog me down that i would n't know about 
but other than that i do n't really read , 
i do n't really subscribe to anything else . 
i used to read every month a reader 's digest 
but now i guess i just have friends that clip articles 
of course , when we were in war , i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on . 
but a lot of the times , i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper , 
but i just ca n't seem to find the time . 
if they put it out in a video , or on , not a video but a cassette tape or something , where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things . 
i know , 
we 're trying to get tickets to it right now . 
that 's going to be crazy that time of year here . 
i guess people want to hear about it . 
and they did so well last year . 
they spend a long time on sports , 
and i think that that 's fine , 
i would like to see more time spent on other things . 
i do n't know , 
they way they do the newscasts , i wish they kind of separated it , 
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it 
but i do n't have cable .
