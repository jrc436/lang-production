make a fair amount of money ,
get my money 's worth
in certain areas in general , though , the allocation of the taxes is
is sure every person in this country probably would agree with you on that
there 's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there ,
and is sure to have gotten regardless of the outcome of the desert situations shield we really not
there is an extraordinary amount of waste
take that as a given in any military operation
no argument here
do n't know what other foe that would be ,
increased in that area expenditures
in the course of fighting the war
they used up two thousand of them in the war , and
see 's
as being a greater one
do n't think there is very much of a threat there today
what nuclear weapons in their territory left over there
that 's true ,
that 's true .
do n't know what amount
, in a matter of just a few weeks , of course now , we used up
a big percentage of that and
what 's the name of that ?
and a big percentage of that were also used up during that conflict .
and that was an area
in the area of defense ,
pay too much there
, do n't know
and it 's a cliche ,
myself , but
see where 's the infrastructure sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways
no doubt .
, do n't know
is familiar with some upbeat school areas ,
do n't agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there , so totally
the affluent school districts , when more ,
they do n't have a broad base income tax on fund the educational system ,
all out of local taxes
we have a number of education reforms , then that we got to do this , said the legislature
we got to do this ,
we got to do this ,
they put the money to pay for it in the state budget
and they dumped all it on the local school districts .
now sounds like the way the federal and state system works .
so what ended up was a shift happening .
do you mean a complete reversal ?
because they ca n't raise that money in those poorer districts ,
complete .
it 's all shifted to local districts ,
are even the money that 's been raised for the local districts and now
that 's right ,
that everybody ought to be able to have ,
what you 're saying
is a product by myself ,
did so
my masters , anyway .
but when i look at it really to me it does n't make any difference .
could n't have done ,
that 's right .
you have to perform community service ,
out of their , budget
it does n't sound like a lot of money to me ,
do n't know what that would be
they have to raise taxes college community here , a few years ago .
and now , the states do n't have enough money
so they must charge fees .
is not sure of that reasoning too
taxes too much but .
who , a great deal in taxes
can believe that
costs money to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax me it
not be fairly close up to that
so you really ?
really .
feel my taxes in the last ten years have gone up ,
they have n't gone down .
quite a bit more taxes
everybody 's .
what they have been able to do is to slow down the rate of increase .
this been really interesting
enjoyed our talk
i guess
again push one
we just say
and is that it .
hang up just
talking with you
with you , too .
