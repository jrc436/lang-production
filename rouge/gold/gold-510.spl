i pressed the button one , 
so we 're recording right now . 
i 'm sorry . 
that 's okay . 
have you ever had to plan a family reunion ? 
it was n't really a planning one , 
but it was a birthday 
and i brought a lot of family together then . 
and how did you feel it went ? 
it went pretty good . 
i 've worked in hotels , 
so i kind of know how to do these things . 
i used to . 
all this planning and getting together and such . 
let 's see what else . 
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it 's my grandmother 's birthday , 
she comes from a big family . 
she has seven sisters i think . 
they show up and all their kids . 
let 's see , 
she has four sons and two daughters , 
and they show up and all their kids , 
so it 's a pretty big reunion , 
it 's about two hundred people , maybe . 
what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together ? 
probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone could eat comfortably and everything . 
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that for the rent , we rented a rescue squad building or something like that . 
and everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for soft drinks 
and so nobody really got stuck with the bill . 
that 's good . 
and each person in the family brought a dish , or something . 
and then did you have a main meal , 
it was just pot luck . 
it was kind of pot luck . 
everybody brought their specialties , i guess you would say . 
show off a little bit . 
and of course my grandmother 's food was , as always , gone first because she 's such a great cook . 
how old is she ? 
she looks probably like she 's in her early sixties 
that 's neat , that she 's in good health , at that age . 
my nickname for her is honey woman . 
that 's what i call her . 
that sounds fun . 
i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago , 
we sent out five hundred announcements , because our family is quite large , like your family there . 
and so that was a real challenge , 
and i was president of our family reunion for two years , 
and i was n't very at that duty , for two years in a row , 
but i found that advance planning was the key to success . 
also one thing that 's helpful , 
and i do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever 
but all my family lives in the same county 
that 's wonderful , though . 
but it 's just kind of like get on the telephone 
and , it 's so and such days from such and such date 
and everybody just shows up . 
that is helpful . 
i would say you 're spread out , then . 
we are . 
my immediate family my parents and my brothers and sisters , i guess we 're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever , 
because my dad was in the army 
so we 're spread out , 
nobody moves away except us . 
they must really like it there . 
i got out as soon as i graduated . 
just this town is too small for me ,
