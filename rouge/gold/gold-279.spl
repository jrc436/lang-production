the weather certainly has been hot 
and it 's been humid . 
it 's not really late into the summer , 
are you native to this area ? 
but , i know the summers get hot 
and this year we really did n't have heavy rains until may . 
kind of pushed the season back a little farther 
and it just tried to rain , 
i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
it 's really august that it happens . 
you get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry 
and it just gets so dry 
and , the earth opens up . 
i can remember the first year i moved here 
and it did n't rain , 
i moved here in late august 
and you sort of forget how much it did rain 
and coming here 
and then it did n't rain , 
it was just wonderful . 
and so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities , you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather . 
it might rain on your little parade . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
and here it was like , pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime 
and you really did n't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out . 
you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do . 
that 's right . 
what brought you down here ? 
a teaching job . 
i did for a while , 
so , i 'm home with two children , 
new career . 
new career 
i had been down here to visit 
and that 's how it worked out . 
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus . 
it 's a nice place , 
that 's a nice place , though . 
i lived to the west of it . 
i forget the county , 
but where all the lakes are around there . 
sort of . 
i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes . 
it was real close to where i worked . 
it was only four miles to work 
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that . 
in the summer , you feel like you 're on a vacation all the time because you 're right on a lake 
and everybody 's out enjoying the water and such , 
and in the winter time the lakes froze over , 
you could still kind of go sledding and such out there 
but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes . 
there 's lots of really small ones out there . 
maybe a mile , two long . 
that 's enough to do some boating 
that 's right . 
and it was lots of fun . 
that 's right . 
so it 's probably out in that direction , 
but that 's the only one i probably could name after all these years 
but it was just lots of little lakes 
and , of course , it was a little more expensive to live on the lake , 
but i just thought that was grand . 
and i think a lot of people did n't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them , 
but there was quite a few lakes all around there . 
it was almost like you were living on an island 
there was so much water around where i was . 
i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from the city limits 
and it was really nice out there . 
so there were things around there . 
really was pretty nice . 
and is n't that where they have a summer music festival there , too ? 
and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
we did n't do a lot of it , 
so those are always fun . 
so it was nice . 
but then it chipped 
and it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven 
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts . 
it lasted only a few hours , 
by noon it was gone . 
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me , better wait to go to work because the roads are all snow . 
and i was laughing , going that 's a good practical joke , 
they said , really , there 's snow 
and there was , but a very short time 
and the weather got warm so quick 
i know . 
course , when we get an ice storm , that 's not too much fun . 
that 's not fun either , 
our house is kind of on a little hill , 
they just go down the ice . 
and if it 's cold , we say , out you go . 
i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there . 
i think it 's fun , 
sometimes the ice is pretty bad ,
