advice on son or daughter going to college . 
that 's advice that i will need in time future for my children , rather than one that i have personal experience with . 
i suppose i would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs . 
let 's see , 
when i went away to school , i 'm trying to think . 
that was a strict requirement for me . 
again how serious a person is according to what they want to get out of school , 
i guess they 'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home , if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home . 
let 's see , 
what was the question , 
what 's the criteria for picking a college ? 
what advice would you give ? 
what advice . 
i guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus . 
stay in a dormitory if you can . 
go to classes , 
talk to faculty members and students . 
the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges , i think . 
the people are different 
you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you 're used to . 
i 'm thinking what problems my children might have in that , 
you think so ? 
but i agree with you . 
let 's see , 
what else . 
i 'd also advise them that if mom and dad paid for their college , that if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year , then they 'd have to get a loan to continue . 
course it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness , one , to work during the summer or part time . and two to take out loans to assume debt after college . 
that 's right . 
the responsibility of that . 
and they could work and earn money towards college . 
also if they stay within their state , you get a lot more financial aid 
or it 's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school , 
and also maybe then the parents could pay a third 
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is . 
so , it 's not too far away , 
mine is twelve . 
but it 's getting there , 
we still definitely can put away the money for college now . 
i would advise that they did not have a car at college . 
that 's my gut feeling , too . 
my son is certainly not persuaded of that . 
i 'm here . 
i did n't have a car in college . 
i think it 's more a burden to provide for . 
i think so , too . 
i think because most kids do n't have a car at college , the ones that do get taken advantage of 
and i think it 's just trouble waiting to happen . 
so i would advise they did n't take a car and , they did n't take a television 
and they did n't take a refrigerator .
