are
am
it is
had it ?
recently just got
and we bought a house .
but unfortunately the house is taking my time up .
a club for a purpose
in about two years
with the guys here and then went out two weeks ago
played out there , and in a tournament
kind of
laid long enough to get rid of all bad my habits off
try a slice through a hook here
and ca n't do that
finally got out ,
have been watching quite a few videos and
not have been able to play
took out a few videos
i hope is the right track and on .
and my handicap 's twenty nine .
that 's great .
like
been , too
have got my wife
that 's going to be one of the next investments probably
get out of the driving range
we can hopefully and start in .
bought her a set of clubs four years ago
even
won the tournament the other day ,
she is ready to get off into it ,
that 's good ,
same thing here
can get out and play a few hours of golf at least
and it 's not going to cost me , really an arm and a leg .
walk
do n't ride
a little exercise there
have got the same attitude
tell ,
eight or ten years ago , when now ,
and then while finally got into it
's been my main involvement
of winter when we ca n't do it the
it 's pretty nice .
and my parents came down what
was
we 're out playing golf ,
and they 're freezing cold back there ,
got into the service
i just kind of and let it now go , when
if one of the guys and then one day at work
and said
have got my clubs ,
in quite a few years
got into it , and then back out of it , and then
years to get back in there
that 's right .
really .
it 's nice really .
it is ,
it 's a lot of fun , especially if you can find .
that be the hardest thing
that 's true of any sport .
you do n't want to go out and get
people do n't want to play with somebody
is too slow for them ,
somebody around your own handicap
that 's right ,
have never yet up
with a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else
that 's true .
always .
that 's true .
on , come out
and they do n't mind , if you make a mistake ,
it 's pretty nice and friendly out there
that is so .
and you ca n't find in all sports
that is absolutely right ,
but play with the same people
after a short period , once .
'd like to work up
a mixed league
for that and
whenever that 's next month ,
and it will start then ,
of years a
and they were just starting to learn ,
and they were shooting a hundred , hundred and twenty
wo n't take it , so
that 's good
that 's good ,
that sounds like a lot of fun .
it is something we can do together , and
she does n't do much hunting ,
she could care less about that .
she does
but golf , would give her the exercise
she 'd be outside ,
give her something to do that
it sounds like we 've got real similar situations .
took my wife and along
and of the same situation .
and she talked the whole time we were hunting and stuff out ,
she 'll make if that comes along , but
but it is interesting ,
bowling bad if
you do n't
that 's right .
any novice how to hold one and learn how to do it , and to do it can pick up a club and learn right .
an in any aspect of it at all
that 's right ,
could pick two or three out of my game shots every time
can do it ,
just got to do it all on the same hole ,
it will get better , and then
and you just keep going ,
and you 're doing in .
it really work that way .
first got back into it
and did n't get it done
and need
naturally anyway
now the ball will go straight
never broke a club or anything ,
'd get sometimes upset about it , but
do n't get upset any more
and that 's great .
talking to you
bet .
'll go back to work
like
see you later .
