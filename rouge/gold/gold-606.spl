go ahead . 
have you every been tested for a new job or anything ? 
i have n't . 
but , in my job , i 'm a nurse , 
this is the rules that they can do this anytime . 
i do n't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested . 
they can if they choose to . 
have you had any experience with it at all ? 
not really 
but i 've always worked on a university level 
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff . 
so what do you think about that ? 
i do n't think they 're very accurate 
and i know they changed afterwards . 
i know of that too . 
and you can not get a job because of it 
and they may not tell you the reason why . 
i had a friend , 
it did n't cause her any problems with her job 
but what it was , was she had been , in the jungle 
and it was some malaria medication 
and she tested positive for that . 
and so it really is a dangerous thing that way 
because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and did n't get the job 
and they were n't told why . 
but a lot of people say the reason why , after you take a physical , will be because of the drug testing 
or they would tell you . 
or this person never use any drugs . 
i thought you got called back if you tested positive , for more tests . 
you should . 
because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something . 
i have real mixed feelings about it . 
i do n't know . 
do you know how wrong they are ? 
is there a margin of error ? 
the accuracy ? 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know . 
but , i know there are a lot of things that can influence them 
and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . 
i interviewed for a job recently 
and my doctor gave me a prescription for it . 
and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive , you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you . 
and it did n't come up that i needed to do it 
but this could happen to anybody 
and if they would just say this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything . 
so i do n't know . 
and i 'm not so sure they are that needed . 
i 'm not sure either . 
the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it , then they have the right to go ahead and prove it 
because they say they can spot check . 
if you 're using it while at a job , i can see a problem . 
but the occasional person , then it 's almost an infringement of your privacy . 
it sort of is . 
and this is it , 
i 'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways . 
as a health professional , i would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs . 
so as a patient , i feel we probably should be protected . 
but , on the other hand , there 's a lot of things i should be protected from that they do n't test my patients for too . 
so i guess you have to have trust some place along the way . 
you ca n't go around testing everybody for everything . 
so , i do n't know . 
if someone was out to get you , i think that a company or a boss could use this . 
they could keep on doing this to you or something , i guess . 
i can see where it could become a problem . 
and it seems like now they have tests 
i guess they can test your hair 
and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago . 
but maybe you should n't be held responsible for something you did several years ago . 
i know . 
that 's the other thing . 
a lot of people as kids or young people get into some things that they get out of later on 
and i do n't think they should really have to pay for that forever . 
there 's a lot of things you do as a kid that you would n't do as an adult 
but you ca n't say it was wrong at the time . 
i think that 's true . 
so that probably would n't be too good either .
