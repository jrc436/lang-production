go there .
a bit than this time of year
think that 's true
think so we are a little ahead of schedule on that
was out in my yard yesterday afternoon ,
noticed that grass coming up all , and
that 's true .
it 's been a fun breaking ,
but the breaking is over .
of weekends the last
every time at my window it 's gray
'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend , but
for that
a little worried about this one up here
we have long a weekend
a little bit on
heard whether it 's going to rain
clear out at least by noon tomorrow
and the rest will then be without rain .
that 's good .
for this time of year that is a little bit under what it 's probably
the weather on the news in the evening
is not certain either ,
but you 're probably right .
do n't like it when it is too cool or too warm
done when it is at that sort
that 's true .
, that 's the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't very much vary
you 're probably right .
other any time of year , that is not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold .
think it was one day a year ago this week and
they said we have a freeze and some kind of bad weather
it was n't just a bad super storm ,
we see in the late spring time
, was going into the grocery store
, was almost directly overhead and
and have never known to lightening at that temperature it
that 's pretty unusual .
and you take really notice of it , too .
that 's right .
lot up high
and could n't get away
do n't like that super cold stuff
move very well when
are enjoying really this now
this been interesting
challenging to the brain
in
but talking to you
you have a good day .
