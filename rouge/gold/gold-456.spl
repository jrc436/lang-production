what kind of foods would you have ? 
i like to cook 
i do too . 
if i have people over for dinner , i like it to be nice and relaxed . 
you ca n't enjoy it . 
and so i do n't like when they arrive , for me to be completely worn out . 
everybody just says how wonderful it is , 
and it 's , 
that 's one of those things i got famous for in college . 
it 's i ca n't really give you a recipe 
you 'd just do it . 
i can just do it . 
i like doing that kind of stuff . 
and it 's fun , 
we just had a bunch of people over 
. i like that . 
i do too , in fact . 
and naturally this is appropriate because i 'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night . 
actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays , just because it 's real easy , is just baked potato dinners . 
and have three or four couples come over , 
that 's fun . 
but it 's inexpensive 
and you got a great dinner . 
that 's a good idea . 
it 's real easy , 
i like doing that part . 
i 'm in favor of very little clean up very little planning because we 've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games , 
we invariably end up at my house since i 've got two kids . 
and it 's fine , because then i can just say , , 
you bring this , 
you bring this , 
you bring this , 
we 're done . 
and it 's pretty cool . 
that 's good . 
one of my favorites is to make chicken and rice . 
you do n't like it ? 
i love it . 
you do , 
i have a really easy recipe for that , where you just brown the chicken 
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan , 
and you can put mushrooms in if you want , 
how neat . 
and every once in a while , i 'll slice white grapes 
and , that 's just because i 'm not a real big wine person 
but i like it , 
it adds something to the chicken . 
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice . 
i 'll keep that one in mind . 
i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant kind of . 
or . 
let 's see , 
what was it , 
three quarters of cup of rice 
you can really vary it . 
i ca n't remember . 
i use that for rice 
flavor . 
. that would be good . 
let 's see . 
i think it was an hour . 
i 've done it in the microwave so often lately because , it 's really easy . 
i do microwave too , a lot . 
but , i think it 's about an hour . 
how long would it be in the microwave ? 
or maybe it 's only half hour . 
do you just brown the chicken to get it colored 
or do you go ahead and let it cook through ? 
i 'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster . 
this is a beneficial call . 
i like this . 
i liked your idea too , there . 
but that one 's an easy one . 
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup and the wine 
i 've got a two year old and a four year old 
and they love it . 
because my daughter calls it her gravy 
and she thinks it 's wonderful ,
