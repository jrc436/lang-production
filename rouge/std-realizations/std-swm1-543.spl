how many kids
think we 're going to talk about parents spending time with their children
so this is the big issue with us .
like day care and quality time said
anyway .
you do n't have children
's but
for two and a half years
trying for about two years
but no luck
hopefully ,
do this long distance
but actually are getting a call
could possibly take on call waiting
ask you
'll be right back
excuse me , just a moment
they 're going to get mad .
she had another call .
's
do you have a lot of activities with your kids ?
do n't want this to be a unilateral conversation
but
.
both my husband and i work
fourth , and third grade ,
the school years and
they 're
the kids , they
they and
and , they have their own all activities
in our personal situation really
our children have .
so they 're pretty good kids ?
'm sure that 's coming though
wonderful kids but .
can talk about us
we have kids nine in our family .
we have boys eight and one girl .
you have boys eight and one girl ?
he owned his own business
so we worked most of the time with him .
so that 's how we spent most of the time with him .
that was
come from a family of five
have four brothers ,
the only girl
everyone and asked if always .
never felt
always thought in fact
was going to say
usually for survival busy
do n't know
it 's an interesting problem .
'm a pediatrician
my husband is a physician ,
about this a lot
what is best for them and their family
have jobs that helped feel when my children were very young and
be a better mother and
that really .
help us to afford some things for our children
and have a real sense of priorities
it sounds like a rationalization
really think it 's true for our family , but
very well work
it 's
my wife stay home
there 's no question ,
think that 's really the best
if a woman 's happy doing that ,
put it quite that way
and would not
home with a young child
be a mother
but did it
i sort of worked half time .
have very flexible hours
nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year
all the time to mothers 's one of the things
the alternative situations that we have them in and .
it , sounds like a rationalization
lots of other children around
they and to share .
of attention the
we have but at the same time
help
that 's good .
like a you have sounds .
your wife does she work , right now ?
not right now .
we just moved down here .
's still
that 's no problem here .
we really liked it up there
