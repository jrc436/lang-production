you said you have four cats ?
have four cats
how old
they range from about a year and a half to nine years old .
have quite my oldest one nine years
have him probably five years
you get
my cats
lost one , one time
the first one
and he 'd never been outside outside by himself .
have a child
know ,
searching for this cat
i
and they laughed at me ,
,
through the same things with ours
they 've been ill ,
care of my cats
my boss think .
and then we have a baby
and it 's who comes first
the cat or the baby
the cat was here first
know ,
it 's hard .
it with us and then there 's when
how funny
it is whose corners 's this one .
that 's sweet ,
have the two ,
the other two cats
and they did n't ,
and they were n't doing very well inside ,
got a house
and they 're doing great out there ,
.
but he does n't want to do with outside unless you 're there anything
other than that he got
if he goes into hiding .
that 's it .
he 's probably been through all kinds of nightmares .
for life here
of ours all four
.
we started out with outdoor two cats
he did n't like cats
he lived through it ,
could n't believe it
almost the cat died ,
but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat ,
now he loves life .
i
and he 's so much thank you .
, when that happened
know ,
about that
but that was a traumatic experience for us too .
can imagine ,
with what did he
and then he started with a bull whip chasing him .
people crazy
absolutely
it took us out of the vet and surgery about six weeks in of
as he started off
and then we did all this for him .
but he 's been a wonderful cat .
i
usually after something like that happens to them .
it seems
do n't see us , without cats without pets
this void
ca n't take because they 're outside , as well
one day one of them wo n't come back ,
feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things and .
ca n't give them up but
about who is taking care of them
one hit on
my husband was such a sucker for animals until
he got sick so
and my husband just died .
it was we ca n't take back it
keep it now
here it is now ,
we have to keep it .
just move away from home
two weeks , when to realize ,
found so this one
that 's interesting ,
'll call them
and he was
and he was the last one she , carried across
the sad big whole story
have to take him so of course
so for him after that
asked the vet why he did that
n't even
but he does n't bite anybody
that 's good .
just .
'll come up
's kneading bread
it just drive us nuts .
cats
, like
they 're
lived at home
but they 're a lot more trouble than cats actually .
really .
the cats independent so
and they have so much more than a dog personality .
.
but they 're so much fun to watch them play .
.
,
get together , because it brings their personalities out more than one cat
and they act just so funny .
the two was outside , they 're like brothers ,
've never seen two cats so close
through the house
and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit .
it 's like this training .
a train of cats running around .
it sounds like a train .
we have wooden floors
through the house
funny ,
can imagine
would n't give anything for my cats
to death .
they 're
your cats 's names
sweet how
and what you have .
they do n't and
.
's a medium yellow hair cat ,
.
they do n't
not a thing
and they came from the same litter and everything .
and she 's
so she 's
you ca n't help but love her .
and she 's right there .
she 's the oldest one ?
she 's the oldest .
also moved out of the house
so
if something happens to her .
know
of the world the
it will be .
you get
my mother had dogs
's no and
this is nothing like cats .
you can walk a dog
and that 's
cats good all the time
if he was a dog person would n't it
it would have n't ,
that would be a problem .
that 's
like cats
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date
and there were all cats hanging over him .
have they
was and
he said , of course i love cats .
, the whole nine yards
it was so funny .
you getting rid of your cats
you getting rid of your cats
and you have cats
's
watch me .
the child will learn to like cats .
's
we getting rid of the cats
would n't either
'd be no way
was the whole family
that 's life ,
that 's how life goes .
but
just to death .
