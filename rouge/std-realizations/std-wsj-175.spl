had return something
, but ca n't decide
mostly it is
had return that many things
having a problem with right now
are
it 's a pretty good topic actually for me .
so , we 'll talk about that some .
we could talk about that ,
they longer last or something like that
let just a little bit about myself
have for the last four or five years , but
have two cornea transplants
is no fun anymore
can imagine
ca n't see ,
and it 's hard
you ca n't read labels
thought just
go there .
it 'll come ,
are
thought .
we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project ,
and we asked them details on it
because we bought a not brand name .
we call up , and
they were very happy with the system , and
and they felt they 've got a good price .
we went and , in
we explained what we needed
and
so we went , and there
we told them about the stuff
and the guy said the computer would fit our needs .
these things wo n't probably make any sense to you
but he told us we need positions to put our own equipment in the computer user .
it 's called a user boards and
or is slots what it 's called .
and we can
we , said , and so great
we 'll buy ,
in our order
a week and later went back , and we picked up the computer .
and we tried to put our own board in it
and there is only one slot we could put in it .
at one board and only we have
so it was n't so bad
so we used it a bit ,
but we tried to figure out whether we could put in three because we really need be able to put in at least three .
the computer was supposed to have two .
it has them
but the problem is that you ca n't put the type of card we need put in it , in it .
.
they told us there would be no problem because the salesman just do n't really know .
.
it has more to do with the people who sold it in some ways .
they were talking
that 's completely it .
the salesman did n't know .
so , we went back in ,
they did so that .
and we said
and they were doing it at their own costs .
and so we , said .
and we went back
and then we get ,
my husband goes to pick up last week it
, had just the baby
's life and
and get it , bring it home ,
first they are missing components of it like cables of all
you ca n't really so test it out .
and then second thing , we still ca n't
and now we are dealing with having to bring back again it
hope and so
it 's really .
you know , it are just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on .
so much time and goes
think that 's the worst part
put it on a gold credit card
the credit card company
and you do n't have yet to pay for it they said .
, that is n't it
it 's really .
for credit said
for credit said
think that 's really important and
these guys if they give us a hard time we 're going to say , you , look ,
if you ca n't fix this to our satisfaction , we 're just returning the computer .
that 's right .
that 's right .
pay , even though the charge
that 's right .
but they 'll just undo the credit that they did to them .
they will ,
that 's right .
they will ,
they will put the kind of clout on them that you ca n't really do .
she and so does n't remember anything
music and some of these things but .
the first time
was chewed up in the , thing and
then after that , you could n't so
says she and
so and you ca n't get it either to run the right way
what brand is it ?
you do know ?
could tell you
really do n't know which brand it is
was but
in our case where we knew we were buying a copy
think this is a brand name maybe
suspect that it 's probably , just a fluke and
have the papers and everything
and we 're going to take back just it
you do at some major store buy it ?
chain up here .
do n't they ?
this was a regular electronics store .
so do n't think there will be too much problem
not as well
a lot of things
do n't you ?
of course , it 's hard to think of an exact example ,
that 's good
like electronic stuff
their , working
as well as they could be
think that 's right
of years a
they may cost a little more ,
but they do n't have to take them to the shop every other day .
loved and it
it did a good job ,
so , part of it is that we need develop more of a pride in .
and go up clear
the people just do n't care about , what they 're doing .
nobody 's , paying really
just so get me my dollar
give me my paycheck , so can
doing what
think that are too bad
and too because it 's a shame .
there is n't enough .
a good job
's you paid
research
and get done so
satisfaction out of it and .
that 's right ,
the company
you 're
you 'll be the first one fired , so
you do your day 's work
we do n't really and
when you 've got that type of attitude on it , the people do n't care , about their work .
basically probably it goes right back .
really hard work at helping your kids to understand that there is just in working for itself without any pay value
just in whatever you little value
the value is in doing well it
doing a good job of it
