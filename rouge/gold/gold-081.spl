and you 're talking about credit cards . 
we put ours up . 
i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up . 
i wish i had . 
you should try it . 
it was done for me after a while . 
i had a business going . 
i do n't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that . 
but i had a coin shop , 
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up , 
and it started falling . 
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards , 
and things got worse and worse , 
and finally . 
you lost your business ? 
what a nightmare . 
it was . 
it was one of those things , 
it 'll get better next week . 
things will pick up . 
and , so , there i was in old bankruptcy court . 
you were n't charging gold and silver were you ? 
you ca n't do that , can you ? 
you can ? 
i was buying from other dealers , 
and they take payment any way they can get it . 
that 's a nightmare . 
course on merchandise that i was buying on cards , i was getting the money back , 
because i was selling it . 
i was n't buying just to hold onto it . 
but it was things like rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up . 
when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those credit card applications , 
of course you fill them all out because you 're honored . 
and it got up to couple of hundred dollars , 
and i thought , that 's okay , cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month . 
i was n't thinking a thing about it . 
i was just stupid , 
and every time they had a sale , there i was . 
because get such good bargains . 
and i do n't know . 
we 've been getting those . 
i went back to school and got my master 's , 
and they started sending those things to me again . 
as soon as you 're a graduate student they get your name . 
they did . 
and course , i guess i 've been purged from their records . 
back when i had my business i got one . 
and the bill would come in , 
and i 'd pay it . 
and the very first bill , i paid it , 
and then i got this nasty letter from them saying , you 're overdue , 
pay . 
so i said , it just crossed in the mail . 
so i did n't do anything about it . 
two weeks later i get another letter , even nastier , 
and said , we 're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do n't pay . 
and i looked at that , 
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank . 
turned out they were n't cheeky . 
they were , 
i tell you . 
they do n't talk about they 're charging that enormous fee every year . 
so what is it now ? 
or 
what do you mean 
for the green card . 
but then , what 's the interest ? 
that 's the card . 
of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in , 
so there is n't any . 
let 's see , 
it 's not too bad . 
credit cards . 
they 're dangerous . 
my parents do n't hardly use them . 
mine do n't either , 
mine do n't either . 
and that 's it . 
i 've got all my gas cards , because i do n't want to carry money around . 
i 'll do that . 
i do use gas cards . 
impact is kind of bad too , though . 
especially if you forget to record those little suckers . 
plastic is just too easy , 
that 's the whole problem with it . 
and you 're tempted if you 've got cash , a little bit of cash , and you do n't have enough for the purchase . 
of course , you got to charge it and keep your cash . 
naturally . 
i got into all kinds of trouble doing that . 
what are you saying ? 
my husband says i might buy it , 
but i do n't really usually consider that an option . 
having been out of the credit game for some years now , i 've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it . 
maybe that 's how we got in trouble . 
but it 's hard , is n't it ? 
it is , 
but , i 'm kind of grateful for the experience because it 's taught me a lot of restraint . 
it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic . 
with cash ? 
i wish i did . 
you could have got a discount , could n't you ? 
i could use a discount . 
i have to wait for things to go on sale . 
but there 's always a sale . 
especially on electronic goods 
especially now . 
what is that thing i saw , 
circuit world or something . 
circuit city . 
circuit city . 
have you been in there ? 
their prices are n't that terrific . 
they used to be , 
but they 've got to pay for all that national advertising now . 
it 's national ? 
they 're all over the country now . 
what else , 
they used to be good . 
i remember when they first opened up . 
they did have good bargains . 
or you probably have something similar . 
we call it service merchandise . 
you got service merchandise . 
it used to be service merchandise was the place to go . 
and circuit city came along 
and then after the years went by , they just sort of kept creeping up on price , 
and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now . 
so much for circuit city . 
what else can we talk about ? 
who do you work for ? 
i do n't , 
i 'm a graduate student . 
i 'm a professional student . 
sounds wonderful . 
it is . 
we were talking about that just today . 
it 's great . 
we could be just lifelong students . 
it is great . 
i love it . 
where are you going to school ? 
what 's that ? 
so you 're on spring break ? 
not yet . 
ours does n't start until next week . 
so where are you ? 
where am i ? 
what do you mean , where ? 
little , 
what a dead place . 
is it ? . 
i 've got a nice little business at home , 
so what are you getting your degree in ? 
human factors . 
and what do you do with it ? 
not a thing . 
what is it ? 
it 's sociology . 
it 's more psychology and engineering . 
my master 's is in industrial engineering . 
so you 're working on your doctorate ? 
that will sound wonderful , wo n't it ? 
get you a little plaque . 
a lot of people use human factors , folks , 
are n't they laying off several thousand people ? 
they might be , 
i heard it on the news today , 
if they 'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me . 
how much longer do you have ? 
and get that done this summer ? 
i 'm going to start this summer . 
i probably wo n't finish it until the end of the year 
why ? 
there has been so much work done already ? 
that 
and , it 's limited application in some respects . 
in the area that we 're in here , there 's a lot of places that use human factors people .
