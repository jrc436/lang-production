what were you saying ?
do you
at all .
i work with computers
with computers
but you have friends that have children .
have some friends that have children ,
that actually not .
do not really know ,
me
have , child care on premises
excuse me one
not at all ,
in fact my situation is a little bit strange ,
was doing consulting work
so 's just taking a little bit of time off right now
can i hope you stay as long as possible with it .
can hopefully do some consulting work at home
that would
spend the time with my daughter
but might start go crazy with it , too ,
the intellectual stimulation
but at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now .
it does when
they changing every day
the little things
put her in day care for joint , situation right now , unless it was with a person other one child
would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young
that 's right .
should get enough stimulation from the rest of the time you
that 's right .
they going to go there
that 's right .
i play with her most of the time she 's awake and
and think that is so important
, with the mother
and they took infants starting at six weeks ,
there are times of days and even when
the room not real bright
and , they have different things they will put them down on the floor ,
and of course , they never have more than five ,
and they will put them down on the floor
think one of them was a little mirror and
and some was just different objects that had a definite purpose for kids ,
and there 's something about their eyes .
how old is she ?
she 's two months now , nine weeks .
to another and things like that one
and she 's just started that yesterday , or the day before ,
every days different
child care for infants 's
a little older
so you might have a real problem with that .
really leaving the child in a strange place
things work out
but that 's unusual .
leave , even at this young age a fair amount with her grandparents , just to go to a movie and things like that ,
it 's your parents or your husband 's parents ?
my parents
so , it 's a little bit harder
she 's
she will not remember them ,
but she 's met them .
have grandchildren three ,
could not get my hands on them , is
, like
are
set up your program work and your husband 's so that 's one of you there all the time
for the child
you do decide to go with child care
at times that .
right now is the situation tight at many places , that it 's hard to have a choice even so
people before they get pregnant finding child care for the kids
and just .
and my sister-in-law 's going to very , very soon have a baby
because , my daughter and so will be about six months older than hers .
that would
she 's
and so she might be able to do it
and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis .
exchange that way
will and so we just
, too , .
of people a
and parents or .
well trained people
stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner
that 's real important to little kids .
my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet ,
and because it 's probably my fault .
she 's been staying up late at night
and sleeping late in the mornings and things are just fine by me .
and that 's a problem ,
society be geared to a person day
've done this ,
they stay up until all hours of the night .
