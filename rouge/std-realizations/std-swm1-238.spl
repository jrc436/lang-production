stay in line for four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor
's sort of mixed on this
one setup ,
.
they able to reduce because it 's all one centralized thing prices and that way
picking the major portion of your health insurance
was listening the other day on the radio
they could make , provide to people who could n't afford it just by the money they would save health insurance .
we 're
do n't know what the total cost of the program is
they 're probably picking up about half of it .
and that 's a pretty good policy ,
and they 're expensive fairly .
paid a month
but it 's at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care .
did n't like it ,
kind of really did
so my wife decided she wanted to stay with that doctor ,
so , we went to the medical insurance that we have here at work ,
the doctor that you like it 's not a problem
do n't want to have to be told
really does n't make you really like normally but if
that 's right .
and then , we did find several good doctors .
and like you say , it 's five dollars an office visit .
and my wife was in the hospital have our daughter
think her total bill was three hundred dollars for everything around and
delivery room and everything
little that she had to pay
was but
and have you come in
five dollars a
care of a problem
really liked it
both did
forms out to pay for reimbursement all and eight
you just pay right then the five dollars
and then you are done with it .
the doctor 's in hospitals practices but here again .
you take a hospital the physical plant itself ,
you have to pay your share of the operating eight story building when of that .
the costs out over all the patient costs
into the hospital for a week and it being , a four thousand dollar bill
they 're taking up the cost of people that ca n't pay .
they get a lot of there
they 're not going to get money
so they , have to somewhere else absorb it .
three in
and their insurance plan they 're under encourage you to shorten your stay in the hospital .
and she went in ,
she had the baby
and she was out in two days time .
almost like it , was an visit to the hospital outpatient
the deductibles did n't apply .
that and so if you 'll shorten your stay hold the insurance companies
