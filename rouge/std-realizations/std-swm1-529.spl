how about
what do you do with your budget ?
do do ,
it 's under chaos at the moment .
do n't really
and hoping the car do n't collapse
that 's true .
but
do n't really have a budget at the moment
can afford to spend each month
that unless the visa bill gets
and then it goes through the moon ,
that 's sort of a problem .
the credit clear
much of it on that
of how to put away some savings and stuff like that
so you can afford to get a house ?
we 'd like to do that some day .
we have this dream .
but , we do n't know how long it will be a dream .
we 're real happy to , do n't have we
get on every month
what do you and your husband do ?
are
overseas cause we have quota support
and it 's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here .
and it does n't
.
overseas , where you would be going ?
how long you would be there ?
about four years
we 're career
over for four years seas
and then we come back for a year .
go over four
we back for a year
with what church ?
who
there was a fairly large building that belongs .
in translation
we will be .
which is the first step
come home
always wanted to do translation ,
but it 's easier , as long as .
you do n't have kids hanging around you and stuff .
true ,
true enough
have a smattering of about ten different ones ,
did complete a survey in one area
can do in it better but in about five
's pretty good and
but it 's
's and
just picked it up and off the street
were saying
got a direct translation
and said
're not going to tell you
said to him
did n't either ask him , but
must have been terrible .
