i do n't know . 
and he is still living by himself . 
my grandmother died a couple of years ago . 
but he does n't want to move away . 
and he recently had to have an operation 
but he just really does n't want to go to a nursing home . 
is he able to still do everything himself pretty well ? 
he was until this operation . 
and now i do n't really think he 's doing that well . 
and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot . 
but my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three . 
and died six weeks after they put him in the home . 
and i 'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather 's feelings . 
because i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of , do they still have some of their life left . 
and , for , a lot of people going into a nursing home it 's like saying my life is over 
and i 'm just here for the rest of the stay . 
and so i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home , it 's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs . 
they can look after a lot of things 
but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore . 
i know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home . 
they generally were able to have someone care for them at home 
and they died . 
but they were all younger than your grandparents . 
i guess when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically . , 
but i just do n't think that nursing homes really do a very good job . 
and that 's difficult part . 
because i think what they often get used as is almost like a very high level or long-term care similar to a hospital . 
and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care . generally are not able to look after themselves to a very great extent , physically . 
but i think that it can be helpful in that it gets people the level of physical care they need . , 
at least i think some nursing homes do that . 
but i think a lot of nursing homes really are guilty of neglect . 
and i think it happens more in areas where it 's a broad social medical system where there 's government medical care and that kind of thing . 
if it 's the lot where it 's funded by the individuals 
and i guess that 's sort of my lack of understanding . 
but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay .
