.
have two children ,
have a seven year old and a three year old
try to spend as much time as possible with them
that 's good .
what kind of things do you do ?
a lot of things with them
or my oldest is in school
and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that .
was it a big change in your life , have a child .
it 's really nice ,
my husband 's working most of the time .
he 's working long hours ,
're staying home but
'm working just a couple days a month ,
what do you do during those days ?
a lot of time at the playground
to the zoo
you said you worked a couple days a month , though ,
what do you do ?
's a nurse
are
he 's really just starting to get interested in a lot of things now ,
understand
especially at that early age
she worked part-time when my oldest were little
and now she 's staying home all the time ,
but that really worked out well because it 's a big transition to have children
to go from nothing
every night 's fine ,
but it does n't work that way anymore when you have children ,
that 's right ,
a lot of people
still so many people that have their careers first but
think it 's really hurting the kids , and
with you
my wife lean
and 'm really glad she did
'm glad she 's staying home , and
some days when she wish she was back
know ,
like to work a couple days ,
think it gives me a break
'm glad my wife did , too
and that got her out of the house
most of the time at home ,
we started out like that
think that was ideal really and
to
,
but then when you start having two of them , because it 's a little tougher bit
it 's difficult ,
here forever
are
eight years or so here
that explains it does n't it .
do n't know ,
a lot of things on the weekends together
during the week , it 's usually
what 's
he work for coca cola .
he manage a plant out here ,
and it takes a lot of time .
'm sure it does
and try to fill our day with things like that ,
'm perfectly capable of doing it for them ,
but , it 's so much easier to go to mom ,
they get
but we 'd go to the library and do things like that ,
that 's good ,
that 's good .
and he works about an hour and a half away from our home ,
so it takes him a little bit of time .
and not be able to work during the week because of that
was working in the evening ,
and he was coming home
could go to work , and
just the time that they were spending together ,
think it really helped have that time together
it really does
think
have he been around children ,
he has seven brothers and sisters other ,
so there 's a lot of kids in the family
and he really enjoy it .
but right now it 's kind of a difficult time ,
and the cost of living is just outrageous tremendously so here .
it 's difficult to do it any other way .
i
you are not getting to spend as much time at home then ,
spend as much time at home , as he 'd want
that 's right .
that 's a tough situation ,
you got to do what you got to do , too , to get along
just consider myself at least
my wife , normally feel that way
are
, say take and she
're getting out
know
have enough during those days
know
a lot of people ca n't afford to get by just on one salary
to a decline in families and family values
.
really think that 's one of the problems the nation 're facing
but do n't know what
believe too
they need really focus on the children in this country .
of years a
really even think about it that much ,
aware of it
but it was n't really important to me that ,
your whole focus on life changes after you have a child
it really does ,
forming the mind
in the next year or so , you 'll see so many instances where he 'll mimic something that you 've done ,
and , he 's learning from .
that 's right .
that 's how they are developing their patterns .
a lot of people , do n't care or do n't realize it and .
just in the back of their mind it or .
.
it 's true .
know ,
think it becomes part of you too ,
you stay home
it 's not just for him ,
you 're both kind of bonding there together too
that 's true .
it 's been nice talking .
it 's nice talking , too .
luck .
