i 'm sorry . 
all , sorts of hours calling and telling me that i want investment advise and i want this service and that service or the other thing . 
i hate those canned messages they put on my recorder . 
my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen 
just what went into the 
i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not . 
but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using 
and , businesses would be prohibited from calling for business selling you things . 
i 'm sure that 's true . 
some of did too . 
i think government can do that now , 
is that right ? 
and especially with possibly children around . 
that could be useful protection . 
and i do n't have children around 
but i just do n't like those nine hundred numbers . 
so , i 've excluded those . 
but it does not stop you from the dialing services . 
what are dialing services ? 
where they intend to sell you things . 
where people just call you . 
and then those problems has been eliminated 
those problems used to be when i used a credit card they 'd want to have my phone number . 
and i did not like giving it out . 
i gave out my work number 
otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number . 
if you go in and buy anything they want your phone number . 
and i do n't think they 're going to call me and ask me how it 's functioning , 
and i do n't give that out . 
i have an unlisted number 
so i do n't , 
that 's one solution 
but you nonetheless often get people calling you ? 
despite the fact that your number is unlisted ? 
and you actually have your number 
anything that you buy you may get put on a , preferred list that is purchased . 
and companies can purchase this list 
and what that is is people who buy from the mail . 
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers . 
is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number ? 
some of that unfortunately is legal . 
so they ca n't stop people from advertising 
and that 's what it falls under . 
it falls under the guise of advertising . 
so , i do n't care for it , 
but is it a legal solution for some companies . 
so that 's the way things are . 
i do n't know . 
i think it 's gotten much worse the last , few years . 
maybe that 's just because i 've gotten on more lists . 
the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy . 
you 've got the holy rollers 
and you 've got all kinds of people knocking on your door and , who want to either direct you to the right path or want to sell you paper routes whatever , 
so it 's not just the telephone . 
sell you magazines .
