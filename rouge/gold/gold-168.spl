i do n't know what you think about the , subject , 
, i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the sentencing to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that . 
i 've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while i was waiting for them to phone somebody , 
and i do n't know that that 's not a good idea . 
that 's not a bad idea 
they probably , need to change it somehow , 
the whole system needs changing , 
we 've just got too many people in there , and are putting too many people in jail that probably do n't need to be there 
i agree . 
and it 's another form of sentencing . 
but on that one thing , i still think it should be a unanimous decision , 
i agree . 
i think we 're getting to the point now where they 're going to eventually let it be majority vote . 
and that 's not going to be good . 
i do n't like that , 
i do n't like that at all . 
but it was a drug conviction 
and i do n't remember 
he had some cocaine and was accused of selling it , 
and i do n't remember exactly how much he had 
but actually not selling it , 
there 's a difference , 
and , he was a courier . 
and he sat on that jury 
and they found him guilty , 
and they went through the sentencing phase and everything 
and they were told during the trial that this is this guy 's first offense 
and he 's got this clean record , 
the jury decided , it 's time to crackdown here , 
and it was time to do this drug thing 
and let 's crackdown 
and after it was all over they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers 
however , they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal . 
so , the jury did n't know about it , 
so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy 's first offense , 
but it 's just , horrible , since it was first offense 
and he 'd been convicted three times before , 
and the jury was very upset 
and my husband came home , very upset , 
i wonder if a judge did n't have control of that if some of that would change . 
the judge might know 
or at least it would n't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better , 
if it did n't we can come back for something else 
that 's true . 
that 's very true . 
we definitely need a change in the system 
obviously what we are doing is not working . 
it 's not working , too . 
it 's just piling up on us . 
and there 's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way , shape , or form , 
and either they 're in there , forever 
or when they get out it 's a matter of a few months 
and they 're going to be right back for the same thing 
we 're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes , 
that 's very true . 
i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day 
and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive 
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves , 
i know people say it would be cruel to pull our aid from these other countries 
and maybe so , 
so tell them , you 've got five years . to work out a plan , to make it on your own . 
and , we will continue funding you for the next two years , 
by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help . 
and then we will have the money if we would do that to work on your own system because we 've got some serious problems here 
and we 're trying to , heal the world , 
very serious . 
it 's just not working . 
you 're right . 
and i feel sorry for them 
and i know they 're suffering 
and i know they 're dying everyday , 
but we 've got kids here in the united states that are dying everyday , too and being , abused and neglected 
and i do n't know . 
i just have this problem with trying to heal the world when you 're so sick yourself , 
you bet . 
we seem to agree on the jury thing 
but , we 'll need an unanimous verdict 
and , maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make , a decision . 
i think we should try it , like you say , 
if it does n't work , we can always come back , 
but i think it would be a good idea to try it . 
i do too . 
so , anyway we all agree . 
good . 
good to hear from you . 
you too .
