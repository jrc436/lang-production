be , with computers and other devices
statistics more
that 's right ,
and those statistics in turn got bigger them budgets .
the overwhelming data seems to be available that there are a lot more violent crime indeed
more especially where
was going to say ,
a lot of business here
here quite often
that 's a sort of media perception and again
your attention grabs
it just makes
with little success , even though quite a bit of money and planning other efforts went into that
think are causing all this ,
crime do though sure seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too , .
have three theories about it three things
have one theory ,
bring by two things
on television and the movies
're not and talking just about models role of tough guys and gangsters and things like that ,
show some sort of violence to settle the argument
's an advocate of hand gun control to some degree , and then
have not seen that ,
think about it ,
think about it ,
do not know ,
your views
it seems anymore a movie can not be considered good unless there 's just some sort of violence or something in it .
and then you start making a movie
and there 's no call for something violent ,
something in there to say they have it just
that 's
it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society ,
people to it
spend money on something like that
'm sure it does form models role for young men and young women and
did not those things happen in that manner before television .
have to think it has some influence on it and
do not
because of just some of the things that he believed really coming down on him in
and he said
in discipline
they confused discipline with punishment
, if you have this type of a moral stance people come down on you
everybody be free to do their own thing
and
think that really are contributing to this rate of crime high and
so much of a return to prison that
be that and not
now , that 's a crime and since .
it does not
do not mean attachment and responsibility ,
nobody feel responsibility to do something .
it 's i wish they would stop doing that .
that 's right .
by statutory nature the changes simply come .
do not know what it will take really
's sort of an advocate of having free speech
and would be contrary to my beliefs in that
a higher for something of that sort
and the sacrifice 's not that great .
and think
think that 's correct
and
and it seems
citing that just
we 've got a lot of that influence .
