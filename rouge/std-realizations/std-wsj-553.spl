do you happen to be working ?
that 's not large compared to some ,
but it is big enough .
they do n't and
they did
put all the money into it , but
they do n't add anything .
about what you ?
i work for a fairly large company
it 's got eight people thousand .
and we do have health insurance .
but we do have retirement .
they kind of up to match , you
percent up to six
whatever the rest and then be in
that 's a pretty good deal .
it 's not bad .
how long it does take for your contribution to vest now
do n't know
it 's probably a long time .
i work is the place at 's , health insurance kind of expensive .
a month or something for a family
can hold back money
what those use of plans , too , where they 'll pay for expenses type child care basically
can send a request for payment in
and they 'll send me a check for the amount they withheld .
that 's pretty good .
it saves off on taxes or something a third .
you work for
know the plan that everyone seems to be , in my place in one 's plan d
deductibles really high
really unlikely you 'd use that amount of money
so , someone did start a benefit cost analysis ,
is a loss , what it happens to be and
i guess ,
has a similar health plan on the other hand
one of my kids and was in a car accident
even your car insurance
a high on the health insurance
no fault here ,
a high on the car insurance
that is too bad .
, do n't know
think other than health insurance an extra week of time off would be nice
two weeks
two weeks
until you 've got four weeks and then they give you every year an extra days
that 's nice .
your seventh year of
that 's a long time .
in companies do n't stay afloat that long ,
with the type of company telecommunications , you supposedly , used to be much more stable .
it 's a lot less stable than it used to be .
they used to have crap job security ,
n't but now
you work for bell or something like that
, do n't know
a lifelong job security
all that stuff
do n't think so
off people , which is another benefit that you can have other than for security salary 's trade off that
have , though
, do n't know
we have n't been doing layoffs .
of extra layers of management
for those people know
they get
some of it ,
