\section{Research Questions}
\subsection{Starting Point of Sentence Production}
We will investigate the likely start of sentence production by using the naturalistic model. We will do this by pre-biasing the utility of the versions of rules that are at various points in the sentence. We could compare several initial utility distributions. As explained earlier, we could then compare the sentence or sentence fragments on the basis of their ngram scores.

\subsection{Incremental or Non-Incremental Production}
We have both an incremental CCG derivation and a normal form CCG derivation of the switchboard corpus. In this way, our model tracer's selection of what rule is \textit{correct} is really choosing from a set of rules, and it's using a derivation in order to guide it. However, at any given point, these derivations will have different rules that are correct or incorrect. By adjusting the model tracer, we can compare using the tracer model which of these derivations is more learnable.  

\subsection{Other Ideas}
The organization of the types for any given lexsyn and their initial utilities could also be investigated using a similar method as the starting point. For instance, with some uniform organization, we could investigate any number of questions, such as whether it is easier to start sentences with nouns.
