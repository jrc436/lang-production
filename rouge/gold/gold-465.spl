usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news . 
the news , 
but i do n't think of that every day , even . 
i get them from everywhere . 
we do n't get a paper 
i teach a college class 
the library has a paper . 
and so i often drop in on a break and read it . 
and i keep the radio on quite a bit when i 'm home . 
and then i figure if there 's big news , i 'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or , someone else . 
i get it from all over . 
i watch the news every day , 
we get the newspaper , and magazines , anything . 
i read a lot , 
i 'm really up on current affairs . 
i get the news and everything . 
what 's your favorite news , 
do you get a news magazine 
i 'm not getting any news magazines 
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage ? 
i do n't know . 
is there anything missing ? 
it 's kind of hard to know . 
and i do n't know , 
what are we supposed to compare it to the quality , 
whatever they tell you , 
i guess i 'm satisfied . 
they 're supposedly covering everything that happens , 
you know . 
i 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something , 
i do n't ever hear it in the news here . 
it 's so slight , 
the tremors are so slight that they do n't even bother putting it in the paper . 
but most of the times i find that even if they do have tremors out there there 'll be a small article in the paper about it . 
. that 's what sells papers . 
that 's because there 's a high crime rate . 
that 's been like that since the first newspaper . 
i 'm sure . 
but i do n't know . 
i guess i 'm satisfied , 
what basis of comparison do we have really ? 
that 's true . 
we certainly get enough coverage . 
we can get news , 
sometimes you do n't even want to be bothered with the news because it 's all so bad . 
it 's all so negative . 
so . . 
we have to keep talking , i guess . 
i guess we can end . 
is it really ? 
have you always gone until the recording ? 
i guess we 're not supposed to . 
i do n't know , 
i guess we 're supposed to wait 
or i do n't know . 
was it last week , we were supposed to talk about gardening 
and it was really funny , 
i mixed it , made the call , 
and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away . 
we were laughing , i mean . 
but we do n't really do any gardening , 
so that took a minute 
and then we just talked about whatever . 
interesting . 
some topics , 
there really is n't much to say after you tell the person where they find their sources of information from 
and then if they 're satisfied , 
and that 's about it , really . 
it 's hard to talk for five minutes on this . 
you 'll hear one report
