let 's see , 
i guess it 's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing . 
i enjoy playing basketball and basically all kinds of sports . 
excuse me . 
not really 
i 'm really not too creative 
i leave that more up to my mom . 
i think it will become resume writing . 
let 's hope that you are n't employed by that craft for too long . 
i hate to think about it 
and i 'm getting rather good at reading want ads . 
what kind of time frame is it looking for the different shifts up there ? 
who knows . 
i 'm sure the number 's somewhere classified 
and twenty percent would be one thirty . 
how about that . 
that 's possible . 
how about that . 
that 's unfortunate 
are you in the defense ? 
is it many other corporations in the area ? 
i hear they 're hiring all over the place for that . 
apple 's coming to town 
and that has some opportunities 
how about that . 
personally i 'd rather die a slow painful death 
you in the computer operations or in the actual manufacturing ? 
i 'm a defense worker . 
i 'm , government tool control specialist . 
are you still employed ? 
exempt or ? 
exempt . 
unfortunately for myself it was purely by my own choice . 
there was no incentive for myself to leave , 
but it was just an opportunity arose 
and decided to take it . 
so , you did n't even get the severance package . 
i should have taken the , option when that was there , 
but it was just , i missed it by a couple months . 
but what can one do . 
i 'm just happy still to have a job . 
are you happy with what you are doing now ? 
i am kind of happy with it , 
it 's getting better all the time , 
i knew it would be different from the very beginning , 
i was in the computer operations 
it all starts to become similar 
there 's benefits 
and there 's things that were n't as good , 
but as an overall package , i 'd say i 'm pretty happy so far with the way it 's turned out . 
it has n't been a long time 
or i 'm significantly shaken by the situation , but not devastated . 
the one thing at least in your favor is the fact that , that is more in the support of the manufacturing 
to tell you the truth , i 'm not really worried . 
that 's great . 
that 's good . 
and i seem rather happy about it most of the time , just to know , what might happen . 
sometimes it 's good just to have everything out on the table . 
but still in all , it feels funny . 
it may be a blessing in disguise . 
actually , the positions that they found outside of the company were much , much better than the ones that they currently had inside . 
so , despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains , i ca n't seem to get into it right now . 
i doubt i 'll be here in six months . 
would you like to be there ? 
all things being equal . 
or even somewhere better , 
that whole area is actually quite nice . 
that 's a beautiful place . 
that 's just fantastic down there . 
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want , 
pick out where you want to live , 
and then once you pick that spot out , pick out what you want to do . 
that 's the problem . 
and now i feel lost . 
it takes a bit of a shift does n't it . 
i had job offers . 
but , i never found the one that was worth it . 
the best thing about it is that you can try something 
if you do n't like it move on to something else . 
that 's the way i would have looked at the whole thing here , 
i 'll take a chance , 
five years . 
. there 's a noticeable difference there . 
momentum is , uh , driving force in our lives . 
i 'm looking . 
that 's good , 
you 've got a good attitude about it . 
and i 'm looking at it as a change . 
and i 'm looking at it as an adventure . 
there you go . 
that 's the way to do it . 
there you go , 
that 's the thing to do . 
, how about we end this ? 
that will work out just fine . 
nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you .
