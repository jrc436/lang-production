and they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste . 
it 's not too new . 
they really did n't propose any solutions . 
but , he had a lot of facts to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down 
and , one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of news print . 
and they could sell it for a while . 
they were able to sell it for some amount per ton 
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling , they 've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away . 
that 's a common problem though . 
we 're doing some here in cash valley , the community here . 
we 've actually got a kind of a nice set up . 
we 've got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it 's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation 
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them . because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside . 
that 's good . 
so one of the real keys to getting recycling for paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . 
and i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days 
and they 're making clothes now that are recycled . 
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government . 
one was environmental protection 
and the other one was i ca n't remember what , 
but the basic idea , it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill 
and the solution that he came up with for plastics , it was really quite amazing , 
he says , the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them . 
he came to the conclusion , plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it 's low weight , but it 's high volume 
so it takes up a lot of space 
and there 's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling , 
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it , produce electricity . 
so his solution was to burn plastic . collect it and burn it . 
it 's carbon 
so that makes sense , 
a carbon fuel of some sort , 
but what about emissions ? 
and it 's more than even paper or something like that . 
there is more energy in it per pound or whatever . 
he did n't deal with that . 
he just said burn it . 
he did n't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that . 
so it 's not very practical . 
it 's interesting . 
i bet that was a good day , at the conference then . 
real interesting . 
did it change anything for you ? 
not too much . 
i got .
