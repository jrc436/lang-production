i do n't know a lot about them . 
that 's great . 
actually that 's kind of the type of car that i 'm thinking about we might get . 
and supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things i 've heard . 
i 've heard a lot of people like them . 
like what ? 
let 's see . 
i like cars that are designed with human beings in mind , 
and that 's not just the driver and the passenger 
but that 's the person who 's working on it , 
cause i do almost all my own maintenance and those types of things . 
almost unlikely at this point . 
and i do most of the work on that myself . 
and when i look at modern cars and stuff like that , i just say i will never do that with the modern cars . 
it 's not worth my time . 
you ca n't get in there . 
you ca n't do anything . 
and it 's so complicated too . 
i look at it 
and i say , boy , 
i 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that . 
and i find that for everyday things . it 's really very easy to work on 
and i 'm kind of spoiled . 
and i really liked working on it . cause it was pretty easy too . 
so i 'm kind of biased in that 
and i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore . 
and that 's probably one thing i 'd look at . 
i think another thing i 'd look at is safety . 
that 's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about . 
that 's a real nice car , i think . 
it 's a really nice car . 
i think , it 's a stylish car both inside and out . 
it 's comfortable to drive . 
reasonable performance , 
i 've been real impressed with that . 
and i did n't realize that they were putting dual air bags in that car now . 
i think that , that 's excellent . 
but the thing is that it 's twenty thousand dollars . 
actually , my wife and i are actually contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so . 
so we 're actually been looking around and thinking about things . 
i do n't know . 
what do you call it ? 
that would be a good deal to go with . 
because they looked really nice . 
what do you looking for in those ? 
but what kind of things are you looking for ? 
i do n't think you can get dual side air bags . 
i 'd say the most important thing is a car that 's not going to fall apart . that does n't have problems . 
you set down . 
you look at consumer reports . 
we 've been pouring over consumer reports 
and then we kind of want a four door .
