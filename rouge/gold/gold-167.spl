i 'm pretty pro gun control over all . 
i 've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control 
and i 've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it . 
i guess on a scale of one of ten i 'm probably around a two in terms of 
i do n't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort . 
and guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me . 
i hope you 're ready for this . 
i 'll give it a try . 
i was raised around guns , hunting . 
so i do n't have a fear of fire arms in any respect . 
i respect them and what their capabilities are . 
it 's pretty is n't it ? 
and here you go , 
that applies to anything as well as guns . 
any of the big cities you 've got the different rival gangs 
and they 're going to fight with them . 
if they want it they 'll get it . 
they 'll get it 
and they 'll get across the border . 
since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony , if i wanted to buy one , i do n't think there should be that big of a restriction on it . 
if they want to run a background check on me . 
if they want to put a seven day waiting period again . 
you do n't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way , i would hope . 
is this guy a convicted felon ? 
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems . 
just proving that you 're basically a good citizen . 
you just told me that you 're going to get one of those guns anyway . 
because it does n't matter how restrictive your border control points are 
they 'll get it across the border one way or the other . 
so why have any restrictions at all ? 
go back to that one to ten scale where one , being , full gun control , ten being none . 
i 'd said about an eight . 
but whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able . you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon , how to safely handle the weapon , how to properly maintain it , the three basics . 
that makes a lot of since to me . 
i certainly feel that we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm 
but i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that . 
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon , as a pistol . 
i have a bicycle 
and that scares me too to tell you the truth because i 've been run off the road and all sorts of things . 
i 'm still puzzled though , 
what is the argument , 
how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway . 
basically , the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway 
they 're not going to take those courses . 
is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns ? 
if it 's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must 
does that mean advantage ? 
not necessarily a price thing . 
l a area ? 
bay area . 
you 've been to the city ? 
and all these people come around , 
i 'm out with my family 
we 've gone shopping , 
we 're fixing to get in the car , 
this guy comes up , 
i can pull a gun on him now . 
and when you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick . 
what if you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon ? 
then it 's still equally matched . 
having spent time in combat i feel it before they 'll get the gun on me . 
if i walk into a bad neighborhood i 'm sure i 'd want to walk through with you because i 'm sure you have far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything . 
in this sort of wild west scenario , you 're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature . 
it 's more of a police action in itself , 
and if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public , then this individual also knows this guy 's pretty good with it . 
whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not , that 's another trip , 
in defense of myself , defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat . even more so when it comes to my wife and son . 
anybody tries to hurt them i wo n't even blink , 
i know , 
i understand that . 
what if you think someone 's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake ? 
this is where the question of gun control comes in . 
that was the topic . 
what , i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot . 
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up 
i go ahead and pull my piece . 
and i make sure this persons sees it so that he 's got now doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then . 
and the only reason i feel comfortable doing that is because of the training i 've had . 
if i 'm the one doing the shooting i do n't miss . 
that 's the kind of training i 've had .
