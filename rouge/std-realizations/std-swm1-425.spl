you think you 're getting your money 's worth
never
that 's probably the next year 's agenda .
, to tell what
something like that
a way to tax every time you
and , we 're going to pay for the bureaucracy , i guess .
it is one area that 's really hurting the economy more than anything .
available for for any kind of products spending
think and that 's probably as a big item fueling the recession as anything right now
tell ,
or a few more cents onto the prices of gasoline
that 's right .
that 's right .
that 's right .
they tax food even
the problem with the sales tax is , of course , it 's an unfair tax across
but now with the lowest income people pay
n't and where people make two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that
that , 's and the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue
but do n't think it is anymore ,
got you ,
that people up spending all it
that 's right ,
that 's right .
whatever they they have to pay tax on .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
think but
what do you think of that new car luxury tax , anything over thirty thousand dollars ?
like other things , if , you do n't worry too much about them .
have trouble still buying a car twenty thousand dollar ,
of sympathy on that a
you buy , maybe that
have n't ,
another ten percent tax on
and there 's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand .
,
.
's the idea of that kind of taxation and
buy ,
it 's just like having on taxes or exemptions for kids .
it 's a way of increasing the population ,
that was one of the initial ideas of giving exemptions on kids , on federal taxes .
do n't know if that 's true or not ,
but that might make if certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers .
like booze example , they keep raising the taxes on booze ,
they quit buying it .
what about the taxes on cigarettes ?
