and i was fortunate not to have to serve in the theater , 
however , my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation . 
i 'm of the old school that believes that the contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored . 
however i think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker . 
but those are my personal thoughts , 
and we managed to come out losers all the way around . 
and so this is what ultimately triggered us united states per se deciding to get out of the role of world policeman . 
your views , 
and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another , 
i question us now , 
so , we have to deal with the situation as we played it .

i just do n't want anything to do with her any more , 
because you support your government . 
right or wrong ? 
right or wrong ,

one moment . 
fascinating . 
sorry for the delay . 
that 's okay .

and i do n't think everybody knows the whole situation . 
i do n't . 
and we did n't do a whole lot better . 
i had thought that they had colonies there , or something . 
that was the old french colony , 
we go in as an ally to the french and says we 'll help you out , if you get in a bind . 
they got in a bind and says we do n't want to play any more 
i missed it . 
roughly . 
i was just probably three or four years ,
