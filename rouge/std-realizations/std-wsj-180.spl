what type of music do you like ?
like , and sort of popular rock music type
too
have never really
my wife and enjoy it .
have never so
whenever she does
it and even put on myself .
used to play the piano ,
those nice really
like
do n't know all that much myself ,
known , just when
you like .
about how popular music ?
a hard time hearing clearly the words if
are pretty much the same way
known
, known
known
can remember after the song 's over
it two or three times
is the same way
it is
the difference in the radio with popular music , and is totally different ,
so , it was sort of a funny thing .
there 's a big variation among the country ,
are starting to realize that
really , never thought about that much
but there 's .
moved to this area
did n't really
it just seemed
it really changed , but when .
does it ?
you do n't have to wait till the hour mark .
it 's sort of constant .
you turn there , just
the latest news and everything and .
and it 's on .
that would be beneficial really .
so .
the news basically on the radio
never get
behind if you 're in , all the time the car if
that 's pretty good .
like to listen to of music , on a long trip stuff tapes
now you can get on tape books and even .
does on fact , because she is blind , my grandmother
or she 's .
can imagine if you are driving cross country listening to a story
lot of the classics
so , that 's a lot of fun
that would be good .
so guess .
music comes into that whole aspect of listening
we can cut off just
it was
good luck ,
and you make more some calls
thank you .
