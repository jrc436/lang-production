we 're supposed to discuss crime in the united states and what can be done with it .
that 's a rather broad topic .
they 're usually pretty
where do you live ?
where
that 's frightening so .
it is ,
do you have children in school ?
in college
my oldest is in high school his first year
so we have
think you ca n't even send them to school in safety
when you ca n't even on their normal activities in safety send them , but , it 's really frightening
that 's true .
coming down on
really what but what they can do .
it 's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs
and do n't really know what can be done
just do n't understand , in my little world how guns could be available so , of course
n't either
really just apparently they but .
and my son tell me that he hear talking about having guns kids
and someone came to his football practice with a gun about two weeks ago .
and just scared
and they call
and nothing happened ,
but it could easily have .
maybe that 's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution
maybe .
and people do n't do anything .
and said all the neighbors .
but nobody did anything .
just ca n't imagine that
someone calling for help
the police to say
do n't blame people with today 's society about going to help themselves out
from a house or something , maybe not going over there , because it could be dangerous ,
but certainly ca n't understand calling the police not
and one of the best things we could do for crime is probably participate in its prevention ourselves .
think you 're right there
in their own business
think that 's real dangerous but
and do n't know
try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of what is around them
a situation that looks could be trouble
do n't know ,
do n't know ,
people just have to care about another person
maybe that will , maybe this thing with the child at school .
do n't know ,
it 's really frightening .
let
he did n't have a license for the gun ?
do n't know
do n't know the details
this was not a child that was on the team .
it was someone that , just kind of showed up at the field .
it was a student age person ,
