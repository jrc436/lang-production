why do n't you go ahead and start
think the court systems could stand some improvement
trial by jury 's good
do n't know
think so .
and that 's the sort of system they have .
they 're like lawyers i guess .
they 're in the law experts
and there really is n't a jury
also the questioning and .
the judges
but not be
the jury system myself
the jury
your chances better
of judges or jury a
's what i worry about
that 's where you really need a jury of peers .
because you need of ordinary citizens the protection .
that 's true .
think that 's really the only thing
all the time
maybe a judge 's better of that a judge
sometimes the sentencing 's not fair .
they do decide
'm like you , but
do n't know ,
's maybe
think they should be in a lot of cases ,
twelve people into a courtroom , i trust
usually a matter of what facts to believe
people do n't have days in day out long life experience with what prison and
a hung jury atmosphere
think in a lot of places but
a for jury or whether the judge gets to choose it
in some jurisdictions , they some cases can do that .
i kind of like .
that 's not a bad system .
do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit but
blow lawyers and .
before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
insurance cases and things like .
of people 's heart strings and making them cry this
putting on a act
, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government
