what ,
to go ahead and tell me about your home .
my home at the moment is an apartment .
is
that is interesting .
let 's see , and
we compare homes
correct ?
my home is typical for the area .
living in a development
is
is that
but it 's upper middle class kind of an environment .
two a story
is that
that 's large .
it 's so forth relatively typical for the area
probably for the area
are
larger and
it 's probably ten years old .
that 's not too bad ,
that is still fairly new .
compared to other parts of the country there is
who worth down there is it
in the market really
right now it 's a lot lower because of all the layoffs and everything
the economy around here is real poor .
thought that was on the upswing again now
not really .
be tremendous amounts , layoffs of
so , housing is really real bad .
the economy itself around here is not terribly too bad ,
but housing is still real bad .
now it 's really a buyer 's market there .
been a lot of speculative building
, do n't know
a new carrier was coming in and the attendant vessels support .
that 's no longer , the case .
it is .
single family units on
overbuilding and so been a real problem there
you can get a good for a very , very reasonable price house still so .
, on a half acre or so of land , two and a half baths three
upon the neighborhood
what about your home ?
but it 's a home .
it 's a home bedroom four .
it 's on one floor .
we have no basement .
, do n't know
nor do we ,
was n't sure
most of the ones north and everything up
but it also is pretty typical for the area anyway .
most of this area
it is almost twenty years old ,
most of the houses around and here .
over two blocks
otherwise is pretty much , but the layout
most of them
most areas there were two or three styles probably
and , that 's pretty much in the area , for a square mile probably least , maybe even at a little bit more than that all the houses
west
they designed it and everything ,
and they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand when they left the area .
that 's not unusual ,
are there for example
was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium and
it was very done nicely .
a lot of money
ca n't envision spending , that much money on something along those lines
maybe a little bit higher than that now ,
that same house here , but you 'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year , taxes on it
that much of a difference ?
it 's really sad .
the highly most areas in the country
is
you do know ?
they do have such things as good extremely school systems , for example .
it has one of the best in the country school systems .
public employees make great salaries around here .
this is the figure ,
they did not define it ,
