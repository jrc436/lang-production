the question was talking about the juries 
maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again . 
so that a judge would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . 
i kind of agree with that , because i think in some cases the jury may not even have , the information about other crimes the person has committed . 
and if they 're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing . 
i agree with you . 
one thing i heard was this , where instead of going to the regular court , they have a mock court . 
it 's supposed to be all legal and everything . 
you go 
and you present your case , 
the other side presents their case 
and you 're done with it . 
it did n't backlog all of the cases that are all ready pending . 
that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way . 
there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed a jury trial ? 
there 's a point on which we do n't agree . 
i would tend , myself , to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime one of the parties wants one . 
and usually it is the defendant that wants to have the jury hear the case . 
that would require a change in the bill of rights , i believe 
and i did n't mean that . 
i did n't mean that , 
i would feel that my civil rights had been violated . 
but i meant for some , when both parties agreed that we 're going to have a judge here . 
we 're not going to have a jury , 
let 's get it over with . 
sort of car accidents , 
i think that 's all ready possible . 
i think , that you can waive the right to a , jury trial 
so . i agree that that should be encouraged . 
people should know that that 's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial . 
giving a different sentence . 
the take . 
i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though , rather than civil . 
is that right ? 
in the case of , civil things maybe the use of the jury is very , often to the lawyer 's advantage 
there are cases where they could be settled , maybe out of court a little more efficiently . 
it 's to their advantage to play to as big an audience , as possible 
so . i was wondering too , if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in a criminal cases . 
i 'm not so sure i 'm in favor of that . 
but i am in favor of it for criminal cases 
so there 's a difference of my view there for those two . 
you can tell i have n't been in too many judges chambers or anything like that . 
have you ever had to serve jury duty ? 
but i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me 
they let me out . 
and that was almost twenty years ago . 
sort of amazed me 
that would have been about twenty years too 
just last year 
and the case i heard was a criminal case 
and it seemed really , trivial . 
it involved two bicycles . 
we did n't do the sentencing . 
the judge did . 
how interesting . 
we rendered a verdict 
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing .
