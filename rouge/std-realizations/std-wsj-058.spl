what do you do this weekend ?
pretty much spent most of my time in the yard , or at nurseries buying for the yard stuff .
what you do
but they have gone of neglect a few years .
so , we 're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation .
different beds flower in
of a few problems and things like that weed
what part of
on moving to mound flower
and work garden
seems like it
the place we 've been living at we 're just leasing it .
'll
'll
just scratching two or three inches was just a chore .
it was ,
it was
and then you do n't want to get out in the yard , even when
it 's horrible .
it 's a nightmare .
it is actually done ,
know right where that are at
we 've got to a foot of soil maybe eight inches ,
it is solid rock from then on down , and then
it , is ,
put in anything as far as shrubs and things like that
it is .
how do you put in there trees ?
so far there is already trees , there
anything like that is
is an awful lot of
it , not even , considering a pool or anything like that and
in i guess
and it makes for a different challenge ,
keep hearing the stories of different parts of town all but
and the first thing the old guy at the stands there asked what is part of town because we lived
each one and work in one part of town
that 's it , and
that are basically
we tried planting tomatoes last year
and they turned out pretty poor .
'd known , the variety and everything
we have also roses ,
in fact , we put .
what roses type ?
a few different , type tea hybrid varieties .
of the real short stem a
but do n't know
because the sun 's so intense ,
the roses just fine there
is that
we 've got the lake different editions all around the house
and we 're
the direct sun in
complete long just all day
and , we are struggling to find something for those areas .
not have you , done a lot of surgeon tree work on your trees
they are in pretty good condition .
we 've been pretty lucky on that .
just if , that may be all right because , we have some fruit old trees .
so we may be getting rid of that just
they be doing just fine
but they really need pruning .
a year is not really enough
that 's true .
that 's true .
do n't know
what kind of grass but ?
would hold
but it does n't really .
but .
there is such a difference , through the year .
it 's already
they have been living there for now about three months ,
been bad so that have tried to plant grass
they have some big problems time , and , just
that 's it .
just their lawn blow away
but it 's
they have about two or three acres of land on property lake front , on .
it is beautiful ,
you can see the house from miles away ,
but it 's a pretty neat little job
but , they save a lot of energy
but they 're going to have to start gardening just for them .
is it
the whole way .
they said , and we just plan on spending the rest of our lives , just getting this property developed .
it 's amazing ,
, and do n't know , what they have
all the water
actually , they can pump water ,
they have to get permission
but they can pump water up from the shore ,
they have to pay some kind of fee per year .
think right now , though , but
but just think of all of the money that they 're going to have to spend getting just that
really them for tax and .
and you are talking just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes .
it 's ridiculous .
that 's really ,
limit that flow into it , even though
the dry land farm
but do n't know
just to come back
and the air is just so dry .
do n't see how anything can survive out there , for long periods of time
they are smart ,
they are about the smartest around tree .
that 's true .
that 's true .
say they
is so that
they do n't do anything .
one of the house and things like that
of weeks just a
it is kind of disappointing .
do n't know
off just a little bit
