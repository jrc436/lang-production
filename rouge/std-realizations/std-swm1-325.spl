how did you like that topic ?
do n't know ,
've got mixed feelings about the topic
do you ?
n't
with it
test any time any employee
just do n't think there 's a place in our environment in the work force for drugs or alcohol either
do n't believe in drugs or alcohol ,
did you ?
that
that 's true .
because at people airline pilots bus drivers i look that really have other people in their hands truck drivers ' lives
that 's right .
that 's right .
be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol
that 's right
a big problem with them use
in those areas really do
think so too
with it
of years
many of the people , even the people professional they were so against them and so doing
, to me it 's quite simple and
either you need a job
you or n't
the job is what provides all of your needs ,
ca n't do this work
wo n't do that
, although they did n't like it at first
think it 's just like anything else , a concept new ,
it is ,
the same way if
ca n't do we but in education at
that 's true ,
are
bet .
what
why do not the kids , if , under the influence them and they 're but when
with that
at all oppose
just our heart liberals
that 's true .
do n't know how long are we supposed to carry on a conversation , do you ?
it 's three minutes ,
've heard it not have we
have it ?
both sort of we
agree , unless it 's not me
listen ,
going here again
my children 's school , when high ,
is that right ?
you just do n't think of that happening with teachers
n't really
think of the outside of education
a society as anybody else
know
but you do n't think , normally of that first hand .
it was on the news tonight .
with you
just like everybody else
same problems the same good qualities as anybody else .
'd probably if
in school as well as out an
and that was in your children 's high school ,
is n't that amazing ,
my children and brought it to my attention .
was never there to see it
'm sure it 's true with just about every school there 's
and that 's not giving a good example to students .
they do n't need that example
