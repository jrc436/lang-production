do you do a lot of dining out ? 
we do n't although we enjoy it . 
we do it more when we have company come . 
what about you ? 
we do some dining out . 
i do a lot of cooking 
so mostly when we go out it 's my husband and i , 
we do n't go out too often as a family unless it 's a fast-food kind of thing . 
but we do enjoy dining out . 
have you ever been there ? 
i 've heard of that 
but i have n't been there . 
where , about is that ? 
have you ? 
did you like it ? 
i love it . 
and we came up one time when my father was visiting 
and we all ate there 
and their seafood was wonderful . 
it 's fabulous . 
it really is a great place . 
and then they separated 
and , i loved them both . 
i really do . 
i think they 're wonderful . 
that 's our favorite . 
have you been there ? 
but i 've heard that 's really good , too , 
it 's wonderful . 
the only thing is you have to wait . 
you have to expect to wait at least an hour . 
so you have to go knowing you 're going to be sitting there for an hour waiting to get in . 
and , as long as you know that , it 's okay . 
but they have just about the best prime rib anywhere in the area . 
i love it . 
and , my husband really likes their ribs . 
we go in 
and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in 
and then we get there 
and we do n't even look at the menu . 
you know right away what you want . 
i know right away what we want . 
we really enjoy prime rib , too , 
and actually the steak and ale out here we 've gone to , 
and the time we went the prime rib was really good . 
was it ? 
i 've been there for lunch 
but , i 've never been there for dinner . 
and , it was good , 
that 's great . 
that 's , great . 
i 've heard about that , too 
have you been there ? 
but . 
i guess we eat out even less than i realize . 
and i did n't think we ate out very often . 
i had heard that , too . , 
i 've never been there 
but i 've heard it 's real good . 
have you been there for lunch ? 
primarily lunch , 
and breakfast sometimes 
the specials . 
i keep hearing about it . 
i keep hearing the advertisements of it 
and they keep saying it 's wonderful , 
it 's wonderful . 
i have not been over there 
and i 've not been there . 
i have n't either , 
one place , 
and i 've only been there for lunch , 
but i went with a friend , 
i 've been there . 
that was nice . 
it was 
and we both enjoy mushroom soup 
and they did . 
it was wonderful 
and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert , which was a chocolate sack . 
i 've heard of it . 
it 's all chocolate made like a paper bag 
and we shared one , the three of us 
and it was plenty because it was very rich 
but i wished i 'd had a camera . 
it was beautiful . 
i bet it was . 
i bet it was . 
and we took another friend with us 
and it was outstanding . 
it sounds wonderful . 
it was really relatively simple 
but it was good . 
it was really good . 
that 's one of the things that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant . 
i love fresh berries . 
and , their fruits are always exceptional . 
i do n't , know 
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer 's market you ca n't find them like that 
you ca n't find them . 
and i was home a few years ago 
and i was really amazed , 
they were real , real pretty 
but they lacked , the service 
i do n't know . 
i guess there 's so much competition that they , really have to be good . 
and , i thought i would really miss that . 
i would , too , 
because we do n't go out very often . 
and it 's a whole experience . 
of course you want the food to be good 
but the atmosphere and service are important too . 
and in order to survive in this area , i think they have to be good . 
because the ones that are n't so good just do n't make it . 
that reminded me of a place for lunch that 's a little off the beaten track 
but it is wonderful .
