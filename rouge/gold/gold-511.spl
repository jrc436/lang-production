you want to start ? 
i might as well . 
one of the things i 'm very concerned about the air pollution , is the ozone layer issue . 
that 's stuff we never even thought about three years ago . 
they could be made and lots of it , 
and its properties were great with the machinery , 
did n't have to have lots of expensive machinery to get your heating and cooling cycles to work . 
have they stopped that practice now ? 
and that 's got me very highly concerned that that 's going to be quite a while before we can undo this . 
that could spawn several good industries and help , pull us out of this recession , 
but you got to have people that can earn a salary to pay for this conversion . 
how many families own a refrigerator , 
there are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks , 
and that 's a polluting type deal too , is the excessive petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth , 
i hate to see a car going down the street , or even a truck or bus for that matter , that 's putting out a lot of dark smoke , 
and i know there 's a lot of pollutants we ca n't even see coming out of cars , 
diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine 
diesel is going to be around , because it does n't evaporate easily , 
its latent heat is high , 
but it 's slow burning at , normal pressures . 
i see .
