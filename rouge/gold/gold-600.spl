we do n't even have to cook dinner anymore . 
but i 've heard that a lot of families really do n't spend a great deal of time together . 
the kids maybe on the average get something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents . 
that 's what i 've heard too . 
it seems bizarre to me . 
i do n't quite understand it , although i think probably the worst thing that 's happening in , at least the modern world today , is television . 
i know it . 
i tell myself sometimes , just sit down after work , 
so i refuse to have one in the house . 
good for you . 
good for you . 
i talk to a lot of people about that 
and i 've thought about it myself 
and i though about it a lot 
but i still have n't done it yet . 
that 's good . 
i 'll tell you . 
television sure makes child rearing easy on you . 
and you do n't have to worry about them . 
that 's true 
i 've noticed that . 
but i do n't think it 's too good . 
i do n't think so either . 
so i do n't know , 
i do n't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids , 
but i take advantage of dinner time . 
we always eat together 
do you keep your kids active in sports or anything 
i guess our big outlet is music . 
and when our son started playing violin , i took up violin 
so there 's plenty of interactive time in practicing . although neither kid likes to practice . 
i guess that 's not a big surprise . 
not for kids . 
i try and read to them 
and i take them to the park and stuff 
and . 
reading is so good . 
i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little 
they get to that stage . 
have you ever seen that yet ? 
sleep book , 
it 's called a sleep book 
and you ought to get it . 
i think his sleep book is my favorite . 
i like to do it 
and they enjoy reading . 
i never read a lot growing up 
and i never read until a few years ago 
i just started picking up books 
and so i 've found that it 's really important to me to get to read . 
, i like to get away in a book ? 
so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day ? 
i probably spend an hour or two . 
that 's great . 
my wife works at night , 
so she 's gone a lot at nights 
and so i spend a lot of time with them . 
i see . 
how old are your kids again ? 
they 're two and one . 
two and one . 
so you have your hands full with them , 
that 's for sure .
