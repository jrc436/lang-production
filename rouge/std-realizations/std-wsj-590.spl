a prime discussion topic in
certainly ca n't argue with that
do need some improvements
throw out for no reason people
think there 's a limit on that
the , peremptory challenges
think it is , four or five ,
but you can ,
ca n't remember which
last year was on a jury trial
as the last selection that the defense got out
have a severe demeanor or something
typically , but everyone gets
it be a group of your peers
he wants somebody that will give him a guilty if the facts warrant verdict .
the jury selection process is
but do n't
and more than a jury knowledge
about , the person
made , as a recommendation
but think it should be up to the judge , and the lawyers to make
is the judge because they are the people known
a more consistent procedure
you may be right on that
preceding , according to the judicial process
and the jury 's
it is ?
did n't realize that
during the trial , not
or not have nothing to do with their background
think to what kind of sentence you 're going to lay down , but when
all the way through a jury trial
they got too boring .
so , what you 're saying is , if this .
severe more than a first offense , because obviously , did not the rehabilitation processing work the first time
got so to give them in the system or a different process that will work better hopefully either more time
when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing is
you give them the option of working off their time doing civil sort of things service .
about what collar white crimes like .
a whole lot
like what ?
