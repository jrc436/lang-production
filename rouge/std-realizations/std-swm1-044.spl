you want to start
identify as first myself
it gives me a perspective on that
happen recently to both in society women in the work place
a significant change both participated
,
and you see women going off to wars as well as men .
allowed both the father and mother going
the children and .
that 's kind of a drawback to me .
it 's
being brought up in the day care centers
wonder about them in what way ?
from what .
more
they contentious more much
have much experience , with children in that situation
my experience 's just with what we did
and so they really did n't go through the route child care .
they were able to be home together .
and we never actually experienced that .
to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so
just do n't know
what do you mean ?
one might conceive of the possibility that there might be a kind of a professional mother , person .
that 's strange .
and make
have a philosophical problem with that
that 's right ,
that 's right .
relative to being a mother or not
very much have an interest
necessarily with the necessity to have
, do n't have
that did n't bother me ,
never
day care to
it would be a sort of day care ,
but it would
to come in and live with them ?
could easily envision that
to come in and live with them ?
was going to be four other kids
and you were paying for really high quality care .
more of people like that with an opportunity that 's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
a day care
the day care centers not cheap either
have n't ever really looked at them
you at all aware , of what they cost
single several mothers absolutely ca n't afford it
on and taking care of the children
that 's just a rate that you have to pay
do n't really have a vision
that 's , too .
think that they will be more in the work place because 's the door open .
and it 's just human nature to walk through an open door .
would be glad to see that and
're running across single women all the time
that and be a troublesome little .
it 's awful .
and maybe that 's a change we 'll see .
the men perhaps take care of the children , in the event of a separation
think we 've done it
think we 're about to do
thank you very much
it 's been interesting .
you take care .
