of this middle east affair we 've got going on that
our own borders than
have to agree with you there
just let
.
we 've got so many domestic problems ,
what does it cost and these people over there .
so how about the soviet union
think 's going to happen there
the break ?
think that 's great
'm glad to see
's not much in favor of it , and so
'm glad to see but
that does n't seem to cost a whole lot of money .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
have some sort of a domestic agenda , at least
even if it does n't work at least , he 's somebody who are working
so they do n't seem to have a clue .
's important ,
wo n't just
and then there 's the homeless issue ,
and we would n't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars that we 're spending each year .
.
be sort of the bank world , , as far as
think there 's a limit , and
and we passed it a long time ago .
.
we 've been off writing too many bad way debts country .
are things like selling technology and even to foreign governments military hardware and then forgiving their debt
to me that just does n't
know
do n't know
think it 's definitely for a change time ,
but , do n't see
are turning into a black and white society ,
you do it this way , either ,
you or that way
and there 's no in between
that 's right ,
you 're either liberal or you 're conservative ,
and it 's obviously n't working .
think it would n't hurt ,
the independent party get a real force in congress
but you 're right ,
think if we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed and
with you .
of course it seems to me that every time he open his mouth , he
so , it 's not too often .
he 's the one of the two that votes ,
he 's one of the two .
, very
's see
in for six years
and when you guys did vote him into office ?
are you
with him for a little while longer
