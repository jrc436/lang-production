i wonder ,
the assumption is that it 's a problem ,
it 's not clear to me , but it is .
do n't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions
that is interesting ,
feel it also is a problem ,
your on that
poor blacks vote very little and things like that , for example --
if they were voting , than your average voter vote
but do n't know if that 's the case
of studies on suggest that are n't
apparently they do n't think it 's a problem .
guess not
i vote
really .
is a fan of democracy
vote on
that 's right ,
we have now these state initiatives .
that was , and ten years ago
you vote for yes or no on each of them
and no one could make heads or tails out
was and
we do n't want to have to decide all these things ,
people for us make we
i kind
we was given an opportunity to vote on more things
they speaking for us
but they are not speaking for me .
votes more than
that 's true .
fine with me as long as
that would make me happy though .
, but in a deep philosophical sense in a selfish sense , it would probably
, do n't know
it is interesting ,
some countries 's voting
that 's true ?
, did n't know that
that is one solution to it .
feel about that
that 's not really democratic .
consider what truly democratic
and it 's not for me to say they are not .
you have the right to vote here
as a duty there
just as we have a duty to pay taxes ,
that 's democratic ?
the right to pay taxes in this country
we have the duty to pay taxes .
it 's a duty .
it 's a duty to pay taxes and in that country
and it is
and , it 's not clear that is so much less democratic .
, do n't know
part of me rebels against that but
you start thinking about it
and some people do n't vote ,
they are
or what happens ,
you do n't vote
that is interesting .
have people here that
think and
they do n't vote
that 's how i feel .
and you can say something
feel if what 's coming to you but
that 's right ,
certainly and that is , in
one that 's true for
the population of feeling that way , but as
they do n't like him , and he
think it 's too
it is sometimes a difficult choice .
you do n't feel as though you have much of a choice ,
it is
you have in candidate .
but that is not really a vote of course .
it does n't really gain anything .
it does n't really ,
, is it and so
, do n't know
but just because of a job opportunity
.
is interested
is not
not ,
just .
, quite really how that would work , have ,
you obliged to vote too
up until fairly recently in fact , it was vote for
and , is that you are obliged to vote .
, do n't know
part of me are wary
it be more of a duty
maybe they should ,
at least for their first three or four years
is that
certain privileges or come
do n't know
maybe it should go with a driver 's license .
actually
consider a privilege , not a right
that 's a privilege ,
it 's a privilege ,
most people think of it , but as a right .
people got very upset in other words if the government .
but it is actually
it is .
that is correct .
maybe it should be .
if you 're a felon ,
it 's taken away from you if you 're a felon .
they will take away your right to vote , under certain circumstances .
that 's right .
so we do n't have yet do we ,
'd be willing too as a question
have n't
a republic , not a democracy
votes for the issues and republic 's
in other words , .
and can protect against the tyranny of democracy ,
as you can have just because , you can have a tyranny of a single bad ruler or something
a very passionate , good argument for
in a fully democratic process the law
you do n't want to be the case that
if there is some minority that people do n't like because of racial hatred or something like that , the majority just simply can vote against them .
cases like that , and need be constrained
do n't
think we 've right now , with congress that sometimes
think they are looking after their own more than they 're looking after the good of the country actually preservation self
and , so they work on that job .
and they are all fools ,
of thing
somehow , as much as a person government , they are less corrupt if someone is n't
