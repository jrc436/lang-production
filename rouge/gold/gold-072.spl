what do you think about it ? 
how are we doing in recycling ? 
i think we need to do more . 
i know i need to do more . 
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up . 
but i have a hard time of separating my trash , and get all the cans from the paper , 
and i just have n't gotten that dedicated yet . 
and we try to do a lot 
but there 's still a lot more we can do . 
so i figured i might get me one of those because we do n't always read the newspaper . 
sometimes it just sits around for a while , 
i do n't get the paper every day , 
but that 's the extent of what i 've done . 
i 'd like to be able to do more . 
it 's not always convenient to do it . 
i can imagine what it 's like up there . 
i 'm not exactly sure where the can thing is , 
and then i put me a little five gallon bucket , 
and it 's just outside the garage door 
so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket . 
and it 's actually metal 
it 's not plastic . 
i did n't want to buy a plastic one . 
because those things would just snap . 
and they 're metal , 
but it was only seven dollars , 
not too bad . 
i 'd have to check into something like that , because we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here , 
but occasionally we have some around , 
but for other kind of cans , it 'd probably only take aluminum cans like that , do n't they . 
i do n't think it would crush steel cans , 
it 's pretty tough . 
so . i do n't know , 
i do n't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that , 
but , i need to look into it more , 
sometimes , even with the newspaper they say they 'll only take certain types of paper , 
they wo n't take paper that 's shiny , 
so does my husband , 
we do a lot of recycling out there . 
but that 's just now come on board . 
we 've been throwing paper out there away for years , 
and we 're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out . 
i 'm sure they 're probably doing that here some . 
i 'm sure they are . 
i think it 's necessary , 
i like it , 
i think it 's good that you see these boxes , cereal , 
they 're now starting to make the packages out of recycled paper , 
and i 've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper , 
and i think they 're just fine . 
i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work , 
it 's his birthday , 
we 're pretty good friends , 
and what it is is a recycled paper bag 
and it 's just got happy birthday printing on it , and a cute little phrase inside , 
and it 's just a paper bag 
and it 's really cute . 
but , i think we 're doing better and better all the time , 
i think we 're becoming more conscious because we just ca n't stick everything in landfills any more . 
there 's not going to be any room , shortly . 
i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere . 
but i think we 're getting better at it 
i think there 's quite a bit more we could do . 
girls , put that away . 
now . 
but , you 're right sometimes it does seem like it 's more trouble than what it would be worth . 
i just wish it was a little more convenient to do , 
seems like you 're so busy anyway , 
and then that 's just one more thing to have to worry about . 
it sure is . 
i think if the cities , locally they 'd get more programs going so that you could do that , it 'd make it a lot easier . 
i guess the schools will get into it , too , sooner or later . 
get the kids interested in it too . 
and we just do n't have any place to store those kind of cans . 
if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people they 'll save them for us , 
there 's no problem there . 
but what do you do with them in the meantime ? 
that 's right . 
i do n't want a garage full of cans . 
that 's right , 
who does . 
people do n't have room for that kind of stuff . 
they 're not prepared for it . 
things like that , they just get bugs in them . 
they do . 
the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get , 
that 's for sure . 
that 's right , 
i 'm pretty lazy about it right now . 
pick it up . 
myself . 
i need to get better at it . 
if we all try a little bit , a little bit goes a long way . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
if everybody tries to do just a little bit , and a little bit more then we 'll get there . 
that 's true . 
that 's right . 
thank you for talking to me . 
thank you for calling . 
no problem , 
take care .
