\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented an ACT-R model of language production capable of producing novel sentences and sentence fragments. It takes as input a set of words, having foreknowledge of both a larger set of words and the syntactic types those words can be. Then, it attempts to combine these words using the rules defined in CCG. The model has two modes, one where errors are measured over time (learnability) as the model attempts to produce a sentence that exists in the Switchboard corpus, and another where the plausibility of whatever the model did produce is measured. This allows us to ask a variety of interesting scientific questions of the model that previous studies have been unable to answer.
