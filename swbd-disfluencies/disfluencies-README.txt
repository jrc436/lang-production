

Dysfluencies removed:


- fillers such as uh, well  ("INTJ")
  Note: punctuation, as in "uh, uh" will remain, e.g. "uh, uh" -> ","
- editing terms such as "I mean"  ("PRN")
- some discourse markers like well, like, now, see, say, actually
  ("INTJ", "PRN")
- Asides (sentences within sentences)
- Restarts (reparandum is removed, repair remains)



Note:

There is a substantial number (>900) of typos (marked "TYPO") in the
corpus. These remain at this point, as they are not easily corrected.
