how you like new jersey ? 
it 's pretty good . 
you get closer to the coast here , 
i guess it 's fairly industrial ? 
but i 'm about thirty miles west of there 
so you have actually green trees such that you do n't notice that , that other part of new jersey exists . 
you go even a few miles out 
and you got farms and everything 
i do n't know about you , 
but i 've always considered automobiles to be , probably the prime contributor . 
there 's a lot of contributors , 
but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that . 
definitely . 
there are a large number of them on the road . 
they 're all going , 
and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair . 
a big issue is a lot of states do n't have a inspection law 
even where you do have the inspections the inspection is once a year . 
you get the car that 's in the accident 
and muffler falls off or something 
and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that . 
natural gas powered rather than gasoline . 
i 'm hoping that comes along quick . 
i was reading an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that 's going 
it is coming from cars , though . 
i think that 's a contributor definitely . 
go ahead . 
the third world countries are less industrial 
and they want to become industrial 
and that 's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is , that basically they do n't want to have to pay for our mistakes if that makes any sense . 
those are joining arguments , 
but i do n't know , 
that 's kind of an interesting situation there . 
so it 's kind of an interesting situation . 
it 's not a real good one actually . 
you also have the very close related thing of the rain forest destruction which is the main source of what 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants . 
you do n't get that source of cleansing anymore . 
have you been in big cities a long time ? 
i 've mostly been in the east coast , 
those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard , i would think . 
that 's one of the worst . 
but i 've been pretty lucky , 
and there , you can tell that it 's getting worse . 
there , it 's almost all automobiles because there 's not that much in the way of heavy industry that would be causing it . 
and there 's not that much in terms of public transportation down there . 
there is ,
