advice on son or daughter
need , rather in time with
would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hope to get out of college and what sort of college would meet best those needs
's see
went away to school
that was a strict requirement for me .
a person 's of school ,
they 'd have to consider where they can drive home when they needed to get home how expensive
's see
what was the question ,
what 's the criteria for picking a college ?
what advice would you give ?
what advice
by clear-cut one piece of the college campus advice is
stay in a dormitory if you can .
go to classes ,
talking to faculty members and students
the northern colleges very different than the southern colleges
the people different
you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you 're used to .
thinking in that
think so ?
but with you .
's see
what .
or if they decided to drop a course decided if they need another year , then they 'd have to get a loan to continue
from other sources and your willingness to work during the summer or part time , one
that 's right .
of that the responsibility
and they could work and earn money towards college .
a lot more financial aid
to a private school
and then maybe the parents could also pay a third
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is .
so , it 's not too far away ,
mine is
but it 's getting there ,
we can still definitely put away the money for college now .
they did not have a car at college
that 's , too .
my son 's certainly not
be here
did n't have a car in college
think it 's more a burden to provide for
think so too .
the ones do get taken advantage of
think it 's just trouble waiting to happen and
they did n't take and they did n't take a car
and they did n't take a refrigerator .
