fact this past weekend since
have wallpaper , up and
and it took me all weekend
the walls down , the wallpaper
and that have
took another day and then
just .
was the wall behind the paper
did you get good results ?
not really .
it looks so , bad
to either paper back over it
but it did n't cover it ?
it covered the spots pretty good
but it just did n't
we moved
and we 're getting a house ,
this dark paneling wood at
we went to one of the stores paint
and they just said you can get by ,
i
more or less .
half coats dozen it looks
it was just a real dark paneling wood type grain
and it was
and we put on
but because , it was really hard to cover
it was something like that ,
, we have n't done it when
because we to make the house look nice was trying to sell
the job was tougher than we thought considerably .
and they have got somebody with an estimate to come in
quoted it or something and
that 's an awful lot .
have you tried getting outside estimates to see it ?
not
now we have a company that come out and painted it when .
and it was fairly reasonable .
we have a brick house
if , it was like five hundred dollars .
that 's quite reasonable .
so that was n't too bad .
you tried
n't have
over the long way
this is not on the topic
but did finish it
and my wife took a piece of brick
and she wanted
it 's
and she took it
of paint the
a gallon of it
and it 's remarkable just how close it will match the paint ,
it and do it electronically .
so , did they do a good job ?
but it is .
you put your sample under this thing
and it 's remarkable really .
and then they wanted
it 's remarkable .
this look like this
that look like that
and if it 's all white , of course , you 're all right
have you have problems getting colors to match ?
fact we 've got ours
later or so it does n't match , and
it 's the very same type of paint and everything ,
what 's the solution then ?
have no idea
the whole thing
at least you 'll get very good at it ?
you could go back and painting , over the whole thing
an interesting topic that
'll do a little bit here and a little there just
we painted to the house ,
we painted
and it had
we did the wall one
they do n't do that in the newer houses now
the mold , everything is white .
everything is in a house new white .
white ,
we get to look like ours
luck .
we wound selling the house up .
it does ,
make the rooms look bigger
like it have in molding .
.
it makes the room and
's still white ,
the molding
white .
all the way around the room that , make it look very attractive
why they have everything white explains it
what about the
it did make a big difference ?
not particularly
because the house has so many windows
the living room have four good size
and of course , at night ,
we have a soccer field that 's about a hundred yards from our house
right at our house
we did n't know when we bought the house
do n't really
a lot of
to about three feet just the dark
and then we left it white above that
it did n't change
.
scrape but the interesting thing is some of that away
you have to do that very , very carefully .
and it takes a long time ,
that 's right .
you can work yourself to death .
so good over the weekend
it 's kind of frustrating .
it is .
a lot of work
a lot of work .
go to a meeting
it 's been good talking .
to you .
