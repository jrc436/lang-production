are
's
where
this is quite a long distance .
it certainly is .
do you have any pets ?
use too
none but right now .
you do n't have
you get
live in an apartment building
and , it 's just not feasible .
'd love to have a dog
what is she ?
, it acquired and
had she
and she told me that even .
of weeks a
for .
and she 's been a lot of company .
she 's however , getting a little old
things starting to fail
live now
while she and all day stay in the house
and she 's been pretty well holding herself .
a little on the floor
but she 's usually pretty good .
such a difference for her
she 's had it for three years now .
possibly four .
really such a difference for her but .
's a disabled person
's unable to
would certainly have one and if that was n't so
that does n't require much attention
's not typically a cat person
have on occasion brought her cat over for me to keep from time to time
and this cat 's
and it would
it 's just a great cat ,
my personal preference is a dog .
would ever want a cat
like
just would n't want to own one
they 're
you do n't
do n't know ,
with my dog with can
or they , with their presence grant you
we 're supposed to appreciate them .
do n't know a cat would do that
used to have , a cat that could read better than any human being in my life me
could just walk in the door
and she know whether to come up quietly or just run and knock over me .
walked in the door
it was
know when she 's not feeling good too
she 's not doing it on purpose
when she was younger , she used to do that to get even with me ,
and some people might not believe
but , .
something and you make sure to can get to its litter box this cat
for some reason during the night , the door was quite wide not enough for it to get through
decided it and the next morning
've got your attention now ?
animals have a way of talking .
tell
'd trade my dog in for the world
ago she got sick on me
and took her to the vet 's because she was eating n't and she was able to jump n't
she lost all her activity
and she stayed there for one day
she had a low white cell count
took so his suggestion
and took the dog to the hospital dog there
and they said they 'd keep her for three days there .
she ended .
it cost me over five hundred dollars .
plus the vet sent me for what he did a bill
then .
of years a
and then she got sick again on me
and brought her to a different vet this time
had given her and everything
and he gave me the last time
was and
and she 's been okay every since .
it 's been about two years now .
that 's great ,
it really is .
so the second time
what do you want to do ?
of course , you would .
know until it 's all over
and the cat got sick .
so she took the cat to the vet
and she had the cat there for two days
and then the cat died .
and so the doctor said
you this bill and
me bury the cat
so , it cost her three hundred dollars ,
and she did n't get the cat back .
so
they pay for all the medical bills that the cat ran up plus the expenses burial
and she just brought the cat in because he was n't feeling good .
so that was kind of a surprise
you kind of wonder what really happened .
they claimed they did the best they could have
and then the cat died .
're looking for another cat for them
that will make their day .
think it will
think
only work
anyway for

it 's been a pleasure talking .

and you take care .
