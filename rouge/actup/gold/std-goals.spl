first i need to know how do you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home ? 
of course , it 's one of the last few things in the world you 'd ever want to do unless it 's just really for their own good . 
i 'd be very very careful checking them out . 
she had a rather massive stroke about eight months ago . 
and i was fortunate in that i was personally acquainted with the people who ran the nursing home in our little hometown . 
so , i was very comfortable in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it . 
i had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and could not take care of herself anymore , was confined to a nursing home for a while 
that was really not a very good experience . 
it had to be done in a hurry . 
we did n't have six months to check all of these places out . 
and it was really not very good deal . 
we were not really happy with , nursing home that we finally had . 
and she was able to return to her apartment again . 
is there something else we could have done in checking out all the places that might be available . 
of course there 's not one on every corner , especially smaller areas , smaller towns . 
probably the hardest thing in my family my grandmother , she had to be put in a nursing home 
and she had a fall 
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house . 
then she lived in an apartment 
and that was even harder actually . 
because it was just a change of location 
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling . 
she had children all across the united states 
and she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children . 
and that was pretty heart-rending for her . 
i can imagine . 
that 's tough . 
that 's tough . 
for somebody who for most of their life has , not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm , ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines . 
and facing that situation , it 's quite a dilemma . 
go ahead . 
all the brothers and sisters got together 
and they actually had a conference . 
that 's great . 
and it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family , getting down together and doing that . 
that 's right . 
and just the children were involved in the decision , because it involved just them . and , making that decision and then finding a place 
and everybody had duties to perform . 
whether it was just giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot , of the decision making like finding a proper nursing home . 
you were very , fortunate . 
i know . 
and they had seen it coming . 
i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like , that for me . 
unfortunately , a lot of times responsibilities like that seem to fall to maybe one child in the whole family . 
and it 's usually not a very smooth thing . 
i was lucky too that i only have one brother . 
my mother also was very independent . 
we were lucky in one respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't really much aware of what was going on . 
that nursing home life would not have been anything of her choosing , 
of course , she would not have been happy there at all . 
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us . 
she was very well aware 
and her daughter came and visited her 
at least her daughter , came and visited her 
and also her several grandchildren , came and visited her every day . 
that 's great . 
it was more of a relief for her . 
but she was truly aware . 
that would be tough . 
and i think that one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it was n't necessarily the quantity of care but the quality of , care . 
that the people that worked there were very interested , to make it as close , as possible . 
i think , for myself i see that as probably what everything would hinge upon . 
how close is it to a home environment . 
that 's right . 
that 's probably the major question . 
i think that great strides are being made nowadays in caring for the elderly in a whole lot of areas . 
just people are , of course , populations getting older . 
matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families . 
but , i guess as we become more industrialized and less in a rural situation we choose not to deal with the , extended family because we feel it 's kind of cumbersome , when in reality it makes things much much easier . 
that 's right . 
and , things are scattered so much nowadays . 
i think that perhaps the extended family it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care . 
just because they 're grandparents . 
they raised us after all . 
but i think that i 've had a lot of good experiences with many people especially where they 've had extended family . 
money seems to be too big of an issue . with what 's going on today 
realistically it is . 
and i think that may be , perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem . 
that would , certainly help . 
we may not have as high a standard of living 
that 's just a matter of defining priorities or some priorities anyway . 
i think you 're right . 
i guess that was it . 
it was good talking to you . 
take care . 
what did you wear to work today ? 
let 's see . 
what did i wear to work today ? 
so , can you dress pretty casually ? 
on occasion . on occasion . 
i do vary . 
i wear suits , 
i wear skirts and sweaters . 
on occasion i can wear jeans . 
how about you ? 
i run a business out of my home . 
then whenever i have a meeting with a client , i 'll put a suit on . and then come home and get back into regular clothes again . 
there 's no real dress code where i work . 
i do n't like to wear heels , 
that really tires me out . 
i work in a big building . 
so , i predominantly wear flat shoes . 
in the winter i wear sweaters , 
in summer i like one piece dresses , short sleeves , things like that . 
i can only have a limited wardrobe , since i 'm only , working part-time right now . 
but still , it gives it some variety . 
accessories , 
what about your casual wear ? 
do you like to wear jeans most of the time ? 
mostly . 
it 's nice you can wear shorts , especially on a day like today when it 's so hot . 
dress shorts . 
and i get really a lot of compliments on them . 
where i work is predominantly male . 
suits or slacks jeans , whatever . 
but i 'm really the only woman at work that does that , 
but seems to work for me . 
it 's shorts 
but it looks like a skirt . 
so , i think that 'll be good for work , too . 
it 'll be comfortable . 
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit . 
and i have a closet full of sweaters . 
that 's interesting . 
but i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses . 
i 'd like to be able to wear those here . 
needless to say , my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now . 
today was definitely a shorts day around here . 
we 're still pretty much in winter , as far as that goes here . 
it feels good , 
it 's nice to get , out and about . 
i guess we 've discussed everything there is about clothing . 
sounds good . 
it was nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you , also . 
have you seen dancing with wolves ? 
i 've seen that , 
that was a really good movie . 
probably one of the best things about it was the scenery 
and i thought the story was pretty good , too . 
have you ever lived in that part of the country ? 
i have n't . 
have you ever visited it ? 
could be . 
have you been up to that ? 
apparently it 's going to win everything . 
that 's true . 
i agree with that . 
i think it 's been nominated for twelve awards 
so , it has surprised everybody . 
the interesting thing is i had heard that , 
and i tend to overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it 's that great . 
and the thing is , it was a good story . 
and i guess that 's what i really like . 
although , i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour . 
did you ? 
have you seen sleeping with the enemy ? 
i 've heard that 's really great , though . 
you have to go see that one . 
go . 
you must really keep up . 
i do . 
i go every weekend . 
those are two definite must see movies , i think . 
is it a terror movie 
there 's not really any blood and guts in it or anything like that . 
it 's more suspense . 
it 's pretty graphic at points . 
but i think they 're both excellent movies . 
do you know who he is ? 
he 's the movie critic . 
and he has a talk show on the , k l i f . 
anyway , it 's on from seven to nine , or something . 
and people call in 
if you keep up with movies , it 's kind of interesting . 
there 's a certain a mount of dribble that they do . 
they 've got a couple of kids , ten or twelve years old , 
and they call in 
and they review movies . 
it 's interesting . 
you listen to him 
and then you go watch the movie . 
it 's interesting , though , 
the difficulty with dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that , and you produce it , and then you star in it the question is , did he really know it was going to be good 
or did he just do it ? 
his heart was in it , 
but i do n't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was . 
i think it was something that he really wanted to do . 
he wanted to direct it , 
he wanted to star in it . 
he enjoyed the story line 
and i think he really wanted it . 
and whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office , i think he would have been happy . 
because i think he did a good job 
do you know who the guy was that was playing the wagon driver ? 
a little piece of trivia . 
the guy when he first headed out from the army post . 
who , 
i do n't know who that guy is . 
he does ? 
as a recurring character every week ? 
can you , believe that ? 
i 'd a never put those two together . 
that 's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said , 
did you notice that ? 
i thought , , 
it 's really funny . 
you think back , 
and 
and it was really funny that he winds up playing in the movie . 
it was a lot of fun . 
i do n't know how long this conversation is supposed to go 
but we 're at about five minutes . 
i should think we 've done enough . 
you think so ? 
i have n't been watching my watch . 
i guess , 
does it usually cut off ? 
is that what , it does ? 
i do n't know . 
why do we end this thing ? 
it used to just automatically cut off 
i think it just says hang up . 
so , i guess so . 
why do n't we do that ? 
the first thing for me is i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is , 
if an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state , that 's one thing , 
and the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me , and very much everyday in this country , 
but in the second time , at least overtly where someone comes in and finds out information about you that should be private does not seem obviously , everyday . 
i think i agree with that . 
and then i realize , this is something i solicited , 
that 's right . 
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion 
but after that i realized , i really wanted this 
and it was sort of exciting 
it turned out to be an invitation . 
and at the same time i think that i receive on the order of probably , seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it . 
from personal parties or from these phone commercial things . 
commercial , solicitations primarily . 
that 's a remarkable number . 
i get them rarely 
and i 'm still astounded that one , they let anyone do them and two , that they have any effect in this whatsoever . 
i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say , 
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there 's not even a person there . 
and i think that 's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control 
and one 's feeling obligated , because of some sense of the way the ritual is played out . 
and , that then ends up being the most common example for me . 
i guess i 'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised . 
and i do n't think i would have thought about that . 
i think that 's a good idea on your part . 
presumably those who find out such information , if they are doing it , i would prefer not to be known , 
so there 's , , things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it , 
and i ca n't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia . 
and , i 'd like to think that it 's quite low , at least in this country . 
and i 'm not feeling invaded 
then maybe my privacy has n't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded . 
if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something you do n't know about it then i guess one could assume one was invaded 
but i do n't feel invaded by it . 
i do n't , have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things , 
i 'm not sure why . 
i guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts 
and if someone finds out something about me that is true , i do n't have a sense of loss from that . 
you must have a relatively clean conscience then . 
more harmed or something . 
because , you do n't have anyway to turn it off . 
i did . 
i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it . 
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there . 
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern , for instance , that i would have thought to be private . 
but then if it turns out to generate incorrect things , that 's even worse 
they had you pegged . 
and the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money 
and then all of , a sudden you get your thirty a week because now , they 're advertising you . 
they said they would give it out to only select companies just like software is only given out to customers , 
you ca n't believe that . 
it would be pirated 
and they would n't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who 's offering full cash price , for it . 
you ca n't tell it , what a company really has to do with it 
and there 's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone , any hacker being able to know what your income is , what your spending habits are , 
and that hacker just has to get in touch with the sneak thief 
and suddenly what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home . 
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling , threatened as a result of it 
so , maybe that is a little bit of what privacy is . 
i also thought about it waiting to talk to you that , another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there is n't . 
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy . 
and i realize that , i can take that for granted 
and things are quite different there in terms of that . 
there 's less of a sense of privacy . 
that 's interesting . 
but no concept for wanting to be private . 
it 's generally being alone is not a very desirable state , at least officially . 
doors do n't have latches on them . 
people do n't tend to knock , 
if there 's a door closed and you open it because it 's in your way 
people walk in out 
it very much is . 
and people would leave , me alone . 
people start paying attention to you very much 
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms . 
which is n't always the case in all cultures , 
that is true . 
i have n't thought about that 
and that it 's fascinating to think a lot of someone who does n't know how to say private . 
i wonder how people have sex , and things like that , 
and the results of sex are quite obvious , , as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years . 
there 's hope , 
because anyone can be alone for some period of time 
but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect . 
and if that 's gone i really do n't know how to live very well , 
and i really do wonder how people do that . 
that 's interesting . 
are there any other specific things where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency ? 
and there 's that sense of , i have now opened my door 
and they 're doing something that normally i really only invite , people to . 
because , any friend , anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me , 
but no one is just welcome to come by my house . 
so that is more of a sense of invasion . 
have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list 
and they 're either offering a service 
or they 're introducing some new product in the area 
and normally when they call , you 're either in the shower , 
or you 're in the middle of cooking something 
and you have to stop everything to run to the phone . 
is that one that you 're talking about . 
that was the big one i 'm talking about . 
i work weird hours , 
and invariably just about the time , i 'm going to sleep , the phone tears off the wall . 
and you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone , 
as soon as you say hello , you hear the click of the recording coming on , 
or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already . 
that 's true , 
or the ones that are generated by a computer . 
it 's just a computer voice that comes on the line . 
those are the ones that i really , really hate too . 
i 've even had some of them , 
they 're voice activated 
and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything . 
sometimes i get them on my answering machine at home 
and i hate that when i 've got a whole bunch of messages 
and i go through them 
and most of them are n't from anybody at all . 
we 've got a thing in this country , 
you can have your phone number unlisted , 
but if they 're going to offer these services , or these recorded message , everything , they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them . 
i have an unlisted telephone number , 
but i still get all of those calls 
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i do n't even understand . 
so 
i do , 
i really feel that 's an invasion of my privacy . 
i agree with you on that particular subject there . 
let me see . 
that 's about , that as far as any other everyday occurrences , 
i put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door , either religious groups , or people peddling products . 
if i wanted their products , i would have either gone to the store to bought it , 
or i would have called for their salesman to come out . 
that 's true . 
living in an apartment complex though you ca n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations , 
but they still come up to the front door and walk around . 
so , usually what i do is i 'll call the apartment manager and tell them there 's people coming around , 
and they 're trying to sell something 
or they 're from a religious organization 
and i really hate that . 
i really , really do . 
i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago 
it was n't even what i would consider family hours , 
and i do n't particularly care for it , 
so i especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me . 
i agree with their right to pursue their religion of choice , in whatever manner they want to , 
i 'm on my turf , 
if i want them there , i 'll call for them , 
otherwise , i do n't want to know they exist . 
i agree with you there . 
if they want to choose that particular religion that 's fine with me too as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in . 
and i do n't like the way that they do it either , 
and , it 's their mission that they do it . 
they go door to door 
and they go out into the public 
and they actually have the teenagers serving two years in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work 
and i do n't know , 
i just do n't particularly care for that at all . 
and that 's one thing that i feel really strongly about though , is people coming up to my door , and especially religious organizations and wanting to try and get me to join or become interested in their religion , 
because i have my own . 
the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting , 
i 've got a storm door on the front of the house 
i do n't know how much clearer it can be , 
it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting . 
that 's true , 
i did n't go that far 
but 
i probably could do the same thing , 
i do n't have a storm door , 
but i do n't think that that would stop people . 
it 's like they see that word 
and it says go , instead of stop . 
that would be technically illegal , 
it would be harassment . 
but , i consider an invasion of my privacy , a harassment in itself . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
what else ? 
i believe we 've pretty much summed everything up . 
i know , 
but i remember you talked about something , 
you started off and said , 
let me think , 
you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door . 
you said something else . 
i ca n't remember what it was , 
that kind of touched a nerve right there , 
but we got to talking about the people coming to you at the front door . 
i 'm drawing a blank . 
is our five minutes up ? 
pretty close to it . 
pretty close . 
i 've enjoyed talking with you . 
and take it easy . 
thanks , 
i got a call yesterday too . 
this is a different subject though . 
there 's really a lot , is n't there . 
i think there really is . 
it 's kind of an easy thing to talk about . 
i think you have to push one 
and then we can start recording it . 
are you ready now ? 
like i said i guess it would be the work force as far as changes in the generations . 
i know because , i know when my mother was going into the work force there was n't very many opportunities for her , 
you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids 
and i 've never faced that at all . 
i think now , you go to work when they 're six weeks old , 
and you stay there . 
and i feel like the next generation , you 'll probably just work right along with your husband . 
i think it 's definitely gotten better . 
i do to , 
much . 
and it 's just going to get better . 
it really is . 
because women are in every field now , 
i ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in . 
i ca n't either , 
not a one . 
i do n't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing . 
hopefully , the next generation , it wo n't even be an issue , 
people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman , 
i think that would be the best goal . 
i do too , 
just your qualifications 
and that would be it . 
exactly , 
not what color you are , how old you are , what you 're male or female . 
that would be wonderful , 
i guess it 's kind of an ideal world though . 
i kind of think , maybe in time , that you 'll go by social security numbers , 
and that way they ca n't say they picked a male over a female , female over a male , 
or the way you look , 
your age or anything . 
i think that would be a wonderful way to do it . 
i do to 
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that you have . 
also , with women in the work force they 've gotten a lot more options as far as job sharing . 
as a matter of fact , that 's what i 'm doing . 
is it . 
it sure is . 
that would be great . 
it sure is . 
and we could send her messages , 
and she kept in touch like that , and basically , just worked out of her house . 
i would just take her the actual paperwork once every week or two , 
and that worked out great too . 
and that 's a real attractive option , if you have the technology for it . 
and she was like she was sitting in the office , 
so i think that 's real nice too , to come up with different options . 
do you like the job sharing ? 
i do , 
do you ? 
i really do , 
i think it 's great . 
one week she 'll work three days and i 'll work two 
and the next week i 'll work three and she 'll work two , 
that 's great , 
and we just share off like that . 
do you get the full benefits ? 
we get the full benefits . 
that 's wonderful . 
but we 've just really got a wonderful system that we 're working under . 
especially with children , and so many things going on , that would be great . 
it really is , 
and that way we 're not really missing any thing out of children , 
you have your career and your home life , 
and that would be a nice way , especially if you have young children . 
it is , 
it is , 
both of ours is school age , 
my son 's just in day-care 
but even that they have extracurricular activities 
and the older they get the more that you 're involved in that . 
i think it 's great , 
and i look for more of that in the next generation . 
when that subject comes up they can say yes , 
that would be wonderful . 
i do too . 
plus , i bet it cuts down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything , 
so you do n't have to unless you 're just really sick , or the child 's sick . 
most of the time now it 's just the weekend , 
or just forget it . 
or , what i 've done is found doctors ' and dentists ' office with extended hours . 
that 's been real helpful too , 
so that 's real helpful , 
so you do n't have to do it during office hours , run out on your lunch hour . 
it 's always been that way . 
she always worked , 
but it was n't that easy for her to just take off . 
and i know she probably did n't make hardly anything compared to the work that she did . 
i think there is still some discrimination there where men and women work in the same job , 
i think men get paid more , 
i do too . 
but i think that 's improving . 
it 's such a slow process 
it 's frustrating , 
but , you can see that it 's wrong 
and you just want to make it right , 
but at least the wheels are moving forward . 
they really are . 
i think it 's getting better , not worse . 
i should probably get back to my job . 
i know , 
i know the feeling . 
call again . 
i sure will . 
particularly what kind of music do you like ? 
i mostly listen to popular music . 
i listen to it all the time in my car , 
so , i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i do n't like commercials . 
but i find myself listening to popular music , 
and quite honestly , , i have some little children 
but that 's not by my choice . 
how about you ? 
i do n't have that , experience to share . 
lucky you . 
i switch the stations a lot because i do n't have a cassette player in my car . 
however , i do like a lot of different forms of music 
so i switch quite often . 
i 'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to . 
there 's such a wide selection , 
i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music . 
if it is performed correctly or if it 's done right , or if the version is done right , i like it , 
but , if it 's not , then i wo n't . 
i really do n't , 
how do you feel about rap music ? 
rap . 
it seems to be so popular these days . 
i do n't really have anything against rap music . 
the one thing i do object to about rap music is when it becomes militant , or , if it 's violence oriented . 
i have strong objections to that . 
when it was really just starting . 
when it was just starting , i heard what was called talking blues , which actually is rap . 
and , it was incredible the parallel between it and rap . 
and you listen a lot , 
if you hear a lot of old gospel especially the black gospel . you can really pick it up , 
it seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music . 
a lot of times you 'll hear songs that you know , they 're not original , but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm . 
and it sounds so much different 
and yet , i have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music 
and she thinks it 's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she 's listening to , 
and yet , she thought they were brand new , original pieces . 
they do cover versions of , standards . 
that 's right . 
i think it 's kind of absurd the fact that they do n't really give the original artist , or the original composer , the credit that is really due to them . 
seems to be the hot one of today . 
he used wild thing . 
do you remember that song . 
i ca n't remember who the artist was on that . 
who ? 
maybe it was n't that one . 
because , it was a living person that i 'm thinking of that said , `` , those are my words . '' 
because they had n't originally gotten permission , from him to use it . 
and , he since then has amended that , and paid them his royalties every time the song goes on 
i do n't know 
maybe so . 
i , ca n't think . 
it was really old . 
there are so many different songs , 
i 'm i do n't want to listen to this . 
that was really great . 
that was a really good piece of work , 
and then when you hear the cover it 's what are they doing . 
they destroyed it . 
and i thought it was hideous . 
i did too . 
i did n't like that either . 
he was a phenomenon , 
there was no reason for him to really come into great stardom or anything . 
i think it was in high school . 
i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer . 
he was very good . 
hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like . 
i was really into the album oriented music , even then , 
and i 'm you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
you can only laugh . 
i guess i can just humor them at this point . 
i guess our age is showing when , we think that . 
but i 've liked a lot of the new music . 
and then i do n't know 
it 's in a very weird position right now . 
i like things like to hear what they call world music . which is using all these natural forms of music 
really that 's not world music . 
what do you mean by world music ? 
a lot of where they make music that they adapt to another type of listener . 
and , then when they hear it , it 's another form of music , 
and sort of trying to draw out the best sources . 
the best of every type of music . 
there are some types of heavy metal that i really like , 
but i would n't say that i completely like heavy metal . 
world music takes the forms that have really been the cream of the crop , , 
so then it becomes a kind of music of its own , so to speak , 
it becomes a kind of music of its own . 
but , they 're trying to make it somewhat more modern . 
he 's a jazz performer , 
we 're going to have to get off . 
are they trying to , 
i do n't know . 
we 've talked our five minutes though . 
but when i heard his album , i heard it and it was just incredible . 
i 've been listening to that a lot lately . 
i listened 
and then you hear the muted trumpet . 
me , 
and you never would think that they can actually play together 
we started out keeping a budget about two years , ago , 
we have a computer , here at the house , 
and then basically since then what i 've done is keep track of it through the checkbook 
because our house payment is once a month , 
that 's our biggest expense 
so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck , even thought it 's really still there , so that i can keep good balance , a running total through the month , 
a running total . 
what do you all do ? 
we 've , taken how much we have write down how much we have coming in each month 
at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend . 
we made up different accounts , 
we 've set a budget for each household expenses , or food , and clothing and entertainment and then our own fun money and just stuff like that 
and then each time we spend something , we write down in a book 
we try to stay within a certain budget , 
is it hard to keep track of it 
or does it work out pretty well ? 
it takes some dedication to do it , 
but it works out real well , 
and you 're staying within your budget 
and everything is working pretty good . 
i have to stay within it , 
if something comes up and you ca n't stay within it then we have a budget for we call our slush fund or something 
and an unexpected comes up , then you do n't feel so strapped . 
you do n't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that . 
because we do n't charge anything that we ca n't pay off by the end of the month . 
that 's a good choice , 
we 're trying to do that this year . 
we 've taken that this year , and said we 're going to pay off all of our credit cards 
you 've got paper under your table . 
and we have another loan with the bank , 
and so we hope by the end of this year , that by doing that we 'll be free , and clear . 
to be out of that . 
free . 
the only thing we have , to pay off is a automobile loan and our house payment , 
that 's good to be in that kind of shape . 
we try to stay out of debt . 
what are you all trying to do long term . 
. it 's long term . 
and we just have our life insurance for right now . 
so , we do n't have any long term in stocks , or anything like that right now , 
or so much a pay check 
and then they match it . 
that 's what we 're doing . 
so that 's worked out pretty good 
when i retired from there , or left , i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an i r a 
and we had an existing i r a 
so both of us have some money in an i r a that we 're also trying to figure , 
we 're putting it in c d 's right now , 
and then we 're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund . 
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a c d for a while 
and then if we need it we wait until it 's expired 
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and what our goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement , kids college , paying off the house , buying a different house special thing , buying land and building our own house 
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at , and then gave us some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals , or not , and what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and the money we could put in at what time . 
or not , 
that sounds interesting , 
our life insurance guy has come out , 
and he 's determined how much we need if something were to happen . 
that 's the other financial thing i guess that we 've done with our life insurance since i 'm at home now is figuring out what we would need if something happened to my husband , or what he would need if something happened to me , 
that 's a big thing to think about . 
, 
i would sell the house and move back home to my home town , 
so i do n't know what he would do . 
i guess that 's most of my financial plans right now . 
mine too . 
is there anything you 'd like to add ? 
that 's about all for mine . 
it 's been nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you too . 
wonderful touch tone telephone there . 
what kind of books do you enjoy reading ? 
therefore , my reading pleasures are quite wide . 
i 've read that one too . 
i only had a subscription once , 
but my mother always gave me hers 
absolutely , it 's great the way that it 's broken out and you can set up little trips and day trips and things . 
it 's pretty neat . 
i like photography magazines . 
i do n't take a subscription or anything like that . 
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of , building magazines and plant engineering magazines and , read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines 
how about yourself ? 
i have an interest in art , 
so i , frequently purchase and read books , mainly on water color because that 's my big interest at the moment . 
that 's great . 
and i guess i like a variety of things lots of fiction type books . 
that 's fairly interesting . 
i bet that would be , rather interesting . 
that 's self improvement , 
that 's kind of a hobby 
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing . 
i do n't know that i read anything strictly labeled self improvement . 
how about you ? 
i do . 
we have these classes we attend management classes 
and they give you books 
one of its great slogans is if you 're not serving the customer , you better be serving someone who is . 
so that 's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is 
and as you probably well know , all of us are our own customer . 
you 're my customer , i 'm your customer , sort of thing . 
maybe i am into some things occasionally that i do n't think of in terms of self improvement . 
they are 
but i do n't label it as such . 
like what for example . 
i do n't know , 
i have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them , but not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , 
so those are self improvements . 
and it 's a very layman 's approach towards managing different types of people . 
and the very last chapter is how to manage engineers . 
so it 's interesting , 
here again it 's casual reading 
and it 's not eaten up with a lot of mechanical stuff 
and it 's really excellent fast reading 
i do n't know , 
that 's a little heavy for me . 
they 're hard to set down because it 's so interesting 
but they 're always challenging to get through one of them . 
i have a hard time finishing books . 
i guess i also have been reading a lot of things on quality improvement and that type of thing because that 's what i 'm involved in a lot at work . 
but i think sometimes the word is a little over used 
exactly right . 
i think we name drop it a little too much and do n't fully understand what it is we 're saying . 
i think it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk 
and all that kind of rolls in together there , 
but that 's just kind of part of it . 
any other comments . 
not that i can think of . 
i think i 'm under my quota a little bit . 
i need to probably make a phone call or two . 
we just started , 
this is true . 
i 've enjoyed it . 
you too , 
and . 
have a good day . 
i do n't know about you 
but where i am we have an extremely lax dress policy at work 
and it varies every day from jeans one day to business suits the next . 
it 's pretty bad , 
but it 's true , 
they tend to try to be real lax 
and supposedly the policy is like we , hire these wonderful creative people 
we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want . 
and you really will see people in jeans one day and business suits the next . 
i 'm kind of that way too . 
i work in the legal department 
and where we are now , what we 're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents . 
and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day , 
it always seems like i 'm doing that 
and i ca n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry boxes of documents around , 
so , if i 'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents , i dress down . 
but if we 're going to have a meeting , where we 're having the attorneys come in , or other party 's attorneys and stuff , then i normally dress up . 
and i 'll wear a dress and hose and stuff . 
we 're kind of that way too . 
i 'm the same way you are , 
i kind of try to judge from day to day . 
i know where i am we work a lot with the customers 
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time 
and , if i know that they 're going to be there i try to really watch it and like you say really dress up 
i 've been doing a lot of reorganization the last couple of months the same way you are , 
and it 's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
it is 
as a matter of fact , i thought i had one funny story 
we had them in the warehouse , 
and at that point , the warehouse was over across the road 
and it was n't air conditioned , 
and , we were there in the middle of the summer , 
it was dusty and dirty , 
there was a fan at the very end of the row 
and that was it . 
we wore shorts . 
we did n't know that was a big no , no . 
and the supervisor from another area came up to us 
and this area where record retention is , there 's only a few people that work there , 
and he knew who worked there , 
and he came up to us 
and he just said , who 's your supervisor . 
he called our supervisor and our supervisor 's supervisor , 
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities , complaining that we were wearing shorts . 
he did n't at least say to us , did you know you 're not supposed to do that . 
we ended up getting called out on it . 
how awful . 
it sounds like mister power hungry . 
and i do n't care , 
you can call them split skirts 
but these were shorts . 
that 's all they were . 
i do n't care what else you call them , 
if they 're below the knee 
maybe you can call them split skirts . 
if they 're above the knee they turn into shorts . 
and these were n't even really full ones . 
they had a problem out here with it last summer , wearing these shorts that were the real wide full ones , 
and these were n't even those . 
these were pretty short , black , 
the were black velvet shorts 
and she had on black hose and black heels 
and she looked very , very nice . 
but , you do n't wear shorts to work . 
as far as i 'm considered , she was in violation 
and nobody says anything to them . 
the management does n't ever seem to want to cut off that this is wear we 're going to draw the line . 
this is shorts . 
and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that , 
so , it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going , we have a pair of those at home too . 
it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear , 
and they have said no . 
just because you put on a pair of hose with them does n't make them not shorts anymore . 
i 've never seen them do it without hose , 
they always have hose on , 
but still , they 're shorts , 
i do n't care what you say , 
they 're shorts . 
i did n't know that e d s has a very strict dress code , 
i had a friend , 
do they really ? 
i had a friend who worked there for a year or so 
and they spell it out . 
it is definitely lined out . 
women are not allowed to wear slacks , 
you wear coordinated suits . 
i could n't afford to work there . 
and a particular kind of shoe so high heel , 
it is spelled out . 
when i was looking at her materials when she first started she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff . 
and it told about the dress code 
i know , that 's it . 
and e d s is very particular about this , hair cuts , 
i do n't know that that would be a good environment to work in . 
i see , 
i do n't know about anybody else , 
and a lot of bosses may say i 'm nuts , 
but i am more productive when i 'm in pants . 
i am . 
i work faster , 
i get things done faster , than when i 'm in a dress and heels , 
and it 's weird 
but i can get so much more done if i 'm dressed comfortable . 
and she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse 
but she really did n't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse , but the warehouse . 
and she came with skirts , just like she 'd be going into the office . 
and we 'd try to say , did n't you bring any pants or anything . 
we 're out here in the warehouse , 
she was so hot and miserable in the skirt . 
you ca n't do that in a skirt poor soul . 
she finally tried to go buy a pair of pants 
but it was just completely miserable for her . 
that 's terrible , 
that 's terrible 
i do n't know , 
i just figure , 
sometimes i worry about if i go in in pants , 
and i never ever , ever , ever go in in a pair of jeans . 
but i 'll go in in pants . 
and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that will hold you back if you do n't dress in your dress for success business suits everyday if upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on , 
but i do n't know if they do or not . 
i see a lot of the managers 
and they 're in jeans , 
we have assistants to the general counsel 
and it 's funny 
because , there 's one that always wears a suit . 
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it . 
and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes 
is n't that funny . 
. we 've kind of had a variety there 
that 's great . 
but , i think a lot of times it 's mainly who they 're going to meet with , 
or they 're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that 's how they are . 
and they 're usually casual . 
that 's the smart way to do it . 
when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down , if they come in , in a six hundred dollar three piece suit , it 's going to make the people they 're meeting with feel very uncomfortable , 
or it would me . 
look at this slick guy , 
i wonder what kind of money does he make , 
i can see it now . 
it was good to talk to you . 
it was really enjoyable . 
this is kind of a fun project . 
it really is . 
i 've done some of the other speech programs , 
but we 've never got to talk to another person , 
it was always just talking to the computer . 
so this is a little different . 
it 's kind of enjoyable , 
i 'm really looking forward to it . 
a lot . 
how has it been this week for you ? 
damp , cold , warm . 
damp . 
we have gone through , what might be called the four seasons in the last week . 
i do n't even want to tell you what ours has been like then . 
i heard about that . 
and we set a record yesterday . 
but then today the wind has dropped off , and also , the temperature , 
so , very cool 
or it feels cool compared to yesterday , but very pleasant , 
no rain in the last month , i do n't think . 
the ground 's very dry 
so our yard work is pretty tough , the ground being dry , 
but i guess it also brings about allergies , 
we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now . 
everything blooming , 
and the weather . 
and i think a lot of people have contracted spring fever too , 
. had a lot of people out at work for fishing and golfing , reasons and things like that . 
the blue flu , 
the blue flu , or the white collar flu , depending on where you work . 
as i 've said , we have had variable weather . , 
and , also , we have a lot of green , 
the grass has been growing 
and if you look outside , you would like to go out and mow your lawn , if you could go out and buy a new spark plug , or something along those lines , 
and you do not have to go out and buy the spark plug . 
but , we 've had an unusually warm spring , 
and i guess we 're still in winter , 
and we have had no snow . 
no snow ? 
to speak of . 
we usually average anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter 
and this year , as well as last year , we have had less than four inches total accumulation . 
so in that regard , it 's fine , 
it is . 
down in the more southern and western areas . 
and , of course we are about two hours from the northern border , straight south , 
it does , 
very seldom , if any , 
and it was that way every day . 
so , that you became accustomed to it . 
but otherwise as i said , we have had a relatively mild winter , speaking for this area of the country . 
i 've lived there for eight years myself . 
but , i did n't . . 
you are not from that area originally , i can tell . 
very much , 
very much , 
you 've moved around as much as i have . 
my father was in the air force , 
i see . 
i worked for the government , 
but i guess this is my first conversation in this series . 
i had not received my personal identification number . 
i 'm not sure how long we 're supposed to talk . 
it 's just as long as you want to . 
it 's just as long as you want to , and just a reasonable lengthy conversation . 
i do not . 
and , i was sent an application from jack . 
i 've known jack for some time . 
i 'm in the speech processing business , and have been for a number of years , 
so i was very much interested , in being a speaker for this . 
and i 'm an environmental engineer , 
i see . 
and they just published this internally getting people involved . 
that 's really strange . 
i 'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area . if just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative , 
but i have been a speaker in other similar type of activities . 
and , i know the reason why this is being gathered and the program and so forth , 
so , as i said , i was interested in being a speaker . 
we have n't talked much about the weather . 
i know that 's what we 're supposed to do . 
let 's see , 
i was looking at it , 
i was trying to find out speedy short cuts , 
and i always thought it 's not necessary to measure your time , just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation , and , end it when needed . 
is that with regard to work place engineering , or just the work place environment 
it 's actually waste water . 
i see . 
i 'm actually in the air division , 
and we monitor anything that comes out of a stack , or out of a building , 
or we do have customers that their concerns are in the work place 
and we take care of that , 
the call last evening was supposed to be concerning recycling , in the community . 
and so i had thought a little bit about it before hand . 
but that 's interesting . 
i have a friend who is a planner . a city planner . 
and he models city districts , and so forth does computer modeling . 
he gets inputs from an environmental engineer . . 
actually , our division is corporate wide , 
of course we have several plants here , 
but we do air modeling also . 
i see . 
what we do , we have a weather station , that we get all of this information temperature , wind speed , wind direction , 
and we have a huge chemical data base . 
that 's interesting . 
and our chemical data base , 
so that we know every chemical on site and , its concentration , 
and if anything ever happened a building explosion or something we 'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station . 
we 've got to talk about music . 
and do you like classic rock , or modern rock , or which kind ? 
so that 's really what i like better , is that kind of music , 
is it disco , 
not that kind of music . 
that 's cool . 
and , how about the rolling stones ? 
i went to their concert last year when they were here . 
that 's when they toured . 
i like them . 
i just did n't know that much about music 
and i was n't sure what kind of music . 
it 's very hard 
i listen to heavy metal or classic rock . 
what kind of heavy metal are we talking about ? 
what , 
we 're talking about what they call hard rock . 
give me some examples . 
like bad company , 
what , 
bad company 's not bad , 
that 's not , 
they 're like a c d c . 
a c d c . 
why , 
have you heard of them ? 
and , stuff like that . 
that 's not really hard rock . 
i guess i did n't really consider that heavy metal . 
a c d c 's okay . 
but other bands consider it really hard rock . 
i do n't really care for that too much , i guess . 
and , what happens is like everybody gets totally into the music 
and then they start dancing around , 
and they just bump into each other , 
they hit each other with their shoulders , 
and , then , you knock people down , 
and what you do is , you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people . 
is that the kind of music that you like ? 
i do n't like that music . 
but , that 's what they do . 
that 's what some people call really heavy metal . 
and the difference between hard rock and heavy metal is the lyrics also . 
and you always thought about suicide . and killing people and stuff like that . 
they do n't talk about that , 
they just talk about life in general . 
of course . 
you 're talking queen , 
is that what you said ? 
but you got to like queen also . 
because queen was real popular when i was growing up . 
especially a night at the opera ? 
let 's see , 
the one that they have the whole opera singing in the background . 
that was great . 
i heard that the other day on the radio 
and i pumped it up . 
because i just love that song . 
that was a real good one . 
that whole record was pretty good . 
but then , they started going downhill like everybody else . 
that 's true . 
they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that . 
they 're still around , 
they 've got a new c d out , 
i like the old rolling stones . 
i do n't like the new stuff . 
of the stones ? 
i agree . 
the older stuff is the best of it . 
the new stuff 's kind of more like , today 's rock and roll , which i , do n't really care for today 's rock and roll too much . 
an old , genesis ? 
definitely . 
i agree . 
and then he came out with his record no jacket required . 
that was good , 
but it was on his way of going downhill , 
because he said , i can make a lot of money just singing alone , 
and then he came out with the invisible touch , with genesis 
i ca n't stand him . 
because , i look at him 
and i say you were singing at this time , and with these people , 
and you were great , 
and now you 're singing all this stuff that , does n't matter what you sing or what you record , 
it 's still going to be a number one hit . 
and so , that 's what gets me mad . 
but , did you go see that new doors movie ? 
not yet . 
i guess i 've been , kind of considering it . 
have you seen it yet ? 
i saw it when it opened . 
was it really good ? 
and , they both loved the movie ? 
they said the music 's great , 
it took me back to the sixties , and stuff like that . 
and then , one of them said , everything is great , 
but i 'm going to give it thumbs down . 
and they go , 
but why ? 
because the end is , really depressing . 
the movie is so well made , 
and the music that goes with it just picks you up , 
so , you did n't really grow up with that kind of music then . 
it 's just that the sixties music 's got a lot to say . 
disco , i do n't like disco , 
i 've never liked disco . 
but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants , 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
did you go to college ? 
i 'm going right now . 
that 's cool . 
but 
i did n't go then . 
i do n't know , 
disco was pretty much dead by then . 
disco was n't really my time . 
about music ? 
about everything . 
everything happened during the sixties , 
nobody cared to name it . 
that 's kind of funny . 
you 're right . 
i never thought of that . 
the disco years are gone . 
i know . 
what is it 
him just standing there . 
that 's a good example to look for in history . 
what happened in the middle ? 
do n't worry , 
do n't worry , 
you 're not missing anything , 
that 's true . 
it 's like they do n't want to talk about that , 
so they just , do n't name it . 
i guess it was pretty bad times . 
that 's very true . 
let 's see , 
we 've been talking for seven minutes , 
good . 
i have n't even been keeping track . 
i 'm going to leave you alone . 
what are you doing ? 
do you have a family ? 
i was kind of in the middle of supper , 
but it 's not a big deal , 
i 'm sorry . 
i just left it . 
it 's okay , 
somebody tried to call me last night 
but i did n't have my number yet , 
i just got it today . 
and so it 's okay . 
i told them i 'd be available during this time , 
so . 
then have fun doing this . 
it is not , that bad . 
have you all been able to do much as a family these days ? 
pardon me . 
have you all been able to do much as a full family these days , all of you . 
we 've gone all kinds of places , 
we go out to dinner , 
we take the kids to the park , 
and whenever my husband has time off or something , we take them to the zoo , 
or we do everything we can possibly as a family . 
do you work outside the home ? 
i do n't . 
i do n't either , 
it makes it a little bit easier that way . 
it does , 
an then my husband enjoys spending time with the kids , 
he 'll take them out just to be with them . 
so you have a break too . 
and we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home , 
and , we just do all kinds of fun things like that 
we have family that 's far away . 
it sounds like you might too . 
we do , 
so the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures . 
and phone calls that 's about it . 
and we go to the park 
or we go in the backyard and sit down 
that 's what we mostly do , pretty simple things . 
especially since my youngest one is only fourteen months . 
she 's really getting to the age where she 's playing , and likes to go places . 
and with me being at home and just having the one income you do n't have , this lot of extra money to do a lot of extra things . 
that 's right . 
they think that 's a lot of fun . 
so we try to spend as much time as we can . 
our whole weekends are devoted to our children except for we might go out one evening or something , 
but during the day it 's all devoted to our kids 
and they , go to church with us 
that 's true . 
have you ever been to the science place ? 
we have n't lived here too long 
and we went there a couple of weeks ago 
the kids thought that was wonderful . 
i guess there 's science place one and science place two . 
we 've only been in science place two . 
, i 'm not sure which one we went into , 
it was about a year or so ago , when we went . 
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a kid 's place area . 
they really seemed to go wild in there . 
they had a lot of fun in there 
and the kids can pet animals and stuff . 
where 's that . 
and that 's a lot of fun . 
they have tours going through there 
and the kids think that was a lot of fun , too . 
that does sound like fun . 
it 's a little bit of a ways , 
they do n't go for the food 
they go to play around 
that 's right . 
and it 's a indoor fun park 
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids . 
that sounds fun too . 
and parents get in free 
and , during the week , it 's five dollars admission per child , all day . 
that sounds fun 
i think maybe we 'll try to do that . 
the kids just had a wonderful time there , 
you just pay that admission , 
and then all the rides are free . 
of course , they have all the little video games and those little quarter rides to , and stuff like that 
but , they thought that was lot of fun . 
you can have birthday parties there 
so they had a lot of fun . 
that does sound like fun . 
i 've gotten some good ideas from you . 
i think , i do n't know if we 've done five minutes 
but i 'm sure that will be good . 
that will be good , 
it was good talking to you . 
it was good talking to you . 
i really appreciate your suggestions . 
no problem . 
take care . 
my favorite show is masterpiece theatre 
and it has been for a long time 
but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i have never met anybody who likes it . 
do you by any chance ? 
you do ! 
very much . 
would n't you know . 
as a matter of fact , i prefer public television . 
i watch mysteries too . 
is that what you 're referring to ? 
that is good . 
do you read ? 
that 's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they 're kind of based on books . 
unfortunately for us at least here in the united states , the only access we have to that of course is public television . 
what i do watch is usually news and whatever is on public television . 
me too . 
did you stay up late and catch this red dwarf ? 
that was a scream . 
i used to like him too , 
he was my hero . 
they 're showing live and let die at this moment , 
he can never cut it . 
that 's true . 
i was just thinking that today , 
he did , well , in some of the later movies 
he does . 
i liked his accent too . 
and , he can even be in movies that are not sexually oriented , 
and he still comes off great . 
he is . 
he had my vote double . 
i do n't care . 
and i particularly enjoy the series yes minister ? 
what 's that about ? 
that was about the interior minister , 
it was a comedy , 
i 've seen it several times . 
it 's a scream , 
but i have to go to bed , 
i have to get up and work the next morning . 
that 's why i say , did you stay up late to watch this red dwarf . 
i do n't think they should show it during prime time , 
but still , it was funny . 
i know . 
i read as i said quite a bit . 
i read about two or three novels a week , in addition to all the technical stuff . 
what do you do ? 
what kind of work do you do ? 
i 'm a payroll clerk . 
just an accounting clerk . 
i see . 
and i just wondered . 
but i needed the money . 
this is five bucks here . 
we 're not even supposed to be talking about this though , are we ? 
i guess not . 
how did i hear about it ? 
they are gathering a data base for voice processing . 
and , that 's my field of work also . 
and i heard about it , 
we could go back to television shows . 
speaking of public tv , have you caught any of this series on the bible ? 
i have . 
i 've heard that it 's coming out with the idea that the bible 's not true . 
you could interpret it that way . 
there 's one word for love of your brother , one word for love of your wife , one word for love of your father , and that sort of thing . 
so , those types of interpretations really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now , and what it 's at . 
you can look at it as though they are saying it 's not true , 
so it depends on how you look at it . 
if you want to say that it 's proven that it is n't true , then you can very much look at it that way . 
but as far as that goes , we at least agree on what we enjoy . 
that 's right . 
but i do n't know if there is a time limit on this , 
surely we 've made it . 
i think so too . 
it 's been very pleasant talking to you , 
it was very nice talking to you . 
and have a good evening . 
you too . 
how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes ? . 
my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class . 
how i met him was through the aerobics class that he used to teach . 
you 're a student ? 
enjoying anything dealing with sports . 
and how do you feel about it ? . 
i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise . 
i do n't very often do things for the sake of exercise . 
i do n't feel well unless i am exercising 
and i try to do things that involve exercise , 
this is my exercise time 
and i spend a lot of time 
and i probably get more exercise than your average person . 
but , it 's not a structured sort of thing , 
and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising 's sake , 
and perhaps , it 's because somehow that implies to me it 's not fun , or something like that . 
that 's the way my mother stands on it . 
she feels like if it 's something that you have to do if you look at it as if you have to do it , then it becomes a chore , 
and , she does n't enjoy it when it 's a chore . 
calculated down 
i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week . 
is that why you like aerobics classes , because someone else is doing the counting for you , so , it makes it less of a chore ? 
and i 've always enjoyed dance . 
i ca n't get out to dance all the time 
would that we could . 
and it 's more regulated , 
i mean you 're using different parts of the body . 
so , it is like dance , 
and it 's structured like that , 
like you said , someone else is counting , 
so , it makes it easier for me . 
and , someone else is telling me , let 's move this way , let 's move that way , instead of me having to think about it so much . 
you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise 
and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself . 
but , i 'm like you , 
and that was a lot of fun 
and you get to meet different people , and just get out out and about , 
we did it as a family , 
so , it was quite a lot of fun . 
and i love to swim , 
so i love it when it 's swimming weather , 
i did n't realize that . 
i 'm sorry . 
this is the first call i 've done , 
and , i did n't realize that they were going to reach out to people from , all over the country . 
you would n't know that . 
it 's interesting , because there are real regional differences . 
for all i know aerobics started out here . 
i do n't know where they actually started , 
but the craze really picked up big here 
and before that there was the running craze . 
but , the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere . 
so , there must be something to some of them . 
not just exercise , but , health related ideas . 
there 's a sense of it being a package , 
you 'll get organizations , like institutes for the whole health , or whatever . 
and , it does n't deal with just exercise , or just stress management , or just diet , or anything . 
it 's on fairly solid scientific ground . 
it 's just dispensed with these distinctions . 
it says all sorts of factors go into health and there 's no reason to talk about one rather than another , so that they combined them all together . 
there 's been some progressive medical schools out here , that have taken that approach . 
do you think that 's because they 've realized that for whole health , that , you have to have that combination , or that people are motivated that way so that they 've incorporated that into their program . 
i can say there 's a correlation , 
but i could n't say which caused the other . 
each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more , and a little bit more . 
the more money they put into it . 
i can see that . 
from institutes of learning like that , i know that they 've got to get their money somewhere , 
and somebody 's got to be willing to pay for it , and believe in it , 
exactly . 
and some of them fizzled out 
and some of them were disastrous 
and others of them had an impact on the society around here . 
and one of the ones that had an impact was people becoming interested in alternate practices , 
and you could have them around long enough 
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things , 
and exercise is strongly considered one of them . 
the irony is it 's people in the cities that are most oriented towards doing the exercise . 
and , i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks . 
or they 're older . 
pardon me . 
i sometimes think that it 's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city . 
like everything else . 
i live in a rural area , 
so i see that . 
the rat race to exercise . 
it 's frantic , to , achieve , something that a person in a rural area almost does n't worry about it to such a degree , but stays almost healthier , 
i think so . 
as a fit person . 
i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in china 
and they do n't do very much vigorous exercise at all . 
but , they do a lot of low keyed , low impact , low stress exercise , 
and they combine it with a meditation or whatever . some sort of relaxation 
they do n't have the hard body . 
they do n't have that perfect look , 
and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious . 
but they live to a hundred and ten some , 
do n't you think a lot of that is diet too ? 
and , a lot of that is diet . 
that 's true . 
so i 've read a lot of information , knowing that to be true , 
what 's that ? 
as am i . 
are you also , 
it is in the urban areas , 
in the urban areas ? 
that 's wonderful . 
most , sort of modern looking restaurants will , 
that 's great , 
it 's such a trouble here . 
you just have to eat at home basically . 
i was wondering that , 
and , it occurred to me , 
you get an influx of a lot of people from all over the country , 
so , you 're going to have more choices , 
but , in urban areas it 's steak places , 
it 's changing to a degree , 
but it 's very frustrating . and , even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or organic materials , and foods and things . 
you do n't really have that , 
you would think . 
i think the topic was crime in the city . 
i do not live in a city . 
i live in a real small little place . 
where is that ? 
north , south , east , or west ? 
not too far . 
i 've been through there . 
i 'm about eight miles south of it . 
but just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that , it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad . 
i 've seen those statistics and everything , 
i know , 
i know . 
i know . 
murder is nothing to them . 
i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , i guess . 
say you 're convicted 
and just let them go 
and if they get convicted again just kill them . 
i think that the best hope to eliminate crime , as we know it today is to eliminate the criminals from society . 
if someone is known to have been in prison , they ca n't get a job . 
you know . 
they ca n't be accepted into society . 
and who 's to put the limit on it ? 
and they 're still let out on the street after one or two years . 
so you serve your prison term , 
and then you go into the mental hospital , 
and if you 're pronounced cured , they 'll let you go . 
they may find a cure for it , 
but there is no known cure now . 
in other words , if you do something the first time , that 's not real bad , 
people make mistakes . 
to go ahead and let them go , 
use that 
or there 's other consequences rather than killing them , 
you could , always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against . 
at least they might get some benefit in that , 
and if the people they committed a crime against , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , are okay they can free them . 
but with the technology we have today , you can put a collar on a guy 's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property . 
and , you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act . 
but putting them in prison that does n't work . 
apparently not , 
because look how many years they 've been doing that 
. 
you look at places like turkey . 
turkey has the death penalty , for just about everything . 
if you get convicted of drug trafficking , they just kill you . 
you get convicted of heinous crimes , they just kill you . 
there 's no two ways about it . 
and you look at their society 
and the repeat offenders are very few . 
and you look at our society , almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison , has been in prison three or four times . 
three or four times , 
that is true , 
i know . 
one , you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven . 
i think that 's very important . 
i agree very much so on that , 
and then , if a parent has proved to be unfit , for any reason take the kids away from the parents . 
because we are what we teach . 
because that 's what our society becomes . 
we have just a bunch of people , 
i 've lived in that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work . 
and these guys , they come to work every morning 
and they 're stoned to the bone . 
they 're so high , they could fly up to the top of that building 
and they work all day , 
and they go home 
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs 
and when they run out of money , they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money , 
sure , 
they just think that 's the normal thing to do , do n't they ... 
and i worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester 
i had one kid threaten my life . 
in the first grade . 
and they flipping me the finger and all that 
and i just said to this kid , 
i said , you got two choices kid , 
you can step into mainstream society 
or you can die . 
because you will eventually be killed . 
i know . 
i know , 
i work in school , 
that 's something i do 
i 'm like you 
astonishing what the younger ages know , 
and they react to what they see at home . 
if they see violence at home , that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school . 
it really is , 
and that 's kind of sad . 
you can see it in the work place . 
used to be when you had a personality conflict you worked with it 
and you got through it . 
now people get fired , 
or what 's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired . 
or , one thing or the other . 
you put that many people on that small of a space , they 've learned to live together . 
it 's in their culture . 
teen . 
and the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people . 
if they were n't fit for the job they were hired for , they did n't just can them , 
they made a position for them some where . 
but she do n't like it . 
she just does n't like to do that . 
i love it . 
i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately . 
that 's my case also . 
i 've got a new born 
and there 's just no time . 
several years . 
my husband is even interested in it now . 
he likes to help me design projects that are , a little more customized . 
he looks at the pattern 
and he says how do you get that from there to the material . 
not that hard . 
it 's not . 
i really enjoy it . 
and once you get started on it , i love it . 
i do a lot of my own patterns also . 
it was tough , 
but . 
do you have any others , 
i do mostly that , 
not very artistic really for painting and stuff . 
but i do n't know . 
i do n't have them all yet certainly . 
i got to counting the other day 
and i think i have two hundred , 
it can add up quick . 
i just keep an inventory of what i currently have , 
just buy the colors that i need of what i 'm low on . 
i see . 
a lot of times you can do that . 
i just love all the different colors . 
they had quite a few new ones come out last year , that they added to . 
but , you do n't have much spare time either ? 
not lately . 
i just started a new job 
and that does take some time . 
how old ? 
he 's seven months old . 
and just into everything , 
so there 's not a spare moment . 
but i would n't trade it for the world . 
we missed it last year , 
so hopefully this year he 'll have one . 
last year he was a little bit young for having one . 
he would n't have enjoyed it anyway . 
you would have 
all he liked was the lights this year , 
that 's kind of strange that we got the same call . 
i 'm sorry . 
go ahead . 
that 's okay . 
but 
i 've been doing it for probably ten years or so . 
i just started about five years ago , i think . 
but it is peaceful , 
it is relaxing to do , once you find the time to do it . 
and i got one done 
and i think the child is going to be in high school before i get finished . 
bear thing . 
i bought the cloth and the pattern for it . 
i did n't buy a kit . 
it 's that cloth . 
it 's cloth i think . 
and it has the borders and everything already . 
those are pretty . 
number one turned out just great , 
and the lady said she could n't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery 
and i did n't even know it . 
i gave it to her 
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used . 
i said did n't . 
it worked out that way . 
that 's great . 
i like those . 
those are pretty . 
she said , i know she does n't get to touch it . 
she hung it on the wall . 
they 're just too nice . 
i 've enjoyed this . 
you too . 
the topic is to discuss the sources where i receive news . 
and for me that 's mostly newspaper and radio , 
i almost never watch television , as a matter of course 
so , i do n't get news from television , 
is that not true ? 
it was unusual not to have the different sources of news coverage . 
i do n't know . 
i guess , i just wanted more news . 
what 's the other one , 
c b s . 
c b s . 
were they ? 
that 's the only thing they broadcast 
and like you i listened to radio on my job at work . 
you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got . 
and i was watching on tv 
so we got all fearful for our people , 
come to find out they came back and said they were n't even aware of it , 
and so it really made me question as to how do we know if the news we 're getting is any good . 
and i can remember being in these earthquakes 
and they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view , and from anyone else 's point of view , 
but they get all blown up in the news . , 
specially tv , 
local news concentrates , on murders and things like that . 
and we have a lot of bad stuff , 
it just really gets me depressed , even to watch it . 
so then , you wake up one morning 
and you are in war with somebody 
you do n't even know about it . 
but i do n't read newspapers . 
do n't you ? 
how come ? 
i find it hard to follow from one page to another . 
it 's just something i have never developed an interest in . 
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it 's stolen before i can get out and get it . 
that sounds pretty bad to me . 
who would steal a newspaper ? 
you would be surprised . 
they just come by and pick them up even if it 's just for the tv selections of the day . 
i see . 
i do n't know . 
it just would n't be there whenever i tried it . 
you 're right , 
who would steal a newspaper ? 
but , they do . 
that 's where i am speaking to you from . 
but , i grew up in l a . 
i work out here . 
i do n't . 
and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them . 
i 'm in the computer business . 
current events is not a good subject for me . 
i do n't keep up with it that often . 
let 's see , 
i 've never done this before , 
this is your first call ? 
so i do n't know , 
it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes , 
but i think we 've been talking for three minutes 
and nobody has interrupted . 
i got into a conversation last night with a lady 
i see . 
nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you too . 
how you doing ? 
not bad , 
not bad . 
what 's your name ? 
wait . 
let me turn off my stereo here . 
because i 've been waiting for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody . 
are you ? 
let 's see , 
on the other coast . 
it 's midnight almost ? 
what ? 
i guess we 're supposed to talk , 
what about 
credit card ? 
wait . 
one of my instructors said that they were doing something like this 
what are you working on ? 
a masters in information systems . 
i 'm doing my masters in computer science and computer engineering . 
where at ? 
how do you like it out there ? 
i do n't . because i come from a bigger city than this one 
that area . 
and it 's really small . 
all you have is towns built around universities . 
so it 's basically a bunch of small towns anyway . 
but they do n't have a whole lot there . 
where you at ? 
and that 's about it . 
and it 's only a hour away to a large city . 
where do you go ? 
that 's what they look for . 
whether or not they get it is hard to say . 
i know . 
that 's why i did n't apply . 
it 's pretty tough . 
it 's pretty tough . 
let 's face it . 
the school only takes you so far . 
it 's what you do . 
so i do n't lose any sleep over stuff like that . 
are you going to go for your doctorate ? 
probably not . 
i 'm in the navy . 
if i do do it , it will be after i get out of the navy . 
when do you get out ? 
probably be another twelve years . 
i like what i 'm doing right now . 
but what if they pay for it ? 
excuse me ? 
they wo n't pay for it . 
because i know a couple of people here that work for the army . 
they civilians or military ? 
i think they 're military . 
and so he 's doing his masters here . 
they gave him a scholarship for a year . 
and he 's doing it in a year and a summer . 
and so he 's getting that 
and they said they got a lot of benefits and that . 
that 's why you want to join . 
you can earn a lot more money 
i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money , once you 've get your masters . 
they go , they got a lot of benefits that would go with it 
so . 
a lot of times it 's not the money that keeps people in . 
they like what they 're doing . 
they feel good about what they 're doing . 
that type of thing . 
and that 's not what they 're paying . 
easily , 
i 'm sure . 
it depends on what rank you are , of course . 
i know . 
those are few and far between though . 
and everyone 's a manager . 
but nobody can get one more point to become whatever you need to earn so much money . 
since i imagine it 's fairly competitive . 
all the major companies get into a boating race , 
and then they come in last 
and they have this whole team analyze why they came in last 
because the person asked for it . 
he goes , the problem was that there were five people saying row , row , row and one person rowing , 
so he goes have you come up with a solution ? 
it 's like everyone 's a , manager 
but it 's like one person does the work 
i do n't know , 
that can really slow you down . 
that 's the way it works . 
that 's why they 're having problems . 
everyone 's a manager 
i did n't realize that . 
it 's like the people that actually do the work there are very few . 
and then the other people just plan it . 
push paper around . 
all these people are just sitting around , just going what shall we do ? 
has anybody thought of anything ? 
and then this guy from federal express comes along . 
they go what 's that ? 
this track which it 's going around the world 
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere , any time . 
so they have this think tank . 
and they got to come up with ideas . 
they 've got basically a lock on a lot of the market . 
and it fails 
and you 're dead . 
why did n't you try something more mainline . 
so you quit . 
that 's their policy . 
they never fire anybody unless you 're caught doing something illegally . 
illegal or something like that , 
if you 're stealing something or doing anything like that . 
but they wo n't let you off . 
suppose you 're a manager . 
so they 'll put you into keeping up the paper . 
it 's how much paper is going in ? 
and then you say that 's not my job , 
so you quit . 
so , in other words , that 's the way they force people out . 
that 's why they can say there 's no layoff policy . 
but they do n't really say that , 
you 're always going to have great career conditions . 
that 's kind of sad . 
but it 's like they have just different policy . 
i do n't know . 
my dad works for them 
but it 's like in their commercials , they never put down any other company . 
they 're the standard right now . 
because what happens is they have a good backup policy . 
and anybody can fix it . 
and so that 's what you 're going to go for . 
that 's a big thing . 
and it 's for example , like leading edge . 
have you ever heard of leading edge ? 
what ? 
leading edge . 
they made small personal computers . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know . 
for example , you test a chip . 
it ca n't last seven years 
but it can last five . 
leading edge will say we 'll buy it from you . 
they 're still around i think . 
i 've seen them around anyway . 
so , that 's what they do . 
and by the time you have computer for five years , you 're going to throw it away anyway . 
most people do . 
or they have to anyway . 
and he got that . 
i was testing it 
and it was wonderful . 
and then when you tried to erase and correct all the errors in your voice , it takes up all your memory . 
and i want more . 
it 's why do you want more . 
because it 's one second of recording . 
you put into wave 
and you want to correct the errors into wave , 
it takes so much , 
of course it does . 
and you put it in there , 
and you want to correct those . 
and then you 're trying to make the wave smooth 
of course it 's going to take a lot . 
imagine what it is for us to make mark off models . 
it 's amazing . 
when you get right down to it the more they can do for you , the more memory they 're going to require . 
like they say nobody can get enough . 
you find out more , 
what ? 
this is like video game stuff . 
but the only thing was , that it was just lines , 
what do you think in terms of benefits ? 
of course i 'm sure we 're familiar with the exact same benefit package 
and i think that we 've probably got one of the best around , 
besides , they tend to offer adequate vacation , i guess . 
and the paid time off is wonderful , 
and i think that is just a fabulous one , 
so . i do n't know if you participate in that or not , 
is n't it great ? 
it 's just a miracle how fast that adds up . 
i have to agree with that . 
i was thinking about importance of benefits and that kind of thing , other than salary while i was waiting for the system to find a respondent . 
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed 
and i suspect that that 's probably true for everyone . 
when i was much younger it was less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits . 
but as i grow older and my family grows , the medical benefits are more important 
and the retirement is more important . 
i had never really thought of it that way 
but i guess that 's true , 
i guess that 's true . 
i 'm still young enough that , the vacation 's real important to me 
and the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing . 
now that i 'm a hundred percent vested you kind of look through the book and see what does that mean and what is the pension all about 
i 'm only in my late twenties now , 
so you tend not to think about retirement . 
i guess now is the time to think about it , 
i think they have one that we need to recognize that we 're going to have to supplement ourselves . 
it 's certainly a supplemental way , 
all by itself it wo n't be adequate for my situation . 
it 's not going to build up , quite enough , 
so , i have to find a way to supplement that . 
they seem to make it so easy to save . 
but i 've got money coming out to buy savings bonds , just coming straight out of my check . 
and it 's probably not a great investment , 
but if i was n't doing that the money would n't be being saved anyway . 
i kind of have to trade off . 
if you never see it you do n't spend it , 
i understand though , 
believe me , 
i do that myself . 
do you ? 
and i disagree with you . 
i do n't think it 's the worst investment , in the world . 
do you really not ? 
i debate about whether it 's really good or not . 
and maybe you do n't start looking for that word guaranteed , until later . 
it 's shown a history that sure beats anything else . over many , many years . 
that 's true . 
that 's very true . 
they work up this whole big profile for you , all the things that you need to work on and you need to do . 
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was the need to save for our son 's education . 
we have a two year old , 
we have to do that now . 
and he 's two now , 
what it costs now is ridiculous , 
in that way , at least we know that that 's taken care of . 
we can worry about other things 
i understand , that approach . 
that 's exactly what 's happening in my family . 
is it really ? 
except that mine are a little bit older 
and i 've shown them the numbers and said this is what 's going to be available , 
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you 're there . 
you better make sure that you 've got a scholarship . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
that 's what she said to us . 
she said , do you all want him to go to a state college or a private college ? 
and our answer was , that we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college . 
and if he wants to go to a private college , he can get a scholarship to attend . 
and that was kind of our view on it . 
it just costs too much , 
you just ca n't do it . 
so , i do n't know , 
it just amazing , 
i just do n't know how anybody 's going to do it . 
i know . 
and it gets really scary when you start talking to them . 
and i said , that 's wonderful . 
i applaud that . 
and , then her little brother 's only two years behind 
and he says , i do n't know , 
and i said , that 's great . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
and then i think there 's some negatives , 
but there 's going to be some negatives anywhere no matter where you go . 
this is the first really large company i 've worked for . 
i 've always been involved in little small privately owned firms 
and so i 've never had the big benefit package . 
so , i really do n't know how to compare it to other big companies . 
when i came on it was great because i had never had anything even close to what they offered . 
so , i 've been real pleased . 
that 's fantastic , 
and on whole i would say that they 're equal to most of our competitors . 
think so ? 
and you can pick what you want 
and . 
now it 's up to you 
it 's menu selection , so , to speak . 
that sounds really good . 
i read a thing , 
if you 've been there under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that 's really not enough and you want an extra week , then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying , i 'm going to want an extra five days this year 
and they 'll take a set amount out of each paycheck , 
and they 're deducting it all along , 
so you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time , 
you 're really not being paid for them , 
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket , 
but it 's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once . 
so , that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in 
i could certainly , personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime . 
and i do n't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days , if they did , that . 
and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one 
or maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one . 
as a repayment for , every three to five days that i work overtime there , they should give me one day . 
and 
and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person 
and i see a lot of differences , from one group to the next about who gets it and who does n't get it . 
and that 's that way with a lot of things there . 
it seems like , it depends on what group you happen to be in , what you 're going to get and what you 're not going to get 
that 's for sure . 
which is the same , 
but then it 's probably that way anywhere , 
i 'm sure personalities always come into play . 
the question was what is your opinion of youth spending a year or two in public service . 
i think it would be a great idea . 
i do n't know , 
but i think it would be a great idea . 
seems like there 's so many kids that do n't have any since of what they want to be or do 
or they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time 
and all countries sure need help 
for instance , everybody had what they called there social year , that they had to put in 
and basically it was a repayment for , high school education , 
and most of them joined the red cross 
and it was done internally . 
there was very little external . 
i think possibly what they 're thinking about here , more external peace corps , type things where we 're sending people off shore . 
i think that would be real interesting for people to do , 
but , i guess , my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them to other countries , 
but , i do n't know . 
i did n't know . 
i do n't know how the peace corps works , 
i , guess i was of age when the peace corps came in , and all that . 
i was too . 
i thought seriously about joining at that time , 
i thought it was a fantastic idea . 
i sent off for stuff on it , 
but i do n't remember that much . about it . 
i know that they trained you in the language 
you actually got paid too , while in the peace corps , 
it was n't much , 
i think so , 
where they could n't do that . 
you might end up with a revolution . 
i do n't know which end though . 
that 's been interesting , though , the kids that have been over coming back right now . 
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while , what percentage of them would actually say , that 's not a bad way to do it , 
because from what i understand , from some of the guys i know crime is punishable , just almost instantly and public , 
public hanging . 
public hanging and this sort of thing , 
so you do n't have just a whole lot of , what we consider street crimes . 
i 've heard that in china and stuff , there is virtually no such thing as rape , because if you rape somebody you 'd be murdered on the street 
the public service thing again 
or it can be , 
people will kind of set up their own little club , 
that 's true . 
might not go if it was voluntary , 
but i do n't know how they 'd enforce it , 
shoot them . 
put them in jail . 
i do n't know . 
because he was in it . 
he thought that was great . 
the rest of it was all hog wash , 
but that was great . 
it seems like it would develop pride in people , if , it 's in their own country . 
it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them , if it was handled that way . 
it would take quite a few people . 
so maybe that part of it would be helpful too . 
i do n't know . 
that brings up the interesting subject too , 
who would determine what these people do . 
c c c was run by the army 
really there could be some scandals involved , if it was n't people that were really fair and in a legal way or something , 
they could send all the people over to one particular part of town or one particular project , that somebody had paid somebody to get supported , 
we 've gotten to the point where if the racial make up of the group was such and such they 'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and that kind of thing . 
that could be complicated too , could n't it . 
suppose they had a group who were construction oriented 
and they went 
and they built a swimming pool , or anything , 
and one , you can only build it in one place , 
and know matter where you build it , somebody else is going to scream , you did n't build one over here . 
that 's true . 
unfair or something , 
it 's one of those things on the surface it seems like a great idea . 
it 's like a joke i heard once about elephant foot soup , 
it 's easy to do once you find a elephant foot . 
it 's the logistics of the thing that gets you going . 
it seems like there 's a lot , 
you do n't hear much on the news about young people really wanting to do anything good or anything like that , 
but i 'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing . 
they wanted to start a club for the teenagers , instead of all these gangs kids could join to belong . 
but they did n't have anything positive the kids could be doing , helping , 
so they were trying to start that out , 
so if there 's kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy . we ought to use them if they 're willing to do it . 
here you are to the logistics of the thing again . 
who 's going to run it , 
what , 
how , 
and they have situations like that down there . where they have , the social , in some sort of way , 
and when they came back , they 'd have to serve this year , 
and it turned out to be kind of a joke , 
the ones i knew always chose the red cross , because they did n't do anything 
i see . 
and they had all kinds of things they could go into , agricultural , and really good stuff , 
but unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that , red cross , it was so many of them in it , that your chance of having to do something it was very slim . 
and there is men and also women , 
women are n't nearly as frequent , 
and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left , that can volunteer to go on a mission 
and they 're all over the world . 
and , it 's incredible logistics , 
they have a training center where they teach them , 
and they have , to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things , 
then that 's kind of a private organization , 
he had a direct connection somewhere , 
he felt that he really had an in 
so things he would do with an airplane , 
but any rate that 's off the subject , 
they do n't get paid for it , 
but there is funding that comes , 
they 're supposedly saving up on their own 
and the church helps them out some , 
but , you know , that it is incredible . 
with credit cards me , i try to get maybe just one or two , 
i do n't like having credit cards for every store . 
i just do n't like them . 
what are you afraid of with them ? 
what am i afraid of ? 
i do n't know if i 'm really afraid of spending too much . 
i just do n't think that i need them . 
they are tempting at times , 
but sometimes i just do n't like everybody knowing everything about me , 
that can be very , very true . 
and everybody just gives you a credit card just so you 'll spend money 
that 's the idea . 
they figure that , if they give you card , at no charge for a whole year that you will use it 
that 's right . 
they make money off of it , whether you use it or not . 
the other thing , of course , is the fact that they hope , you will not pay your bill at the end of the month , so that you would be paying interest . 
that 's right . 
i use mine a great deal for groceries , for everything that i can and , then just write one check at the end of the month , for the entire thing , 
that 's what i do . 
that 's what i do . 
just a second . 
that 's all right . 
sounds like you have a little one there . 
i have two little ones . 
you have . 
how old are they ? 
four and two and half . 
. those are two very active ages . 
i 'm like you 
i just use it whenever i feel like i do n't want to write a check , 
but i do n't charge anything that i ca n't payoff at the end of the month . 
i never do . 
my husband does at work just to get cash out , 
but i take the checkbook 
so if i need cash , i just tell him 
and he gets it out 
and i do n't even think i know my number . 
i find it a great use from the standpoint that you do n't have to continue to write checks , in order to get cash . 
that 's right . 
he could n't do without it , since he can just do it right there at work , for nothing . 
that helps . 
and when they do that , they begin paying interest right from that very day on . 
you 're right . 
and that 's kind of silly . 
that 's correct . 
you 're defeating the purpose . 
the idea is to use their money . 
and during that whole month and , then pay it at the end of the month . 
i get at least one or two a week . people , sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone 
and i just say i do n't want it . 
i think that 's the only thing you can do , is just say no and mean no and , not be tempted . 
it 's like , i 'd like to know where they determine that i 'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say , you get this much credit line . 
that 's their favorite word . 
i think so , 
you 're right . 
it 's interesting that people have generally the same view . of credit cards , no matter where you go . 
and , then , some people they get so wrapped up in them that one day they find , i did n't realize i 'd spent this much money . 
that much stuff . 
and , then they ca n't meet the minimum monthly payments on it . 
and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own , 
it does because you 're just costing yourself more money because if you ca n't make the monthly , minimum payment , you 're paying interest , again 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
it 's been enjoyable talking with you . 
it 's enjoyable seeing that somebody feels the same way , 
take good care . 
take care of your little ones . 
you too . 
good luck . 
i 'll just hand it off to you 
and i enjoy it , 
it 's relaxing . 
and you kind of get absorbed in it 
so the time goes by before you realize anything is going on . 
and i play the organ sometimes just for my own satisfaction . not for anybody else 's ears 
because i 'm not that good at it , 
how about yourself ? 
so i never have time to deal with them . 
i like photography a lot , 
that 's neat . 
i used to do that a lot 
we have a new child that will be a year old here next week , 
that 's great , 
first one , you know how that is . 
i play about every night . 
and i really love that , 
that sounds nice . 
i 've done it before when i was in high school and college , and thoroughly enjoyed it , 
and it 's really a blast . 
my wife hates it , 
but that 's the way life is , i guess . 
that 's the hard part ? 
if you can do things together , that really helps a lot . 
she 's into aerobics , 
and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half 
that 's good , too . 
and that went over real well , 
but that 's about it there . 
it 's good 
and it 's healthy , too . 
we do that too , 
we try to get twenty minutes at least three for four times a week . 
that 's great . 
that 's great . 
and we like movies , 
spare time , 
so we 've been out twice in this year so far . by ourselves without the child 
so it 's kind of become an issue you could say . 
i like , messing around in your house building things , and putting cabinets up , and , those kind of things , 
that 's great , too . 
we did some remodeling when we bought a house , 
we put a kitchen in and that kind of stuff , 
that 's fun . 
it 's really kind of fun . 
it is . 
it really is . 
especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty , 
exactly . 
i like things that two people can do , 
but i like the quiet of doing things away , 
kind of gives you some space for yourself , 
and that 's what i find in making the dolls and things , that it gives me something that i can create , 
i like doing things with my hands . 
sounds like it . 
do you like to cook ? 
i love to cook . 
i love to cook , too , 
amount of people eat , and then say , this is really good , 
it is . 
work in the garden , work around the yard , of course , 
we sure do , 
smoke them , 
smoking and all that stuff ? 
all that stuff that 's bad for you . 
and that was great . 
really great , 
that 's only way to do it . 
they have some nice stuff down there . 
i miss it . 
there 's pluses to everything , 
but seems like there 's just so many things to do down here , 
i like the sports , 
in fact , when my children were growing up , we always had horses 
and that was kind of for them , 
but they were n't as interested in it as we were , 
we always had horses around , 
and i really enjoyed that , 
that 's great , 
i did n't see that many of them . 
horses ? 
you really do n't . 
you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete , 
i know , 
i know , 
it 's true . 
there 's buildings and concrete and a lot of people 
and that 's about it down here , 
but that 's great . 
you too , 
you too . 
look , 
i know it 's probably late for you , 
i enjoyed speaking with you 
me too . 
have a good weekend . 
i do n't know , 
which end do we push 
but 
let 's see , 
i think there 's a lot of people that do n't vote because they do n't really think their , opinion is going to be heard 
and there 's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the united states 
their , vote 's not going to make that much difference 
and whether you vote for one person or the other person , the issues is what you believe in , 
since there 's so many issues , this one person can believe a lot of different ways on , all of them 
so , it would be really difficult to have that one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed . 
that 's true , 
i think that it ends up the people that vote every time elections come around are more the party type followers , the guys that follow the party lines , 
and , they just go in 
and the people that are independent are the ones that do n't really show up every year because they ca n't seem to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate . 
that 's good . 
but that did n't work . 
and then people always get upset about it , too , because every year the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote , 
they each think that if more people vote , they 'll get more votes ? 
i 'm always amazed that each candidate thinks it 's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him . 
that 's true . 
but down in d c where things are a little bit different it 's women 's rights and that sort of movement , 
and so it 's quite the opposite , 
the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones . 
that 's true . 
and it does n't matter who they put in office , they 're going to fall subject to the pressure that the lobbyists can put , 
and it 's real true that they 'll say one thing , to get elected , 
and then once they do get elected , they do n't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised beforehand . 
maybe it just was n't possible at all in the first place like the no new taxes thing . 
with the economy going the way it is and everything , that was nearly ridiculous thing to , even try to do . 
i do n't think he 's going to have to worry about that next year . 
i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected . 
after the war . 
so they wo n't even bother turning out . 
that 's true , 
we 'll see you in four years . 
that 's what they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that are n't turning out at the booths , 
so they do n't , turn out to vote 
but , i know , my grandmother has n't voted in years . 
neither has mine as a matter of fact . 
and , that 's true , 
i think they look at it as , everybody , the majority of the people think this way , when that 's not necessarily true , because that 's what the media says . 
the majority believes this way 
so they do n't even bother turning out to vote to express their opinions . 
so that 's true . 
wonder if they 're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there 's little children bouncing in your knee , the whole time you 're talking . 
do you hear the dogs in the background here ? 
i ca n't hear them . 
the children next door just opened the fence 
and they went off . 
i guess we 've talked long enough 
and that was sort of interesting . 
what part of the country are you from ? 
are you really ? 
how did they get you ? 
they went through engineering companies , 
and we 're communications . 
i work in a communications company . 
and i thought , that might be interesting . 
sort of different . 
that was very strange . 
i guess they were doing eastern standard time . 
i do n't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes . 
central standard time is what they 're doing it by . 
i still have n't figured out the zero through six days which day is which yet 
but , i did n't study it that hard 
so maybe i 'll figure it out . 
but it was nice to talk to you and sort of meet you , 
and , that was an interesting topic . 
you 'll say talked to that guy . 
. 
we live right by the airport . 
so do we . 
i 'll talk to you later . 
that 's the only thing i found out tonight . 
you found that out tonight ? 
i have n't even heard that , 
that 's great . 
i think he deserves every penny of it . 
but , there are some others out there that i do n't believe deserve the money they 're getting . 
is n't it funny how baseball 's getting less than football players would . 
and they play a lot longer season , too . 
and a lot more games ? 
that 's exactly right . 
but i think , 
let 's see , 
i do n't even know who won the pennant last year . 
beats me . 
not lately though . 
we have been talking about this , 
i tried to call earlier , 
and we had made a list of all these baseball teams and the cities that they were from 
then i started cleaning 
and i do n't even know where i even put that paper . 
threw it away . 
let 's see . 
i think the a 's were in it last year . 
have you ever played baseball ? 
that 's what i did when i was growing up . 
that was fun . 
that 's fun . 
that 's a whole different sport . 
let 's see , 
and let 's see , 
i do n't even remember his name either . 
every once in a while i like to go on the nights when there 's not very many people out there . 
it 's a lot more fun when you 're not fighting a crowd . 
i think it 's fun , 
sometimes if you go out there during the day , you just fry under the sun . 
it 's nice at night . 
that 's when i 've been . 
it is . 
and do you know anything about that new stadium , 
have you seen all those pictures that they 're going to put out there ? 
it 's suppose to be a huge stadium 
and it 's going to have little shopping centers in it and a lake or something running through it . 
and they 're going to try to make it a real community center out there . 
and they 're never going to let liquor in there . 
they 're trying . 
i know , 
but they try every year 
and every year they get thrown out . 
it 's so stupid because they let you take it in there , 
but they do n't allow them to sell it there . 
but that new stadium 's going to be real nice , 
and i heard that you can bid on that stadium 
last night on the news i heard that they said you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you , 
and it 's going to go to the highest bidder . 
. that 's the way to do it . 
you hear that ? . 
that 's my kids turning on their music . 
. i stay away from them . 
i wish i could . 
i bet you do . 
where are you ? 
you are ? 
what 's he teach ? 
what do you do ? 
i teach , 
you do ? 
for right now . 
i 'm trying to get out . 
is that a tough system to be in ? 
real hard ? 
it 's good because they try new things , 
but it 's like , they 'll try something 
and then they throw it out , and get something else , 
and you get tired of that . 
that 's typical bureaucracy though . 
i think it 's going to be any where you go 
it 's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones , 
i do n't know , 
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad . 
but they ca n't be though , 
they do n't have as much money . 
most of the time . 
but the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes . 
there 's so many of them . 
you do n't even know who to payoff ? . 
somebody walks in a classroom 
and you do n't know what they 're there for when they 're coming , how long they 're going to be , 
how funny . 
it 's just there they are 
and they 're writing the whole time . 
no communication whatsoever . 
i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything , 
i know . 
and they 'll tell you they 've written something down , 
and you hope they 're telling you the truth . 
and you never see it . 
that 's got to be frustrating . 
it is . 
that 's about ten too many . 
now my job 's good , much better than a lot , because i 'm chapter one , 
and all i do is teach reading all day long , 
and it 's just ten children at a time . 
that 's not bad . 
it 's good , 
and you 've got a lot of federal money , too . 
but has n't it changed a lot over the years ? 
teaching ? . 
or working in the system . 
and i said , i want to see a curriculum guide so i 'll know what i 'm suppose to teach 
and they go , we do n't have one . 
we do n't even know where one is . 
and so i go , okay 
you just , did , what you wanted to do , 
how funny . 
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and what day , what period . 
you do n't know , which is worse . 
i know which is worse . 
i guess so . 
being told what to do is worse . 
how long are we suppose to talk for ? 
you can talk for ten minutes 
but you do n't have to . 
you can ? 
and 
if you talk to ten then they come on and say , you 've extended your limit , 
i have n't ever talked that long . 
and we started talking about gangs . 
and , everybody else that i 've talked to has been right around here . 
but , she was real interesting . 
and then tonight this woman called , 
have you taken any incoming calls ? 
so hers was the first one i gotten 
and she was telling me all her problems , 
and it went over ten minutes . 
did you all not talk about the topic at all ? 
we did , 
but the topic was boring i thought . 
what would you serve if you were having a dinner party ? 
the one i talked about the other night was good , 
it was about movies what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that . 
i could go on and on about that . 
me , too , 
because we go all the time , 
the guy i was talking to never goes , 
he was , it sounds like you 're really up on this . 
i said , i see at least two a week . 
so , that was real good to talk about that . 
you 've got to go see that . 
we talked about that one too . 
and he said he did n't think it should have gotten all those awards , 
he thought it was too long 
i enjoyed it . 
i did , too . 
it was just more for my money . 
i did n't think it was too long at all . 
he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch . 
the other one you need to go see is sleeping with the enemy . 
and , how old are your kids ? 
one is eight 
it 's not too cool for kids . 
they usually pick their own . 
i bet they do . 
they 've got it all figured out . 
they want to see all the horror movies . 
but most of the time really we watch them on the video . 
do n't you ? 
just massive rental . 
that 's a lot cheaper then taking them out to the show . 
i know . 
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you do n't have to watch them all in one time . 
that 's what we do , especially when it 's bad weather just , plug it in . 
of course , you have to get there early if you want to get anything , decent . 
i know . 
and they 're cheap 
and nobody has got them yet . 
that 's true . 
unbelievable . 
that 's true . 
we saw heroes have always been cowboys , tonight . 
it was okay , 
it was kind of slow , 
i do n't know , 
one of those movies it 's not going to be around long , 
it will be a dollar movie in no time . 
do you read ? 
not very much , 
i do n't have the patience to read . 
i do that to make myself go to sleep at night . 
my mom and dad read all the time . 
you saw field of dreams a long time ago ? 
sure did . 
i was reading the book , 
it was so wonderful . 
and then i decided , i like this author , 
so i got a book of his short stories , 
and that 's been real good . 
who is the author ? 
do n't ask me . 
was it like the movie ? 
quite a bit . 
but in the movie the guy was black , 
he was n't in the book , 
that 's one difference . 
there really was n't a lot of difference . 
i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie . 
that 's interesting . 
that was a good movie , too . 
do you think we covered baseball ? 
i think so . 
have a good night . 
i 'll let you start first ? 
i 'm presently living in a house , 
we had the house built 
and so this is our fifth year in it i guess , 
and it was a real excitement to go out and select the house and have one made and built like you wanted it , 
and they 're good for about five years or four years 
and after that they start falling apart . 
but they 're a cheap house . 
if you ca n't afford something good , 
they 're good for that , 
and you can call it a home because it 's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head , 
how about in your case ? 
in my case my husband is not a carpenter , 
but , in fact , he 's in electronics , 
but he knew the only way we 'd ever have a new home is if he would build it . 
so it took him about two and a half years , 
but he built us a house , 
and it 's a brick house , 
so that way we could kind of control it , 
and we live in kind of a small town , 
and it 's nothing fancy , 
it 's a house , 
it 's nice , 
and it 's real pretty 
and we 're all comfortable in it . 
that 's great , 
that 's great , 
as a matter of fact another guy is building one now , 
he 's been doing it for three years 
and the city 's a little upset with him , 
but i understand you save a lot of money off by doing that , 
you can because that way you 're not having to pay the middle men and everybody else . 
nothing wrong with that , 
you know . 
my brother 's a trim carpenter , 
and he came in and did the inside for us , 
and that helped . 
that was a big savings . 
and we had to hire the plumbing and the brick and everything else , 
he did everything else . 
we 've been in it six years . 
that 's great . 
have you been in it long ? 
our kids are kind of still small now , 
and we had thought before we do n't need such a large house that we 'll sell it , 
i see , 
first one is always a bear . 
we 're having an architect friend of mine design a house for us 
and that can basically be put in any state , , 
so that 's kind of , we just got with him and told him what all we wanted , 
and he 's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it 
and he 's certified , and registered 
at least we know it 's not going to fall in or something if it 's built . 
but i have heard that your approach is right , 
and that 's kind of the plan i have 
everyone i talk to i file in my little book and do other things with it . 
that 's great , 
that 's great . 
but we could not have one as large as we have if we had n't did it ourselves . 
i can imagine . 
but it 's ours . 
if you 're happy with it , that 's all that counts . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
that 's all , 
you only have to satisfy yourself and no one else . 
apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high . 
that 's , an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell , i guess . 
is n't it ? 
it really is 
because i 'm always shocked at what they have it appraised at , 
i think , my goodness . 
that 's great . 
i guess that about does it . 
and it was nice talking to you . 
nice talking with you , too . 
since i 'm in school i do n't basically have a monthly budget because i 'm living off my dad , 
but the thing is that i have to keep it under control because , for example it 's like the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything , everything is pretty rough , 
but he controls that part 
it 's like , once the semester starts i 'm the one who has to control how much spending there is . 
and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food 
what about tuition and rent ? 
who takes care of that ? 
so what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts . 
and then the tuition is also the same thing . 
and that 's about it . 
but the thing also is that if you want to go out if you want to go to a restaurant or something , then i have to moderate that because it 's like i ca n't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars three times a week . 
you ca n't do that very often . 
for us it 's i can spend that money 
but it 's not what i want to spend it on . 
are you working anywhere while you are going to school ? 
because they do n't allow me to work since i 'm a foreign student . 
and so the government does n't allow me to work . 
so all the money comes from home . 
so how do you keep track of where you are in your monthly spending ? 
the thing is that i basically know how much i have ? 
i get all my money out of the teller . 
and besides one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call international . 
where do you call to ? 
one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills . 
talk too long . 
they want me to call down there every so often . 
i told my dad , dad listen 
if you want to save money i wo n't call so often , 
he goes , we want to keep in touch 
so i does n't matter about the money because we need to hear from you . 
so you call him collect ? 
because it is more expensive that way . 
what makes you , think so ? 
basically the united states is the cheapest country to call out of . 
and because it 's considered a luxury in other countries . 
you just call him direct 
and you get the bill and send it to him ? 
i got money to pay that , too . 
it 's not too much money , 
and it 's not too little money , 
so i wo n't have to rush a letter to him or something , 
because he really wants me to concentrate on my studies . 
what are you studying ? 
i 'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering . 
and what do you think you 'll do with that ? 
with those degrees ? 
i can work here up to a year . 
and hopefully get a job after that . 
you want to get into some kind of manufacturing , 
or what 's the specialty that you 're looking for ? 
computer communications and data transmissions . 
so you want to find a data transmissions , 
you 're looking for long distance type stuff . 
anywhere from local area networks , metropolitan area networks all that , 
and so you have a family ? 
i have a wife and two children 
and does your wife work ? 
she does n't work , 
it 's kind of hard to say now days , 
and she gets paid for that 
so she brings some money in . 
and do that on a full time basis here in town . 
and you have a monthly budget ? 
sort of . 
i guess , that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we 've got at the end of the month , 
and we know what bills have to be paid , 
and we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with the monthly budget , 
we 're like everybody else , 
that 's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff . 
then that 's one of the points which i do n't see , 
and i do n't like to give any at all 
because the thing is that it 's like if i want something i 'll ask somebody , 
that 's something that you can use . 
and i knew he needed an alarm clock . 
so , i bought him an alarm clock . 
that 's great . utilitarian . 
necessary things , no frivolous gifts . 
once a year you go out 
and you spend all this money on all these people , 
and some you do n't care about , 
that 's true , 
why bother . 
i do n't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving , 
at the end of the semester you 've got finals and lots of bills i would suspect . 
for example , we had spring break now , 
and i went skiing 
and i spent around maybe , two hundred dollars . 
i expect so . 
you 've got to budget that though . 
you 've got to save up in to do that ? 
because it 's like , we were saying , let 's go eat out before spring break . 
i go , let 's not go eat out , before spring break . 
let 's see how much money we have afterwards . 
. 
and if i felt like i spent way to much then i wo n't go out , 
and so my roommate went home , 
but i guess it was worth it , 
sure it is , 
it was a nice place . 
especially if you live on campus , and you do n't have a car , you just go crazy . 
i know the feeling . 
so let 's see how long have we been talking here 
six minutes and a half . 
is that okay ? 
nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
have a good time . 
i have quite a few of those that my uncle made . 
i do n't know if it 's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood 
as you know , i think it 's more like the mess you make , is n't it ? 
you do n't have to worry about cleaning it up . 
because it 's out there . 
i do n't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust , 
and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , 
but then , i get the opportunity to vacuum , 
so i guess i get some of both . 
what are some of your things you like to do ? 
and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing , 
so , a lot of times i 'd help her with that . 
i have n't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately 
we 've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going . 
it 's a good time for gardening . 
it 's been beautiful this last week 
i could do with a little less wind , 
but i think the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside . 
i usually start in the fall . 
that 's kind of what my wife says . 
she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she 's always got something to cover her legs and feet with while she is working on it . 
i think she made three this year one for my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters . 
so , those things they take some time to make . 
i found one that 's real easy , 
i ca n't even remember the name of it now , 
but you make it in strips . 
and it 's real easy to do , 
and it 's just that it does n't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that 
mile a minute . 
that 's the name of it . 
mile a minute . 
mile a minute . 
i 'm not sure what she does 
i guess that is your standard knitting , is n't it ? 
i know , 
if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other , do n't worry about it . 
we have a very small phone company down here . 
instead of call waiting or call anything else . 
we ca n't have that down here . 
we get disconnected all the time . 
i guess that 's one way to end a conversation . 
it gets a little aggravating . 
i 've got kids all over the united states 
and sometimes they get disconnected when i 'm talking to them . 
have you started your garden yet ? 
what else did i get in there , 
always got to have those . 
i think i had four jalapeno plants last year . 
i think one of them died , 
but i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because there is no way that i can eat all of those 
nobody else in the family likes them , 
but always got to keep those planted . 
my husband does n't like them either , 
but i can always give them away . 
that 's kind of the way i am . 
besides they 're fun to grow . 
i planted four hills of them . 
i think i had three or four seeds in each one of them , 
and those things just flat took over . 
it was n't until late in the summer , 
maybe it was because it was too dry , 
and i 'm not sure when a good time to plant those is , if they should be planted early or later . 
i would think so , 
seems like they all went to leaf , 
and it was n't until late in the summer they started making fruit . 
mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon , 
it may not be , 
it may not be . 
you think they 're later in the year ? 
that 's true . 
go ahead . 
i 'm sorry , 
go ahead . 
i was just going to say , it 's a little over six or seven minutes . 
that would be fine . 
just any time . 
and thanks for participating . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
have a good time . 
i guess it 's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust , 
so , i believe them 
but i 'm not a chemist . 
do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial areas , factories and so on ? 
i do n't really know , 
i understand it very well 
and in fact i was a private pilot there , 
it just looked liked peanut butter . 
thick and brown and so on . 
and that was , a few years ago ? 
this was quite a few years ago . 
people say that it is somewhat better . 
and particularly in the winter months . 
they were talking about shutting it down , if it did n't comply and so on . 
did it burn coal ? 
i do n't know that , 
the information is one of those wire services kind of pieces of news , , 
so it 's hard , 
i never did see the full story , 
so i do n't know . 
that 's such a spectacle . 
it would be a shame to ruin it . 
what do you think individuals could do , or society could do to alleviate this problem . 
i do n't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals . 
maybe just take good care of our cars , and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing . 
apart from that , i do n't know what we can do as individuals . 
what do you think we can do ? 
you think , it 's more to society . 
i guess i kind of agree there . 
on an individual basis there is n't a lot we can do about a lot of things 
but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can force government that we elect to deal more seriously with it . 
and i do think that we have a responsibility there . 
i must admit i 'm not always real politically active 
but i do think that congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards . 
the , lobbyist and the car manufacturing companies have really pushed , 
all those restrictions are really too hard , 
we ca n't quite make that go 
and then we still live with air pollution . 
so i suspect that that 's one thing that as individuals , we can do , make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators . 
but as a society , i think we can do more 
and that 's probably how we ought to do it . being individually responsible in order to be group responsible . 
and in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems , and everything else that we 'll spend the money that 's necessary to get rid of the source of it . 
i suspect that there 's going to have to be a lot of pressure come to bear on the companies that deal with it 
and probably the only way that can happen is for governments to realize that they have to pay if companies do n't . 
and i do n't know how long that will take . 
people also have to realize they ca n't have their cake and eat it . 
so , if you do n't want to burn coal for power , how about nuclear energy . 
we do n't want that either . 
how about investing in the sun . 
i probably would n't mind if it really came down to it . 
it 's just the same thing with the gasoline , 
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent 
and they do n't want to pay for it . 
so instead , we spend billions of dollars going to war . 
however , it might have had other causes . 
certainly oil was a big factor . 
and i think that 's probably going to happen with such things as air pollution , 
when we get serious about our motors in our automobiles then maybe we 'll have a little bit of help . 
do you have any air pollution in your area ? 
once in a while we 'll get some , 
you 're talking about from the middle states , that have more factories and so on . 
that 's what they say 
but it 's not very usual 
and certainly we do n't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities . 
we really do n't have that either . 
and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level particularly in the summer . when it gets hot , and you have , that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air usually caused by exhaust . 
it seems to me that i 'm more uncomfortable 
so i suspect that it 's an ever growing problem . 
i suspect that we 've probably covered everything that we need to here . 
i think , we 've given them about seven minutes according to my watch 
it was nice talking to you . 
and i enjoyed the conversation . 
so did i . 
have you lived in this area long ? 
i 've only been here a couple of years . 
but i 've noticed that this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past . 
i remember last year , or the year before we had ice and snow , 
terrible ice storm around this time of the year . 
and this year it 's been so hot and sunny 
it 's really quite amazing . 
and it was the first day of spring , 
it was so much ice that came down , later on that afternoon and evening , 
it was horrible . 
i was just talking to my son today , 
he really wished he could be here , rather than there . 
i do n't know 
i like it warmer , 
i like it warm 
but it does n't really matter . 
i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly 
i think it 's really been delightful . 
i 've spent most of my time in warm weather areas 
and the ice and snow just does n't hold any allure for me at all . 
so i 'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway . 
but i got used to it , 
it was really strange , 
and then we got used to it 
it 's not that it 's just hot or dry , 
it 's just not very comfortable , 
a little bit . 
we were down there 
and , the last day , right before we left , i had to ride with my sister 
and the air conditioning went out on the car , 
and , you just get used to air conditioning all the time , 
and it was just killing us . 
it 's terrible . 
that 's really bad . 
just so mild , 
you 're sweating , 
you look down at your arm , 
but you see the water leaving your arm , 
it 's so hot , you just feel it pulling away , 
bizarre . 
some people say they like to watch the changing of the seasons 
so , it 's kind of a luxury . 
i tend to agree 
but , i do n't know , 
i think , in some respects it probably more tolerable . 
i guess the weather is n't as lively a topic as some of the others we might have gotten . 
i got one topic , 
i 've had some pretty controversial topics 
so it 's just that was my fault . 
it gets pretty mundane , 
you can only talk about the situation just so long . 
i know , 
weather 's just not all that inspiring . 
it 's nice talking to you . 
and i would , 
i like the adventure of it . and the idea that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space . 
they have a new one now . 
and i 've always liked that show probably the very best . 
i 'm certainly acquainted with the characters . 
the movies are good too . 
and i guess most of the shows i like , are kind of along the same line because they 're all adventure . 
when i started thinking about this , those are some of my favorite shows , 
i do n't think i 've even heard of that show . 
you have n't ? 
and what is he ? 
so he does all kinds of strange things like that . 
see what we can come up with . 
and i used to like the show very much . 
some of the little things , 
and i just decided i had to do that . 
i think , in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it , 
and i just realized , i was sort of like an alcoholic , 
if i did n't get the booze out of the house , i was going to drink . 
i guess i have n't ever had any trouble with that . 
i have my favorite shows 
and i usually make time in my day or my week to watch those . 
but , for the most part , i have small kids 
and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they 're up . 
i like that real well . 
i do n't think they have that on anymore . 
that would be a shame . 
i have n't seen the electric company in a long time . 
but they 're not making new ones . 
i have n't seen it in a long time . 
is he still around ? 
i do n't think he 's making new ones , 
but they repeat all the old ones . 
i see . 
i see . 
so that 's still a real good show too . 
and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go , 
the timing of it is good , besides , what 's on . 
i figure your children are preschool ? 
i have two little ones . 
so they like that . 
i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon . 
they come on both . 
they come on from nine to ten and then from five to six . 
and they 're watching something worthwhile , while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot . 
i 'm not sure it was that great for my children , 
but they turned out okay , 
it did n't hurt them any . 
for the imagination of it all . 
for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff . 
i do n't let my little ones watch it , 
but the imagination of , look what we can do 
in the future , perhaps , this will be possible . 
that kind of thing . 
i 'm trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time . 
let 's see , 
how about man from uncle ? 
is that the one where he always got this tape recording that self-destructed ? 
that 's mission impossible . 
that 's right , 
mission impossible . 
i used to watch that . 
in fact , i can still remember a couple of those . 
i thought those were very good . 
i 've seen some of them on repeats . 
they always had a good plot . 
it kind of kept you guessing on , what was going to happen next . 
how they 're going . 
i do remember that . 
and i went to see the movie the doors a couple of days ago , 
and it was very , very funny . 
i do n't know , 
i 'm not old enough to recall that one . 
i guess , i have to admit that i am . 
i see . 
i 'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little . 
that may be why , 
and the shows that i like now , they would n't let me watch . 
i had to catch them all on repeats . 
they thought that was much too violent for small children . 
i ended up watching a lot of these things on repeats in the afternoons or something . 
that 's interesting . 
i think it 's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv , 
maybe even more so . 
but i guess that 's a different topic is n't it ? . 
probably so . 
i think that 's about covered it for me , 
and we 'll talk another time perhaps . 
it was nice talking to you . 
tell me where you 're calling from . 
where are you from ? 
i did n't know they did it long distance . 
i hope they 're trying to do it all over the country , because they need to collect all kinds of different dialects . 
it was nice talking to you . 
same here . 
i think we 're supposed to discuss our view of the soviet union as a continuing threat to the united states . 
how do you feel about that . 
the people i would n't consider to be a threat at all 
and i really do n't feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore . 
i 'm worried about them . 
i 'm concerned about them not as a military threat , but as a burden . 
they 're very large 
i think that 's a real important aspect 
let 's see , 
the more that we can do to help them become self-sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a reality . 
the people there have money , 
that 's not their problem , 
but there 's no food for them to buy , 
you ca n't eat money . 
and they have , a problem , their whole attitude , 
i 'm not sure which crop it was , 
but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they could n't get anyone to harvest it . 
and the people in the city were saying , why should i go do that . 
make the government do that , 
that 's not my job . 
they 've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they 've been through now , 
but they do n't know how to act yet . 
they do n't understand that to make that work , they 've got to take some responsibility for themselves . 
it 's not just the government 's responsibility anymore . 
you ca n't just blame it on the government 
when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well . 
and i think that they 're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back . 
people only go forward 
i 'm expecting a call 
and unfortunately , i think it 's come through . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
thank you , 
real problem the last few days , one of their young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season , 
it was a catcher . 
and they really do n't have an excess of catchers 
they 're not the highest paying ball team around . 
they 're not , are they . 
i would too , 
even the bench warmer , i would . 
that 's right . 
i used to go , take my son , 
when he was in high school , he enjoyed going to baseball games . 
but , i think they 're doing better . 
i do to , 
i can imagine . 
i used to love to play baseball when i was a kid . 
we 're heavy into that too . 
i think it 's more fun to play than it is to watch . 
i do too . 
of course , 
of course . 
as a matter of fact i read in the sports page this morning , 
he just pitched his first exhibition game a day or so ago , 
and he pitched five full innings . 
that was almost unheard of for a pitcher to start out that strong . 
no big deal , 
it 's just part of a day 's work . 
i know it , 
he 's something else , 
he really is . 
they could do very well , 
they sure could . 
i do n't know 
but last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything , 
i really do . 
all their players are signed now . 
some of them are not too happy about it 
at least , that should help , 
that should help . 
it sure should . 
it should . 
and of course , there 's a few more are good ball teams also . 
i really do . 
there sure are . 
that 's right . 
you have n't ? 
i have a few times . 
they 're a good ball team . 
that 's right . 
they really are . 
they sure are . 
would n't it though . 
i tell you 
that would draw a crowd , would n't it . 
would n't it . 
it sure would . 
we might actually get to go to a world series . 
that 's right , 
would n't that be something . 
it sure would . 
that 's something you dream about . 
there sure is 
and they really are . 
but , last year i was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump . 
but they 're saying this year , their predictions is that he 's really going to come out of it and , be on top . 
he 's a bull , is n't he ? 
is n't he though , 
he really is 
he sure is . 
he either hits home run or strike out . 
that 's right . 
there is not ever a in between for him . 
that 's right , 
apparently i think his contract is up after the end of this year 
and they 're not sure they 're going to be able to sign him again . 
to sign him again , 
that may or may not happen . 
you never know . 
that 's right , 
it 's a long way away . 
if you offer them money , i 'm sure they 'll do a little bit of everything . 
that 's right . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
. 
is there going to be a ticket increase this year , 
do you know . 
i had n't heard . 
i have n't either , 
i really have n't , 
those cowboys have increased their prices again this year . 
but i did n't know , 
or i do n't remember it if i have . 
i had n't either , 
we had n't , 
i do n't even guess they 've even thought about sending the schedules out yet . 
i guess it 's too early . 
because we usually get one . 
we usually order our tickets way in advance . 
it 's a good idea , 
we try to go so often . 
if you have young children they get a kick out of it . 
they do . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
and , hopefully we 'll get to talk again . 
you take care . 
you said you have four cats ? 
i have four cats . 
how old are they ? 
they range from about a year and a half to nine years old . 
i have n't had my oldest one quite nine years , 
i 've had him probably five years . 
you get so attached to them . 
i love my cats . 
i lost one , one time , 
the first one i got . 
and he 'd never been outside by himself outside . 
you would have thought a child had died . 
i called everyone i knew , 
i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat . 
i understand . 
and they laughed at me , 
i understand , 
we 've gone through the same things with ours , 
they 've been ill , 
i take off work , to take care of my cats , 
my boss thinks i 'm absolutely crazy . 
and then we had a baby 
and it 's who comes first 
the cat or the baby . 
the cat was here first 
so . i know , 
it 's hard . 
and then when we go to sleep at night it 's like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us . 
how funny . 
it 's whose corners is this one . 
that 's sweet , 
i have the two , 
the other two cats i have are outdoor cats . 
and they did n't used to be actually , 
but they got kind of wild and were n't doing very well inside , 
so i put them outside once i got a house 
and they 're doing great out there , 
they love it . 
but the first one i got he does n't want anything to do with outside unless you 're there . 
other than that he gets scared to death . 
if you shut that door he goes into hiding . 
that 's it . 
he 's probably been through all kinds of nightmares . 
traumatized for life here . 
all four of ours are house cats . 
are they . 
we started out with two outdoor cats 
but our neighbor decided he did n't like cats and shot one of them . 
he lived through it , 
i could n't believe it . 
the cat almost died , 
but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat , 
he loves life now . 
i imagine . 
and he 's thank you so much . 
i wonder how many of his lives he missed , when that happened . 
i know , 
we wondered about that . 
but that was a traumatic experience for us too . 
i can imagine , 
what did he shoot him with . 
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip . 
people are crazy . 
absolutely nuts . 
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery 
he started off as a stray 
and then we did all this for him . 
but he 's been a wonderful cat . 
i imagine . 
they usually are after something like that happens to them . 
it seems to mellow them or something . 
i do n't see us without pets , without cats . 
they just fill this void . 
i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i ca n't take care of them as well because they 're outside , 
and it worries me that one day one of them wo n't come back , 
and i feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things . 
but i ca n't give them up . 
and you worry about who 's taking care of them . 
and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat . 
i did n't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night . 
i had one we had to put to sleep he got so sick . 
and my husband just died . 
it was we ca n't take it back 
we 've got to keep it now . 
it 's here now , 
we have to keep it . 
i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment . 
it took me about two weeks to realize , that was real lonely . 
so i found this one 
and i thought that 's interesting , 
i 'll call them . 
and he was the only one left 
and he was the last one she carried across , 
the whole big sad story . 
so of course , i had to take him . 
i felt so sorry for him after that . 
i asked the vet why he did that 
people who do n't even like cats , like him . 
but he does n't bite anybody 
that 's good . 
we just love them . 
and they 'll come up and just start kneading in our chest 
it looks like they 're kneading bread . 
it just drives us nuts . 
i just love cats . 
i like dogs , 
they 're okay , 
i had a dog when i lived at home 
but they 're a lot more trouble than cats actually . 
they really are . 
the cats are so independent 
and they have so much more personality than a dog . 
they do . 
but they 're so much fun to watch them play . 
they are . 
i love it , 
it 's so funny to get more than one cat together , because it brings out their personalities . 
and they just act so funny . 
the two that were outside , they 're like brothers , 
i 've never seen two cats so close . 
and they will get to playing chase through the house , 
and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit . 
it 's like this train . 
a train of cats running around . 
it sounds like a train . 
we have wooden floors 
and so it just sort of echoes through the house . 
how funny , 
i can imagine . 
i would n't give anything for my cats . 
i love them to death . 
they 're wonderful . 
what are your cats ' names . 
how sweet . 
and what do you have . 
and they do n't look a thing a like . 
nothing . 
precious is a medium hair yellow cat , 
nothing . 
they do n't look a thing a like , 
not a thing . 
and they came from the same litter and everything . 
and she 's so ugly . 
so ugly she 's cute , 
you ca n't help but love her . 
and she 's right there . 
is she the oldest one ? 
she 's the oldest . 
in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also . 
and so 
if something happens to her . 
i know 
it 's like the end of the world . 
it will be . 
you get so attached to them . 
my mother has dogs 
and i 'm no . 
this is nothing like cats . 
you can walk a dog 
and that 's okay for weekend 
but cats are good all the time . 
i 'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person it would n't have worked . 
it would n't have , 
that would be a problem . 
that 's one of the requirements i asked him . 
i said , you do like cats . 
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date 
and there were cats hanging all over him . hanging on his clothes , 
they had ripped him up 
and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom 
he said , of course i love cats . 
and they were just all over him and sitting on his head , the whole nine yards . 
it was so funny . 
the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying , are you getting rid of your cats , 
are you getting rid of your cats . 
you ca n't be pregnant and have cats . 
i 'm . 
watch me . 
the child will learn to like cats . and deal with them , 
i 'm sorry , 
we are not getting rid of the cats . 
i would n't either . 
there 'd be no way . 
the whole family was so disappointed . 
that 's life , 
that 's how life goes . 
but 
we just love them to death . 
i know , 
i love mine too . 
it 's been nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you too , 
i enjoyed it . 
me to . 
how awful . 
it was truly awful . 
it was not one that i picked , 
but it did show some interesting things about the f b i 
because the characters trying to get him were f b i people 
and of the few good things that were in it , it did show a lot about the f b i . about the training , and how they go through training and how they try to develop a mental picture of who they 're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that . 
and it was pretty telling about the f b i and their procedures . 
i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the f b i going . 
they keep it rather secretive , 
two of them actually . 
the rain man was one . 
that was great one . 
was n't that fabulous , 
i loved it . 
i have n't seen that one yet , 
and i need to go see it . 
you need to see that . 
and this all took place in the south . 
you bet , 
especially in the south . 
and it really was a fantastic movie . 
the acting was phenomenal . 
as i recall it got some academy awards , did n't it . 
that 's right . 
it might have one best picture , too . 
it did , 
it did . 
that was , 
it must have been great just being with him on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his lines and all that stuff . 
you better believe it . 
that was so funny , 
that was hilarious . 
unbelievable . 
and everyone feels they are totally retarded . 
that 's right . 
but there 's a lots going on in there . 
it 's amazing . 
and again it was a picture of relationships . 
again the relationship between the two that never would have occurred by accident . 
i was so impressed with that movie 
i saw it three times . 
did you . 
i can tell you so much about that movie , just because it really rang a lot of my personal background . 
i have a brother myself that 's older 
nothing , serious is wrong with him 
but we have gone through these lapses of a relationship , sometimes , 
and then for no real direct reason we get into a really good relationship for a while and then back and forth 
so i was really able to relate to the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers . 
that was neat . 
that 's tremendous , 
it 's good because it does make you think , about your own family . 
a lot . 
and it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother . 
no question , 
he 's one of these guys though that does n't really like to go see movies like that . 
he likes the bang them up and shoot them up things . 
and , it was like pulling teeth to go get him to see it 
but . he gave the best response that i 've heard him give of this type of movie for rain man . 
he only saw it one time , 
and he did n't go back for more , 
but he said he enjoyed it 
he at least saw it one time . 
i do n't know , 
i 'm come on . 
he will do that , to research it and to be able to mimic a person with the kinds of problems that he had . 
i was believing it , 
i do n't know about any body else 
it was great . 
i 'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them . 
he did great . 
it 's just been delightful talking with you . 
you take care up there 
absolutely , 
i 'm ready for it , 
but they 're predicting some more snow for our direction . 
take care . 
take care . 
our community does n't really have any organized recycling drive . 
where do you live ? 
we just built a real big recycling center , that recycles everything imaginable 
but , as far as trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing , they 're testing that . 
so , they 're really not full force into it , 
but they 're trying , 
so we 're attempting it , 
but i wish we could do more . 
i used to work for the power company here 
and there was discussion for a while about building a garbage burning electric generation plant 
but it just was n't cost effective , at the time . 
and there 's little recycling trucks and things throughout the city 
but there is n't any advertising campaign . 
that 's what i do . 
but they make it as hard as possible , 
it 's not very convenient to do . 
we have those which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans . 
i do n't know if you all have those things around . 
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they 're in almost every shopping center , 
and you can just stop by . 
everything else like the paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers 
but for aluminum that 's real nice 
and i started doing that at work . 
i put out a trash can for people to put their aluminum cans in , 
and that 's really helped a lot , 
everybody 's pitched in 
and it does n't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can . 
so , i really like that , 
but , people are really concerned , 
it 's just that sometimes it 's not the right people , which is really , really sad because , i wish we would do more . 
at work we started all the recycling stuff . 
they 're really trying , 
i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year . 
and that really , started a lot of stuff off , 
that 's good . 
but that 's about the extent of it . 
at least you 're trying something . 
it would be nice if it could be more . 
and i 'm sure that the driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so . 
do you really . 
we sell the paper back to a paper manufacturing company . 
that 's a neat idea . 
not by much , 
that 's really good , 
at least they 're trying . 
and i thought , i do n't understand this . 
and here we are wasting . 
and i do n't understand , sometimes , the logic behind it . 
someone moved offices in my building 
i took several home because i 'm moving pretty soon 
and they 're good boxes . 
that 's exactly what i did . 
and they were just going to throw them away . 
exactly what i did , 
exactly . 
because i did n't want to waste that . 
and it 's hard enough to find good packing boxes . 
you can unfold them . 
so they do n't take up much storage space . 
that 's very good . 
i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away , 
i thought , i was doing them a favor by taking them . 
so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes , when these are perfect , 
the ones at the grocery store , half the time , they 've pulled the lid off 
so you ca n't use it anyway . 
and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes . 
that 's exactly what i do . 
those are perfect boxes to put files in . 
they 're good for storage and stuff like that . 
that 's what i do with a lot of my daughter 's things is i 'll store her out dated or , out of season clothes in them 
and they 're just perfect . 
i do n't have any now , 
and you can stack them up and leave them out and put things in them , even . 
and they look just as good . 
that 's a smart idea . 
i think i 'll have to try that . 
that 's really cute . 
it 's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever . 
they 're the exact same thing . 
that 's all they are , 
they just made them look fancy . 
you saved me some money . 
and you 're recycling . 
that 's neat . 
but for newspaper . 
but ours are real hard to find . 
that 's the one thing that really discourages me . 
it 's almost like they do n't want the paper , because they do n't pay , at all , 
they 're real hard to find the places that pay . 
and that 's really discouraging . 
i just go ahead and take it to the regular place , where they just accept it . 
but i think they should 
the aluminum , 
it gets people to , doing it , 
you do n't have to pay them a lot . 
in fact i think there 's two of them , that have several openings , 
and it 's for recycling 
and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category , 
maybe there 's two for aluminum . 
and you do n't get paid 
that 's good . 
at work we have two different trash cans at your desk . 
you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash , 
but in the paper one you have to separate . 
you have to make sure you do n't throw away any of the slick paper , like magazines . 
you ca n't throw any of that away 
and you ca n't throw certain file type things away , 
it seems like it would be easy to take it all , 
i do n't know , 
of course , i do n't know all that about recycling 
but i do get tired of having to separate paper . 
i guess you have to make it a habit , 
you have to get so used to doing it that it 's a habit . 
they come and empty your trash 
every other day they do your normal trash 
and every other day they do your recycling trash . 
and when they were questioned about it they said we 're running late , 
and that 's real discouraging . thinking you 're sitting there working to separate it 
and someone else is n't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags . 
so they 're really , trying to start keeping an eye out for those 
separate them 
because that is discouraging when you do that . 
it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans . 
and they 'll start separating them . 
because , i do n't mind doing that , 
i feel like i 'm doing something for the community when i 'm doing that . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
you too . 
i , thank you . 
the last movie that i saw , 
i do n't go to that many 
so i 'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see , 
have you seen it . 
unfortunately i have n't , 
i heard it 's really good , 
it is . 
he is one of the best actors i 've ever seen . 
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living , more or less , 
but it wears off . 
and then it gets to where he ca n't control his movements at all . 
and it was just so realistic . 
the way you have to just keep reminding yourself that he 's an actor . 
does he have a funny part in it ? 
how does he do serious . 
he 's good , 
he is . 
i 've only seen him in funny stuff 
i know , 
me too . 
but what was that show , 
but that was n't it . 
he was n't always funny in that show , was he . 
i did n't see the movie , 
i read the book 
i did too . 
that 's why i was thinking it could n't be just a totally funny part . 
in fact , it got some pretty serious deep parts in it 
what have you seen ? 
i saw it . 
we 've both seen one . 
did you cry through it ? 
the whole way . 
it was telling a friend , 
but each was about half an hour long , 
where did you cry . 
let 's see , 
and i think from there on , all the way through the movie . 
let 's see 
what other parts . 
i ca n't remember any of the other parts right off now . 
i do n't remember when the horse got killed . 
when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him . 
you can tell i 'm an animal lover , 
you can hear my dog . 
unfortunately we do n't have any animals , 
it was a beautiful story , 
it really was . 
there was a lot of pretty scenery , too , in that movie . 
i thought it was awful , and so graphic , 
that was , 
i had n't even imagined it . 
of course they raise them now to eat . 
it was n't . 
that was great . 
and there were so many of them . 
i did n't know that . 
that was pretty . 
and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape , 
you could follow this beaten down path , 
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing . 
i wonder how they kept up with them , though , 
i know . 
i guess they graze , though , 
that would n't be a problem . 
have you seen any of the behind the scenes of that movie . 
they tried to keep it very close to real . 
that 's the , part they had trouble finding was wolves . 
what , 
they just do n't howl that much anymore . 
. that 'll teach them in a couple minutes . 
and that 's all they 'd have to do . 
that 's funny . 
i think we 've made it . 
is that five minutes , 
i do n't know , 
is it five or three . 
i 'm not sure . 
i 'm not either . 
i think we 've done okay , though . 
me too . 
thank you for calling . 
thank you . 
you too . 
back by that . 
there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of how women have changed , 
look at them , 
so many women are heads of state 
and we keep saying we feel some day a woman will be president . 
but i have some question , whether or not they will ever really get around to that . 
i think we 'll have a black president before we have a women president . 
and i do n't know whether that 's bad or good , 
i truly believe that before that we have to address the racial issues in the united states , before we can go anywhere . 
i think , we 're supposed to hang up . 
it was n't the matter of wealth , 
it was the matter that they were not wealthy , that made them equal . 
i 'll talk to you later , 
thank you . 
could you tell me what you think contributes most to air pollution ? 
it 's hard to say . 
while it 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories pollute a lot if you look at how much pollution is kicked up by an active volcano it 's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all . 
what do you think ? 
i think probably the greatest cause is vehicles , especially around cities . 
do you live right in the city itself ? 
i 'm more out in the suburbs , 
but i certainly work near a city . 
how about you ? 
i live in a rural area . 
it 's mainly farms and no heavy industry . 
i see . 
and , it 's in the north , 
i live up in the northeast corner 
but there is n't a lot of heavy industry . 
there 's the freeways 
so we 'll pick up that . 
we live about twenty miles away from the state airport 
and i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger , 
and , it seems like we 're catching all that residue . 
but , other than that we do n't have the emissions from the power plants . 
you mean from the coal . 
there does n't seem to be much emission from them , 
but i 'm not sure about the rest of the country . 
it 's interesting 
is that right ? . 
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood 
during the night seems like they 'd blow off their stacks from the warehouses , for powerhouses , 
and , they do that at night too , because , employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted , 
and spots all over them . 
so , you 're right , 
they could do something about that , i guess . 
that seems a little ridiculous . 
how are your lakes , 
they 've been getting cleaner . 
they have ? 
but 
i 'm not sure how much the water pollution is directly related to the air pollution , other than acid rain , 
acid rain , 
the stuff i 've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit overstated . that a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all . 
i 'm not an expert . 
up here ? 
i have n't read that . 
and they thought that was more beneficial because some of it does soak in 
and some of it runs off right away in to the streams and rivers 
and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback . 
i ca n't remember where 
i read that recently somewhere , 
and i ca n't remember where . 
but i thought it was up there . 
you kind of think it 's something else then ? 
that 's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article . 
they did n't say what though , 
they did n't say what , 
they just said they thought acid rain 's contribution may be less than was previously suspected . that it may be other natural things at work . 
natural disease , 
so it 's less than clear . 
like i said , i do n't remember the article that well . 
but i do n't know , 
what do you think we can as individuals or as a group , do about air pollution ? . 
we can demand more efficient automobiles for one thing . 
i still think that 's , one of our major causes of pollutants . 
how we go about that it 's a little bit difficult . 
do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem . 
and the new cars is , hardly anything . 
they 're better , 
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there . 
but does n't that just mean they 're out of tune . 
i 'm not really sure . 
fuel is one of their biggest costs . 
but diesel engines . 
diesel engines . 
they do generate a lot of soot 
we could also push for legislation for rapid transit systems . 
this country seems to be a little behind on that . 
on the other hand most people do n't use rapid transit because it 's so inconvenient . 
but only because we got used to single person , single car , driving . 
that 'll help , air pollution , 
so that 's helping . 
what do you think about a device , a meter right on a tail pipe 
and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted ? 
that 's an idea . 
do n't say that too loud though because every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating revenue , 
it just means if you do n't pollute or you pollute very little you do n't have to pay any tax 
or you just buy one of these things 
maybe you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe 
and the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts 
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe 
and you could n't start your car anymore . 
that 's an interesting concept . 
is that your idea ? 
i guess the difficulty would be that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again 
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something . 
it could be installed like a catalytic converter . 
i guess you could take those off too 
not unless it was built into every muffler . 
that 's quite a concept . 
you should pursue that or patent it . 
patent it , 
that 's a good idea . 
if you could come up with a device that 's the thing . 
but it should n't be too hard to do something like that . 
but that 's a thought . 
you 're right 
and that will solve a lot of problems . 
i do n't know if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that . 
you might generate some interest in it . 
the automobile regulatory agencies or something . 
but that 's a good idea . 
other than that i 'm not sure what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization . 
what do you like to cook ? 
i like to cook foods i like to eat . 
and i find that that 's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals , type things and , they 're kind of convenient . 
that would be good for a dinner party , to cook that because you do n't have to deal with eight different things , coming out at once . 
is that what you usually cook when you have a party . 
i usually have parties that are smaller groups . 
and so 
i guess i usually do . 
i like to cook heavy sauces , and noodles and pasta and such . 
that sounds good . 
fattening . 
how about you , 
what do you like to cook ? 
it 's funny that we 're talking about this , 
we just had a dinner party 
our senior pastor and his wife came over . 
and i catered to their diet is the only thing , though , 
so it was n't something i really wanted to make . 
and there 's salad 
but it 's real hard to make them . 
i do n't know why . 
i do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe i have 
that 's what i want . 
that 's what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that 
it 's really good , 
but instead i catered to their diet 
and it was good and everything , 
it had all the vegetables in it , 
it . 
because i guess i feel like if they 're on a diet like that , i 'm going to honor that , 
another couple came over a couple weeks later 
what did i make that night . 
i made a roast , 
i ca n't believe this 
my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday . 
i ca n't believe that . 
and normally we do n't eat like that during the week because of the calories and the fat in it . 
but when we 're having guests , we just kind of say , just do it . 
and we had extra crust with it , 
it was so fattening . 
that sounds good . 
but , i do n't think we gained any weight from it 
every once in a while i think i feel the same way . 
a lot of women will turn down dessert if it 's too rich simply because they do n't want the extra calories , 
so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play , sometimes . 
and she did n't eat it . 
that 's good . 
anyway , so i guess that 's about what i did when i entertained . 
so , do you have anything else you want to say about it ? 
nothing comes to mind right off , 
so i guess not . 
it was nice talking to you . 
you too . 
i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed that , 
and he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support , 
or he left almost no alternative . 
that 's right . 
and it was very interesting how he did it 
and i 'm an air force officer , 
so it was interesting for me , 
i have friends of mine from the air , 
so , we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there 
and they 're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it . 
that 's great , 
if you remember , the vote in the congress to authorize war , if necessary , was actually pretty close . 
it was . 
i do n't know the exact figure 
but i would imagine that because of how close the vote was almost certainly would have to be . 
that 's right . 
especially the ones that came out and said come on guys , let 's talk about this little while longer . 
how many years are we going to wait 
and what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time . 
no doubt . 
everyone was discussing whether we should wait longer , 
but , i know that there 's a lot of reasons to wait longer 
but i think we were genuinely concerned about their military capability 
and i think we over estimated it , 
but still , we were really , highly concerned about it 
i think so too . 
and , we were worried that they were getting dug in 
they were , 
and in fact they were so well dug in that when we sent our tanks around behind them they could n't get turned around in time . 
it 's true 
had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor . 
that 's right , 
that 's true . 
that 's interesting , 
interesting . 
i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago , 
and now he is a conservative , 
and that concerns me greatly . 
i support that . 
i think that is a positive thing for them after thousands of years , 
when they became a country they more or less decided they were n't going to take it anymore , 
they did n't have much choice , 
they could either fight or die . 
and so 
i lost my train of thought here . 
so , 
i 'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region 
and looks that the joining of forces for this desert shield and desert storm thing ended up being a positive thing . 
it is a positive thing , 
and so you basically have mutually exclusive interests , 
and i 'm just not sure that there 's going to be any easy permanent solution . 
they end up becoming divisive themselves . 
it 's interesting , 
it is . 
i 'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months , 
i know , 
that 's absolutely unprecedented 
that was , an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the president and the state department . 
and that 's never happened before , 
and i do n't know if it will ever happen again 
may not . 
it 's been fun , 
i enjoyed talking with you . 
i guess maybe the computer will pair us up together another time . 
you never know . 
what are your music interests ? 
just about any kind of music except acid rock , 
i do n't care , for acid rock , 
me , too . 
but i grew up with country and western , 
i did , too , 
but just about any kind of music . 
i even like classical music . 
i 'm pretty diversified , too . 
i do n't like acid rock either . 
i grew up in a small town 
so we only had one radio station 
so it was country music , 
you 're older than i am . 
we do n't get channel two . 
our cable does n't , 
i wish we got that , 
that is fabulous . 
was it ? 
we do n't get channel two . 
and it was tremendous . 
actually , i did , 
so , i appreciate his too , 
it was just fabulous . 
he is really good . 
i come from a musical background , 
so , i have a big appreciation for music , up to a point . 
i 'm getting now to the age where i do n't like much of the new stuff that 's coming out , 
my husband says i 'm getting old . 
do you ? 
i love to just lay back on the couch and turn a good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen . 
that 's nice to do , that is . 
i 've never played an instrument in my life , 
i 've always wanted too , 
i 've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something , 
but but i 'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music 
i was one of the forced ones . 
i could never do that . 
i was never that brave 
but . 
i guess the closest i 've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir . 
i 've done that at church too . 
i have n't done that in a long time . 
so , let 's see 
what kind of music do you not like ? 
like i say the acid rock , 
an i do n't care for rap music either . 
that 's not music , 
that is not , 
i do n't know what that is , 
but that 's not music . 
if i ca n't understand the words i do n't want to listen to it . 
it 's not music , 
it 's just , talking in a beat , 
it 's not exciting at all 
it does n't give you relaxation , 
you ca n't dance to it , 
you ca n't do anything to it . 
and i like orchestra music too . 
have you ? 
are they good ? 
they 're good . 
are they ? 
i have , never been . 
the music in that was fantastic . 
i heard that was hard to get tickets to . 
i ca n't remember how far in advance we reserved , tickets 
but it was out at the state fair music hall 
and it was well worth the price . 
was it ? 
i bet it was , 
i really bet it was . 
just ever so often a real good one like that one 
that would be nice . 
i went and saw sugar babies , 
that was good , 
that had good music in it . 
was it ? 
i do n't know what that 's about . 
what 's that not real old dancer , 
i ca n't think of her name . 
i got it right on the tip of my tongue and ca n't say it , 
i know who you 're talking about , 
real long legs , and dark hair . 
she 's got black hair , 
i know who you 're talking about . 
i ca n't think ever her name either . 
i ca n't think of it . 
i remember that being here a few years ago . 
the last country music , 
my parents still really like country , music 
my husband likes country music real well 
and 
i think they 're a bit over exposed . 
i never have either , 
we watch those award shows too , 
but i just do n't care for him , 
i just never have . 
is it ? 
i think , i know who that is , 
i think my parents have , some of his records . 
but i had some , , 
i sold some of them , 
i do n't know if you were old enough to remember him . 
i 've heard the name . 
he played in the old western movies . 
i never have . 
those go back quite a way . 
i took them up here to collectors records and was able to get a little money for them 
but my mother and dad use to own a restaurant , 
it 's hard , 
and when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records 
that 's neat . 
that would be great if they were n't too worn out , at the time . 
is there not ? 
you 'd think there would be . 
the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because , you have to have that particular kind of needle 
that 's true . 
that 's a shame 
because we go to antique stores a lot 
i 'm sure you could find old players for them 
but that would cost a fortune , if you could find them that worked . 
those things were big and thick were n't they ? 
you could kill somebody with them . 
warped real easy . 
go out and buy one now and they 're just so thin and , flimsy 
and they 're not meant to last , at all , 
neither are tapes . 
we buy cassette tapes , 
and machines will eat them , 
and so , the best bet , these days are compact disk , 
so that 's all you had to listen to was the , radio , 
radio . 
that 's just what you had , 
i think it was better back then to , 
and the radio is more exciting , really , than television , 
was it on the radio every week ? 
what day was that on , 
can you recall . 
what do you think about the idea of having volunteer service for everyone ? 
i think that really it would n't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service . 
and there have been so many people that have done it 
and i 've talked with several 
and i think they 've gotten a lot out of it . 
are you doing any kind of volunteer work now ? 
not right now , 
but i have done red cross work 
when would people do it , 
when they finished high school ? 
i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal , because a lot of times , if they go straight into college i think they 're going in too quick 
in fact i was n't very mature when i left high school 
and i think there 's a real challenge there . 
there 's also this issue of , whether you 're really ready , 
and i think it gives a different perspective . 
i think if you 've been out of school a year , year and a half , before you start to college , you appreciate college more , than someone that just goes right straight into college . 
the only complication is how do you fund something like this ? 
a lot of parents fund their children . 
there are some groups that have their children go away for a year . 
even the religious organizations . 
and the parents fund them for the whole year , year and a half that they 're gone . 
it 's interesting . 
it gets them away from home and gets them to do something useful , 
we were doing some investigating colleges 
and said the kids are much more interested today in trying to find a job , study something that will give them a job as opposed to 
if there was mandatory , you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary , 
do you think that would be reasonable ? 
i think it would . 
i was in the military , 
and i personally feel if they have the draft , that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men . 
what would you have them do ? 
there 's a lot of unemployment right now . 
what would you have these people do if they were brought in ? 
what , 
into the service ? 
say that it was mandatory . 
my father was in the c c c . 
he was in that ? 
it 's not the best thing in the world , 
but it gave them something to do . 
it seems that there 's some things like the programs . 
or go into the more depressed areas and help repair the houses . 
in fact , we helped with help to help humanities , 
and that was a good experience , 
but you take the kids out 
it would be a good idea . 
we 've been doing this three or four minutes . 
do you have any other further comments ? 
not really . 
i 'll talk to you later . 
have a good night . 
where to start . 
i have n't had that much , of course 
i just heard , 
but i have n't had that much time to think about it , either . 
i guess the biggest thing i find is the financial aspects particularly , the ability of people to access your financial records or your credit rating almost at will . 
that 's true . 
i did n't think about that . 
and of course using your social security number , of course , permits people to do that 
and almost anything you do now , a social security number is required . 
and of course there 's another aspect of this , too in terms of invasion of privacy 
i just thought about it , 
being a professional of course , you probably belong to one or more professional organizations , 
and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing lists which i think is an invasion of privacy . 
i agree . 
i get some of these things in the mail that i wonder , where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name . 
it 's funny because i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call , 
but i have n't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything , 
but , when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it , your salary information , i just have a real hard time doing that , 
and you hate to send something off with your name and address and what types of things do you own and what kind of money do you make 
and not only that , 
it opens you to phone solicitations 
i got one tonight about six thirty when i sat down to eat dinner , 
carpet cleaning . 
i 've had them for carpet cleaning , 
i 've had them of course , for real estate investments 
you get send in this particular card 
and you get a free trip or something along those lines . 
and i know that a lot of these , of course , are random phone calls 
they just start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers , 
but some of them are sold , 
there is one particular group to which i belong 
and for some , reason they have three different names for me . 
the address is the same 
my office address . 
they have one under my first name and middle initial , 
then they have a third one under just my two initials . 
and i get mail here at home under each of those names . 
so i know that they have sold their mailing list . 
and i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy . 
i think i dislike the phone number part the worst . 
it 's one thing to get junk mail because you can just put it right in the trash , 
but it 's the phone calls , 
and usually when they call you , it 's going to be right when you sit down to dinner because they pretty much know that you 're at work all day 
and they call you right when you 've just gotten home from work . 
but if it 's a salesperson , it 's just something you do n't want to have to mess with . 
and i 've gotten a lot of them lately , 
sometimes i come home from work 
and there 's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine 
and i 'm just assuming it 's probably a salesman that called during the day 
and , i was n't home , 
and they 'll probably call me up and call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on , 
but i find that very annoying . the mail stuff , 
but it 's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls . 
even if friends call it irritates me . 
so she 'll why are you cutting off the phone , 
i might get an important phone call , 
i 'm single , 
but when i come home from work , there 's times i need to pay bills , 
i need to balance my checking account , 
i need to do all kinds of different things like that , 
and even though it 's friends calling , sometimes you just feel like , this is my quiet time , 
i need to get things done 
but that 's where answering machines are nice , because if it 's really important they 'll leave a message 
and i can call them back . 
that 's right . 
but at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in , 
and phone rings like crazy 
and you come home 
and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone . 
and if it 's some salesman , that just makes it even that much worse . 
i get to where i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone , 
now we have a voice mail system at the office . 
a ring at all . 
that 's an idea . 
or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to the office . 
and so it makes it convenient . 
on our system , and on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service . 
ours is that way , too . 
and when i want to be not bothered during the day , that 's exactly what i do . 
that 's it , 
that 's what we have . 
i knew there was some type of a tie in there . 
i think we did , 
that 's good . 
i did n't think we could go too far on this privacy thing , 
but i guess it 's close enough . 
thank you for calling . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
take care . 
you want to start ? 
i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged 
and therefore , having seen the last generation , i guess it gives me a perspective on that . 
i , am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women both in society and in the work place , 
and i guess that 's a significant change that i 've both participated in and noticed . 
i agree , 
and you see women going off to wars as well as men . 
i have wondered why they allowed , or let both the father and mother go , 
and the children are left without either parent . 
to me that 's kind of a drawback . 
but i guess it 's a price you pay . 
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the day care centers . 
wonder about them in what way ? 
from what i understand there 's been studies that these children are more rebellious . 
they term it as more creative . 
but that they are much more contentious . 
i have not , to be honest , had much experience , with children in that situation . 
so i guess my experience is just with what we did 
and so they did n't really go through the child care route . 
they were able to be home together . 
and we never actually experienced that . 
in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the next generation or so , i guess i anticipate an increasing equality greater presence of women in management roles 
i just do n't know . 
what do you mean ? 
not to be crass about it , but whether one might conceive of the possibility that there might be a kind of a professional mother , person . for instance , 
that 's strange . 
and i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting story or whatever . 
i do n't think i have a philosophical problem with that . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
i do n't have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not . 
my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent . 
i do n't know that i felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs . 
i do n't have boys , 
that did n't bother me , 
never has . 
maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care . 
it would be a sort of day care , 
but it would be more of a family setting . 
to come in and live with them ? 
i could easily envision that . 
to come in and live with them ? 
or to put their child into a home setting , where they would leave at eight in the morning and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids 
and you were paying for really high quality care . 
and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that 's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years . 
and then you might have more control over the morals that they would be taught rather than in a classroom or a day care center . 
i know the day care centers are not cheap either . 
i have n't ever really looked at them . 
are you aware at all , of what they cost ? 
i know several single mothers who absolutely ca n't afford it . 
and you have to pay that whether you 're on vacation and taking care of the children or if the children are at home , sick . 
that is just a rate that you have to pay 
i think , i really do n't have a vision . 
that 's okay , too . 
i think that they will be more in the work place because the door 's open . 
and it 's just human nature to walk through an open door . 
and i would be glad to see that . 
but , it seems in my experience i 'm running across single women all the time . 
and that is a little troublesome . because the pressures on them are , rather formidable . 
it 's awful . 
and maybe that 's a change we 'll see . 
maybe the possibility of women who deliberately say , we 'll let the man take care of the children perhaps , in the event of a separation or whatever . 
i think we 've done it . 
i think we 're about done . 
thank you very much . 
it 's been interesting . 
you take care . 
what do you think about the idea of kids having to do public service work for a year ? 
i think it 's a pretty good idea . 
i think they should either do that , or afford some time to the military , or helping elderly people . 
i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help 
and i 'm not sure that that 's not a bad idea 
that 's true . 
i think it teaches kids how to grow . 
how about yourself ? 
i agree with you . 
and they did , do a lot of public service activities , 
parents are n't encouraging their kids to do things like that . 
that 's really great . 
they are 
kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that , 
they do . 
and they do n't follow it at all . 
senior . 
senior , 
once they get into junior high it just , not done anymore . 
they lose interest . 
and then when they young adults , there 's even less interest there . 
me . 
grab , grab , grab , walk out . 
you 're absolutely right . 
i think it 's really a good thing . 
of course , there 's third world countries that can use all kind of help . 
but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country , too . 
but i think , we ought to start right here at home . 
i 'm not so sure that helping overseas would be such a hot idea for , a lot of young people . 
i think that we need to really address what we 've done here 
and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook . 
it 's been really good . 
we talked about this for a few minutes , 
and hopefully , we 'll have other good topic maybe another call someday , 
but i do n't really have too much more to say on this topic , i guess . 
i agree with you . 
i guess we both agree that it 's a good thing , that they should do sometime . 
you take care , 
and , enjoy the day . 
you , too . 
you , too . 
how do you usually keep up with current events ? 
and then i supplement that with radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week , and a newspaper if i have time . 
do you , 
i do n't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday , 
so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and try to catch one of the morning talk shows , 
so , i try to catch that , if nothing else . 
that 's true , 
are you pleased with the news coverage that you 're receiving ? 
we live in a kind of small town , 
but i think we get excellent local coverage , 
and i like the national news that we see , 
and i think they do a real good job . 
so , i 've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get , 
how about you ? 
on the whole , i 'm pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts . 
there seems to be more and more of it , 
and i understand the void that comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations 
but i think there 's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us , 
and like you said , save the commentaries because i 'm going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions . 
i do n't really need their help to do that . 
we 're certainly in agreement there . 
maybe they 're a little more efficient , or have more to do over that same time frame . 
i do n't know which that answer is . 
do you watch that ? 
i used to , 
but i do n't anymore , maybe once or twice a year . 
and ever since that time i just do n't watch . 
so , i guess we have the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not . 
so , i started questioning just how bias they really were , 
i do n't know how old you are , 
so , i do n't know if you 're familiar with him or not . 
not really , 
in the last few years just his kind of informal segments i 've seen 
but i never got to see his actual nightly news . 
and he did a pretty good job . 
but on the nightly news , now , he goes into his commentary 
and that 's where i get into the problem with him . 
i frequently disagree with his commentaries , 
once they 've reported the facts , 
all they can offer is an opinion anymore . 
what did you think of the news coverage of the war ? 
i almost felt like it was too much . 
i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening . 
i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst , 
did that help you understand a lot what was going on 
your prior experience with the military did , 
but i think it helps me everyday in trying to review the state that the world is in and try to guess where we 're going . 
what weekly magazine do you look at , 
at one time or another i 've taken them all for a year . 
i believe in giving anything a chance . 
but i keep coming back to that one , 
so , that 's kind of my favorite . 
it 's primarily a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports . 
that sounds good 
if you were short on time , you could get a summary real quick . 
it too is one 
in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways , 
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom . 
and it 's one of those that i can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i 'm going to spend in there . 
and it just seems to fit nicely , so that i can get it read in about three days . 
for the last couple of months we got an introductory subscription , 
so , we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like glamour or sports illustrated . 
so , we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us . 
to broaden your horizons , make you think about different things anyway . 
it ca n't hurt , . 
anytime that we stop and think it ca n't hurt . 
i try to catch it because it 's another example , 
they just show you the words and the facts 
and they do n't offer any commentary , 
and it gives me a quick chance to be caught up during the day . 
because we do n't listen to the radio at work at all . 
so , i do n't like to go the whole day without hearing anything . 
i 'm with you , 
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is talking fingers , 
do you have that ? 
you have different telephone numbers that you can dial , 
and then you dial in an access code 
and depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update , it will give you updated information . 
that can give you current news updates , current weather updates , things like that 
and it 's offered through the local phone company free of charge . 
so , that 's , an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use . 
it does sound very interesting , 
it really is nice because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and find out about . 
maybe our phone company out here will get around to , offering something like that . 
so , that is something you might keep your eyes open for , 
i think it 's catching on throughout the country . 
who 's your favorite team ? 
who do you think ? 
they did have a fairly decent year finally this year . 
at least they 're coming around . 
they 're going to get better . 
. 
that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year . 
i do n't even know who your favorite team is , actually . 
i think i did know that , 
i just forgot . 
and they have n't been doing too hot , 
in fact the cowboys got the best end of that deal . 
he was a good player . i guess , 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know , 
for a while there 
i 've never been over impressed with him . 
he 'd get past six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone . 
but i guess you never could really see him play , because with the cowboys , while he was with the team , the rest of the team was pretty poor 
so you could n't really tell if it was just him or the team 
and i always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team . 
but , i do n't know . 
he 's been doing real good . 
i 'm pretty impressed with him so far . 
did he actually play in the pro bowl . 
i remember he was a backup 
and then somebody got injured 
and he was supposed to go . 
i 'm not sure . 
i have n't been keeping up with football , 
in the fall i can go on and on about football , 
but since it 's kind of off season , it 's kind of hard to think back about all that . 
i have no idea . 
no earthly idea . 
he was going to keep him as the coach somehow , 
but i do n't know , 
how did they end up this year ? 
they started out really bad , 
they went one and six , 
and then they won five or six in a row . 
and they screwed up the last couple of games . 
kind of like the cowboys . 
except i think the cowboys are on the upswing . 
just had n't heard much about them lately . 
in fact they were doing better than the cowboys , 
and the cowboys came on strong at the end of the season , 
and the cardinals got killed by the cowboys , 
the cardinals , 
i do n't know . 
i think the cowboys probably have a better team . 
of course , he sat along the sidelines all season , 
he never really got in a game , never did a whole lot . 
he did n't get to see much action . 
but , too bad . 
because he had a shot and did n't look too good 
and so , no one 's going to have much faith in him any more . 
in fact , i think they 're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback . 
i have n't kept up with it lately , 
but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody , 
but it was n't anybody i 'd really heard of . 
who is it , 
so , sounds like he 's going to be all right for next season . 
it was his shoulder that he had the problems with ? 
i do n't know . 
i think it was . 
i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on . 
but . 
but i got my thirty day notice yesterday . 
thirty day notice for what ? 
i 'm done , where i work . 
i guess we ca n't talk much more about that , 
but i just thought i 'd throw that in there . 
what . 
maybe i 'll call you back after the recording is finished . 
actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes . 
i ca n't remember . 
i 've always ran out of time ever since i 've done this . 
i usually have , too . 
they always say you 've talked your ten minute limit . 
i 've done that once or twice . 
i did n't look at the clock when we started talking , 
so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in . 
make sure we get our cash flow . 
this was a long time ago . 
that 's about it , 
i think i was into the cardinals for a little bit 
of course . 
i guess i 've always been a cowboy fan . 
other than that when you grow up in a city that has one of the greatest football teams until the last few years , you kind of tend to get caught up in it . 
there 's no question about that , 
it was really exciting , growing up when the cowboys were really big . 
because my parents would always have season tickets , 
and they 'd go to all the games , 
and the hype were just unbelievable . 
but i 'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys , cowboys , cowboys , and super bowl , and all this other stuff . 
i 'm not going to decide i do n't like them just because they 're having a few bad years . 
i think they 'll pull out of it , 
and they 'll wind up being good again . 
they 've got lot of really good young players that are going to , do pretty good , i think . 
but , they 're raising prices on their tickets . 
so they 're banking on doing good next season . 
again . 
what are they going up to , 
thirty bucks or something ? 
first of all it was all one price . 
just on the lower levels is the highest price , 
and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , 
and then from the twenty to the ten yard line . 
and then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas , 
and then the cheapest of course is going to be the direct end zones . 
but they have about four or five different prices now , that they 're structuring it with , 
but obviously they 're all going up more or less is what it 's going to do . 
so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year . 
i 'm not sure , 
i 'm not positive , 
i did n't really think about that . 
that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper . 
but , not that i 'll ever go . 
i had n't been to a cowboys game , 
and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , 
and if they 're not going to use them they 'll give them to somebody else . 
so i went with my dad to a game that one time . 
it was kind of different , i guess . 
and before that it 's been quite a few years . 
i 've been wanting to go to a game , 
i just never have gotten around to it . 
so maybe this year . 
that 's interesting , 
i almost lost our electricity here . 
there . 
how 'd you find out about this ? 
and that 's how we learned about it , 
and so i took a class , 
and he said , sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes . 
so are you ready ? 
i 'm ready . 
let 's get started . 
if i knew that i 'd be a very wealthy person . 
but what are the steps ? 
you have to see , 
the way i look at it , you have to think first of all why , 
or has crime increased , 
and if so , why has crime increased ? 
the problem is that what happens is that as you go from the country to a city , crime always increases ? 
because in the country , people still respect the property of other people . 
and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city . 
what happens is all those that do n't have any money in the country move to the cities , 
and they rush to get the same thing . 
they say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have , 
and the thing that we can do is , we need money for drugs , 
and what we have to do is , we have to go get some stuff , steal it , and then just resell it . 
it 's easy , 
you said the magic word there . 
which one ? 
drugs . 
and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased . 
that 's , the main reason i think everywhere 
because you have deaths . 
you have murders 
and you have people stealing other people 's stuff , 
a lot of it has to do with drugs . 
the thing is that it 's like you might be standing somewhere , 
and let 's say you 're driving out 
and you 're driving back home 
and it 's late at night . 
and somebody walks in there with a gun . 
they 're going to want the money , 
and you can tell by the people who are always caught , that these people are there to get money for drugs . 
they do n't want the money so they can do something else with it . 
they do n't want the money for food , 
that 's for sure . 
and we 're just really now , trying to figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge . 
it 's like , compared to , weapons or stuff like that you 're spending nothing on crime in the country itself . 
it 's like , you have other things , 
you have the aids 
we 're going to , try to solve the aids problem while , some people are getting killed here and there 
and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs , may be part of the power structure that 's keeping us from spending the money in that direction . 
but those people never get caught . 
that 's right , 
they 'll never get caught . 
their theory is that if i 'm surrounded , and i 'm going to be caught , i 'm going to try to find my way through , 
and they 're not going to take me alive . 
but i have such a big army outside of my place , that nobody can touch me . 
that 's right . 
of course i might be the leading drug dealer here , 
but you wo n't find me dealing in drugs , 
there 's no connection between me and the people that were caught . 
that 's right . 
that 's right , 
one person does n't know the other person down the line . 
but the guy at the very top , the one who 's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure and had the political pull to keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing , 
because it sure is monstrous in this country . 
and this guy comes over , 
he goes , how you doing , 
he started talking to me , 
and he 's got his little brother selling drugs . 
and he goes , i just came up here to work , 
and i go , you did , 
you make very good money up here . 
he goes , i make , a lot of money , 
and in the movie good fellows . 
did you see it ? 
i only heard about it . 
in one part , the guy goes out of jail , 
and within two months , he has all his house payments gone everything paid , 
it 's like , those guys , at one point they had so much money that they did n't know what to do with it . 
that was also in the movie . 
been nice talking with you . 
we 've been talking for five minutes ? 
we 've been talking for a little bit . 
i appreciate the call . 
i enjoyed talking with you . 
same here . 
i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute . 
credit cards that 's an easy topic , 
is n't it . 
it is . 
it 's one we all hold dear and near , i 'm sure . 
i guess i 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them . 
most of mine 's been pretty good , although i guess i 'm like a lot of other people , now , 
i 'm trying to pay off my credit cards 
and , i 've done pretty good at it . 
i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want not need , want . 
there is a big difference . 
there 's a big difference there . 
but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline . 
i do that , 
i do that , 
like i said , the rest of them i 've been trying to pay off and get back on a cash basis , except for gas . 
it 's too easy to run into the gas station . 
it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything , that way . 
at least that 's for me . 
but 
i 've talked to some who 's really had some bad experience 
and i have n't yet , 
not bad . 
i 'm just shocked at the end of the month , to see what damage i have did , 
but , i try to keep it pretty reasonable . 
i 've been pretty lucky in that respect . 
like i say , i 've , been trying to not charge except for emergencies . 
but i have n't really had any bad problems with credit cards . 
they have wonderful features , 
they 're there when you need them like in emergencies , or whatever . 
and then they have bad drawbacks , too high interest , 
it 's like paying twice . 
that 's true , 
that 's true , 
i did switch to one sponsored by the credit union , though . 
that seems to be a pretty low interest . 
compared to some of the other ones . 
and you do n't have an annual fee there , 
and that helps . 
we used to have several , 
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in . 
that 's one way to do it , because that forces you to pay for it instead of saying , i 'll just pay on it this month 
i know , 
takes a long time , 
that 's right . 
it sure does . 
of course it 's been going down for a number of years , 
but this is the last year you can take anything . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
and maybe we 'll get to talk again . 
how do you feel about it ? 
i do n't have any strong convictions about it , 
that 's for sure . 
i know i have n't done any peace corps service , 
and i do n't know anybody in my immediate family that has ever even thought about it . 
do you know anybody that 's been ? 
but i think that 's a terrible idea . 
that 's like forcing someone to donate to a charity . 
and it 's nice to try to teach young people some , civil consciousness , 
it 's definitely up to the person , 
so , i 'd have to say that the people who do it , some feel it 's rewarding . 
i do n't know , 
but i do n't know how we got the subject . 
i do n't either . 
i have nothing to say about this . 
i do n't either . 
i almost hung up , because i thought , i do n't really have an opinion except for no , 
i think that 's dumb . 
i 've been here for just almost four years . 
that 's how we know each other . 
and you were just up there then . 
last weekend . 
had a good old time . 
that 's good . 
back to the topic at hand . 
what other types of community service would they be talking about . 
the recording mentioned the peace corps . 
this is major long term commitment a year or six months , 
or i do n't know , 
i 'm all for donating my time to worthy causes , 
i do some volunteer work here and there , 
and every once in a while i 'll do a local big brother big sister thing . 
or i 'll go do a . 
but that time is minuscule compared to what , they were referring to . 
i could n't possibly commit a year or two of my life to go do something . 
they could n't cover my hourly rate . 
i could n't afford it . 
i have this thing against bugs , too . 
i 'd probably catch a terrible disease and die . 
. i doubt that , 
but , you know how it is . 
it would have to be tough going somewhere you do n't know the culture , usually , i guess . 
i think that maybe that 's why some people do it is to see the other cultures and some of that . 
but to do that , 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know either . 
growing up , all i knew was you go to high school , you work , you go to college , you get out of college , and you get a good job and you work . 
and none of this , you go spend two years in the peace corps to broaden your horizons . 
and they 're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off . 
so , it is something that i think even the larger organizations will support . 
it 's really for the community to give back to the community type of thing . 
i do n't know , 
kind of like joining the military . 
in that respect a lot of people join the military to grow up and to decide what they want to do , 
and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as that kind of a time . 
maybe a little bit in that perspective , 
and a lot of people have gone in the military when they 're in the college . 
sometimes it 's to help support college the money . 
others , people do n't know what they want to do . 
but as far as the peace corps . i suppose there 's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives . 
but i think a lot of it 's when people get older , they 'll do something like that . 
i 'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the peace corps . 
but i do n't . 
i do n't . 
did n't mean to cut you off there . 
that 's okay . 
so i do n't really know anyone first hand that 's committed a chunk of their life to do service work . 
everybody i know has been , i 'm going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car . 
or try to make a living . 
i do n't know anybody that 's done that either . 
it 's interesting we got this topic because i do n't know what i marked off to get this , 
i certainly did n't mark off anything to get this one . 
i ca n't imagine , 
and the last time i called it before it went down , i had this topic , 
and i did n't feel like talking about it , 
so i hung up , 
and i guess they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it . 
so you had the same one . 
. you 'll get it over with here . 
i know . 
how many times have you talked ? 
probably five or six . 
not a whole lot . 
i 've done maybe four or five . 
she just sent me the information out . 
i got a hold of it , 
i just sent it back in , 
she stuck my name on some list , 
so they mailed me the information that i filled out . 
what other topics have you had ? 
i 've talked about the weather . 
and it was hot here , 
so that was pretty interesting . 
and i talked to someone about the , education system . 
i forget exactly what the focus was on that one . 
but that was fairly interesting . 
and i talked to somebody about credit card usage . 
and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her , that she and her family just did n't have much , 
and they did n't have much credit available to them . 
and so she basically did n't use credit cards and did n't know very much about them and how they work , and how you can use them to your advantage , and how you can do certain things with them . 
i use everything with my visa , 
and i pay it all off . 
so that 's a good deal for me . 
i get free money for thirty days . 
that 's the way i use them 
i try to make sure i do n't get in debt . 
that 's always a good plan . 
i ca n't think of anything else that i 've talked about . 
most of the ones on the list , i checked off stuff like football and stuff that i would enjoy talking about 
and i have n't gotten a one of them yet when i 've called . 
let 's see , 
i 've had fishing , 
we did . 
how funny . 
so we talked about the cowboys a little bit . 
so we talked about cardinals . 
so that one was all right . 
and then what else did i have ? 
so i was caught a little off guard , 
and i could n't think of anything at all . 
so i started making stuff up . 
i told this woman that my hobby was gardening , 
my grandfather gave me a plant once , 
and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill , 
you could freeze it , 
you could dry it out , 
no matter what , you could n't kill it . 
i killed it pretty quick . 
i do n't have too much of a green thumb either . 
i do have one plant here , 
it 's been hanging out for a while , 
but i think it 's one of the easiest plants . 
i do n't know the name of it , 
i have n't . 
have you ? 
that is a wonderful movie . 
the length is n't too long ? 
. 
we all heard different opinions about it . 
you do n't even realize it . 
it was too long 
and they thought at certain points that it was going to end , 
and it did n't , 
and it kept going on 
i thought it was great . 
i 've seen some different clips of it , 
and it looks good , 
it 's just i have n't had the time to go to the movies lately . 
i ca n't remember what they said his name was . 
that 'd work for me , 
let me tell you . 
i thought that was really funny . 
i do n't know his name , 
but he played the character in it that was very dirty , 
i saw the one clip of him 
that was rather gross . 
the wagon driver . 
but other than that i 've heard the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful . 
and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably to age the material 
the styles , 
but they did n't age it quite enough it seemed . 
but it was a very good movie . 
i guess i will have to see it then . 
what have you seen lately ? 
actually have been to the movies , 
i think the last movie i saw was misery . 
i did n't see that . 
i really do n't either , 
but i went with someone , 
it 's an excellent movie . 
i was n't sure , 
because just generally that kind of scary stuff i just do n't want to have anything to do with it . 
it 's not . 
i think i heard somebody talking about that 
she cuts his foot off or something . 
in the book apparently she cuts his feet off , 
she breaks both of his ankles . 
and that i could n't watch , 
but , you could tell when it was coming . 
so 
that was so that he could n't leave her , 
it still just seems a little twisted to me . 
i 'm not sure i would have enjoyed that at all . 
you would n't like to see anything happen to anybody , 
but it was just how she got so caught up , 
her emotions 
but she was a killer , 
and the character prior to that had been someone that had killed other people 
but no one knew that . 
we just have n't had the time to go to the movies lately , 
i know , 
we do n't see movies at the movies a lot . 
and we went to see not without my daughter , 
but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape , 
and then we rent them . 
now i want to see sleeping with the enemy . 
that looks really good too . 
that looks good . 
but i 'm not sure i want to go see it yet . 
i do n't think i want to see that either . 
i know , 
i do n't think i could . 
we had some friends that went to see it 
and they said it was okay . 
i think they may be playing up some aspects of the movie that are n't the main aspects . 
i liked that movie . 
so , it seems like that kind of thriller suspense and not real strange in other ways . 
i guess that 's about it . 
it was nice . 
maybe we 'll talk to you again . 
it was nice talking to you . 
being a former drug user . i guess i have to say at this point , that i do approve of it . 
because i know that in using drugs i was not a good employee . 
whenever you are an employee of the company , you are using its assets , 
and , i work for a tire company modern tire . 
where do you work ? 
and that 's where most of our injuries occur . 
and what we do is we 'll have a drug test if a man has an accident . 
then he 's automatically given a drug test . 
do they do it within hours of the accident , 
when he goes to the doctor the first time . 
i do n't know if it 's been a deterrent or not , because we have just started using it for the past year or so . 
we 've let some people go that we , found that drugs were used in their system . 
they have n't pursued it . 
and he went to a separate drug testing firm , 
and they showed it negative . 
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried . 
i think that 's probably true , too . 
that 's sort of scary . 
and then i also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine . 
and he tested positive on cocaine . 
you always wonder , is he just saying that . 
that 's a bad situation . 
i think most companies now , as far as entry exams require that . 
i think they should . 
we have designated smoking areas . 
but it 's a little bit separated . 
we lease the building . 
and it 's a factory environment . 
and they have designated smoking , 
but it 's just wide open , 
it 's not ventilated properly 
and i think that 's bad . 
but as far as the drugs being in the factory kind of environment that way i think it 's essential . 
in fact we 've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years , 
and i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to come up , 
they never called me , 
and finally , the day we declared war was my time . 
and my boss has gone for about three times , i think . 
and i told him he 's obviously in a high risk group . 
the executives ? 
and of course they did specifically single them out when we started that they were going to do all them first . 
the executives ? 
would n't that be awful if you were using , and lose your job and everything . 
which i thought was interesting . 
i ca n't believe i was so brazen before . 
like i say , i 'm a former drug user , 
and so i do n't use drugs any more . 
what kind of drugs did you use , if you do n't mind ? 
and all on the job , too . 
it had gotten that bad . 
it 's really lucky that you got away from that . 
cause that 's really , downward spiral . 
life is so much more enjoyable . 
and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job . 
that 's it . 
there 's all kinds of drawbacks , much less the drug testing . 
just life in general . 
that 's right . 
i 'm definitely for it . 
that 's right . 
in some cases 
it was a chemical handling type . 
and they have some serious chemicals out there , 
they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water that kind of thing . 
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals . 
and that 's really frightening . 
so i think some places like that , it should be mandatory on a greater frequency than maybe , just paper pushers like i am . 
i would think there would be . 
you 'd think so 
but they were n't ? 
i do n't know if they do it till yet . 
is n't that awful . 
and at that time , they had no testing whatsoever . 
so that 's scary . 
i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time , 
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living . 
and she said , he 's the supervisor of this chemical land fill where they go and dump all this toxic stuff . 
and i just went , where ? . 
should we move ? 
let me move as far away as possible . 
that 's awful . 
but , i 'm proud , though , that , i grew up in the sixties , 
and back then it was popular , 
but people have really become wise about drugs 
and they really have a good campaign for the young people . 
they know it 's not smart , 
that 's right , 
and that 's good . 
that 's the best way to stop it . 
it really is . 
i think we did it . 
it 's good talking to you . 
do you have a favorite recipe ? 
that 's what it said to discuss some 
maybe a recipe , 
it says , what you would have for a dinner party . 
this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin . 
maybe we 're all set . 
we 'll talk for five minutes , 
it says what you would have for a dinner party , 
i 'll tell you , what i 'm going to have . if i can find it . 
that 's wonderful . 
i do n't know if it will come out . 
and then i was going to make other things like potato skins . 
that sounds good . 
you do n't necessarily have to dip this stuff . 
that 's always a good thing . 
i think they like to have healthy stuff too , 
i think better even than other kinds of food . 
i think they try and suggest it . 
it stays nice and fresh . 
that 's true . 
that is really neat . 
i like those . 
they made a couple of those , 
and i was pretty pleased . 
i never made one for myself though . 
but they look easy enough to make 
i think it would be a lot of work 
but i think they 're really neat 
and they go melt some chocolate chips , . 
is that good ? 
but i 've never tried it , 
are they really good ? 
i bet it does n't mix well , does it ? 
but they 're really reasonably priced , 
that 's good 
because i know they 've been really expensive lately . because they were n't in season , 
is that right ? 
of course , their seasons are switched . 
do you want to discuss the recipe ? 
i have a recipe if you want . 
a lot of people try to stay away from this 
is that right ? 
i 've never heard of that . 
and it 
first of all i take about a quarter and a half of milk 
and you put it on a really low heat . 
no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot . 
i do n't let that worry me . 
and i get the milk lukewarm 
and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it 
and i have this thing 
it makes a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough . 
i do n't know , 
they 're real neat . 
i think they 're real reasonably priced , 
some of them , they used to be a hundred dollars , 
and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert 
but i did n't get that one , 
but it 's real handy because it does n't have a cord 
and you beat this cornstarch right into the milk , , 
and it does an excellent job , 
or just hand beat it . 
but i do n't think it gets it good enough . 
and then before the milk gets too hot i add two beaten eggs 
and i really mix them in good . 
and then about a half a cup of sugar 
i beat it every minute for about ten seconds 
and you just keep beating it in . 
you 'd have to probably almost go out 
once it starts boiling , i cook it for a good seven to ten minutes 
and then you can make chocolate 
or you can take it off and let it cool 
you put really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter 
that is really interesting . 
it comes in a real dark can , 
our mothers used to use it . 
i have some . 
i suppose you could use that . 
cooking chocolate . 
that 's really interesting , 
i 've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before 
that 's really neat . 
i used to make the regular pudding , the chocolate and put it in the pie shell 
and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie , it would soak into the pie shell 
and it was red , 
how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own ? 
something she had collected out of woman 's day or something . 
is that right ? 
that is just really neat . 
it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good . 
the trick is to get the cornstarch , 
right in the lukewarm milk . 
sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl 
and i would put it in the sink 
and i 'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good . 
it seems to be better than putting the cornstarch into the liquid 
once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top . 
so you put the milk in the cornstarch ? 
and i 'll do this , 
i 'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg . 
my husband really likes it thick 
when you cook a package , it 's a little less , 
but i put it in a nice glass bowl 
and some people do n't like that , film on the pudding 
and i might put it back on . 
do you put it in the refrigerator then 
when it starts steaming a lot i definitely put it in the refrigerator , 
my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you 're going to make it work too hard . 
that 's true . 
i knew that . 
, that 's why i do that . 
i do n't know 
that 's my great hard recipe . 
i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music 
and none of them are recent . 
do you know who he is ? 
and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot , 
you like a variety . 
sort of easy listening because you like country 
but not all country . 
i do n't like that , when they start , 
i do n't know . 
i like some of his songs , though . 
they 're not so sad country all the time . 
they 're just kind of sweet sometimes . 
they 're not the typical country where they 're just my wife left me , my dog left me . 
my truck is broken down . 
my truck 's broken down 
and my house just burned down . 
there 's a guy , 
he plays piano . 
i think he 's dead now , 
but he plays wonderfully . 
i like that . 
do you play the piano , 
or you just like it ? 
very badly . 
i 've got a piano , 
my mother got a piano and vowed that someone in the family was going to learn , 
so we all had to take lessons , 
and i was the one that did the least poorly , 
so she gave it to me . 
and it 's sitting here mostly taking up space , 
but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it . 
it is real relaxing . 
it must be fun to be able to play it 
and not many things you can play people will sit there and sing along to 
and you ca n't sing along either 
when , i do n't play , 
i like jazz music 
so do i . 
what 's that ? 
forgot about that . 
what 's that ? 
i said so do i , 
i forgot about jazz . 
we 've got about five of those . 
i love them . 
i love those , too . 
they 're just so relaxing . 
i 'd never heard them before until i went in a music store 
and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it 
and i heard a piece 
and it was just so wonderful . 
is n't that nice . 
it 's nice when you have a piece that is so peaceful , that everybody likes , 
but , it 's mostly relaxing 
and because it does n't have words you do n't feel like , there 's anything you have to remember as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean 
you can just sit , 
you know those little booklets that come along with it 
and you can just see the things that they 're trying to show with music . 
he 's identified the people that have written certain songs , 
then he buys the pieces that have that person on it . 
i see what you 're saying . 
i do n't even know who did which ones , 
but he does . 
i ca n't identify them either . 
i just like them . 
i know which ones come next , 
but i do n't even know their names . 
most of them i do n't know their names of the song , 
but i can identify them . 
but i like that 
and course i like classical music . 
were you in the band ? 
i was in the band , 
so was i . 
and i was in chamber music groups and stuff , 
so i 'm used to pieces 
so . i can relate to it , i suppose . 
and i 'm like you 
i like the older stuff , too , 
what 's his name , 
plays the trumpet . 
did you like them ? 
i like mostly the older groups i think . 
i like simply red , 
we got simply red . 
and i like breeze , 
i like the group . 
i think just because they sound a lot like simply red . 
if i 'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays , it 's easy listening . 
what type , simply red , 
i 've never heard of that . 
is it just instrumental ? 
it 's got people singing , 
but it is instrumental . 
but it 's got people singing 
but it 's got a whole bunch of people singing . 
he ca n't hear me . 
i do n't remember how many people , 
but , it 's got men and women 
and it 's nice , 
i mean it 's pleasant music . 
it 's not where it hurts your ears to hear it . 
it does n't have all the brass and everything . 
my husband is telling me we have to hit the road . 
we 're going to go to commerce and see a friend . 
you must live in this area . 
where are you ? 
you 're going to commerce ? 
just because there 's a friend up there , 
not because there 's much else . 
they 're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas . 
for colleges ? 
and they 've been doing a lot of that in the area . 
i 'm through . 
no more for me . 
no more . 
what do you do ? 
right now i 'm just a homemaker , 
but i 'm going to school for legal assistant 
and that 's what i know , 
and , just nothing basically . 
but i 'm really interested in the legal environment , 
but i do n't want to be a lawyer 
so i said i think i 'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant . 
that 'd probably be pretty interesting . 
about four hundred showed up , 
and it was for a murder trial . 
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire . 
we stayed till about one thirty 
and they 're going to call the ones that they 're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time 
that 's how it works . 
and they say it 's going to last about two to three weeks . 
i was an investigator 
and i was tailing the woman that was killed . 
and the one that 's accused was the one that actually did it . 
and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been getting cocaine from his client and then selling it , 
and he had skipped bail 
and they finally extradited him 
and he 's going to testify for the state against her so he 'll have his sentence reduced . 
and this is the man that was in front of you ? 
they 'll , weed him out . 
the investigator . 
he got off right away . 
and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he 'd told me that , 
so i figure that that will make me biased 
and i wo n't be chosen . 
not necessarily 
hopefully . 
but there 's probably something else that might make you . 
because you could know about the crime , but not necessarily be taken off the jury not be accepted for the jury . 
pretty much a lot of people would know about it and know some of the different things about it 
but they might weed you out some other way . 
if you do n't believe in death penalty , you 're not going to be picked at all . 
the death penalty . . 
i said that , i could believe in it in certain instances , but i 'd find it hard to levy that against somebody . 
you 're not going to want to have him have that punishment . 
i was picked for another murder trial before 
and it 's so hard because everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done , 
and if you 're trying to hold out there 's so much pressure on you 
and you 've got to come up with a decision . 
especially with something where you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt . 
you have to find whether they 're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
books . 
mainly i read the bible these days . 
that 's very good . 
i do , too . 
that 's great to hear . 
i used to read a lot of novels , 
but it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the bible and you work and whatever that pretty well takes up your time for reading . 
it does . 
and he really has . 
it 's getting , to where a just really want to read it . 
that 's good . 
that 's good . 
it 's hard for me to find time , also , to read . 
a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that because i do n't have a lot of time , 
but when i do get to sit down and read , i like to read the bible 
and i like to read , 
i read to my daughter a lot , too . 
do you ? 
so i like reading those to her 
and she really enjoys those . 
so that 's good . 
and it 's kind of short because we do n't have a lot of time , to read , 
so , it 's real enjoyable . for both of us . 
i guess i have n't . 
this present darkness and i forget the other , 
how old is your daughter . 
five . 
five , 
he 's written some children 's books as well 
and they 're all spiritually oriented , 
what 's his name again ? 
i have to look for those . 
do 
because i love to read his , children 's books , 
just to read them . 
that 's good . 
they 're good , 
they 're great . 
that 's good . 
that sounds pretty neat . 
it is . 
it 's real exciting . 
i 'll have to look for those . 
that 's neat . 
my daughter has precious moments collection 
and i like that because it 's real easy to follow for her , 
if i read straight out of the bible to her she 'd never understand any of it . 
it 's hard for me . 
that 's right . 
it is real hard to follow and understand , 
and it helps explain who people are . 
that 's about the hardest thing is , who 's related to who . 
i know it , 
it sure is , 
but it is good reading 
and it 's good for us , and everything . 
that 's right . 
i really do enjoy it . 
i 've read a lot of his , too . 
and i like that , 
that 's good fun reading . 
ca n't put them down . 
you ca n't , 
you really ca n't . 
they are good 
i really do enjoy his . 
there 's another guy . 
what is his name . 
i know . 
who ? 
i know her . 
it 's a guy . 
and he writes the same thing , though . 
it 's that real , gruesome , horror stories . 
that 's good . 
his last name ends in a z , 
i know that . 
i think i know who you 're talking about . 
i 'm in a book club 
and i think i 've seen his books in there . 
i 've never read any of his . 
it 's one of his first books , the stand . 
that long thing . 
i know it . 
and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that . 
they do kind of follow or , are similar . 
i love that book , though . 
i thought it was great . 
it really was , 
and i loved the shining . 
that was my favorite . 
whenever they made that into a movie , i was thinking if they show that , i 'll just die . 
for some reason that scared me more than anything . 
he just brings stuff alive . 
you could just visualize everything . 
and that was a pretty scary movie , too . 
i think they did a pretty good job , 
but , they did n't follow it exactly , 
but they did do it justice . 
that 's right . 
but most of the time they do n't follow books very well when they make them into movies . 
that 's true . 
i liked it as well . 
that 's , another big fat one . 
i did , too . 
that was good . 
did you read that one ? 
except it broke my heart . 
i 'm a dog lover . 
me , too . 
and then night stand , 
is that night , 
dead zone . 
that 's one i liked . 
what ? 
dead zone . 
i 've read that one , too . 
that was a real good one . 
he 's written a lot of books . 
he just sits down eight hours a day . just like any other job . 
i know it . 
and then he has some under another name . that he 's written . 
that 's right . 
he is really interesting . 
he 's so prolific . 
i wish i could do that . 
i know it . 
and i have gone back 
i do , too . 
once you can get into the language , 
so it 's kind of hard to keep at it , 
that 's true , 
they 're worthwhile . 
literature ? 
that was one of my favorite subjects in school was literature . 
me , too . 
i used to love those good old books . 
i did n't mind doing that at all . 
why ca n't i think of their names , 
that was another one . 
you know who i 'm talking about . 
those are good old books and classics , 
that 's right . 
sure is neat . 
a lot of people just do n't have time to read nowadays . 
i know it 's really hard for me . 
do you ? 
so it 's hard for me to sit down and read , 
i can imagine . 
but when i do i just love it . 
me , too . 
i think we 've accomplished five minutes 
i think we have , too . 
thank you very much . 
it 's good talking to you . 
you , too . 
are you on a regular exercise program right now ? 
and i hate it . 
how about you ? 
i 'm kind of off and on . 
off and on 
i guess i 've been kind of off and on 
right now i 'm kind of off . 
i 'd say more on than off . 
what type of exercise do you do ? 
and then i do low impact aerobics . 
i guess you do n't enjoy that very much . 
not really . 
do you find that to be boring ? 
and time consuming , 
it 's not just the exercise that 's boring and time consuming , 
it 's afterwards , 
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up . 
is this something that you go through every year . 
i have n't decided whether i want to play yet or not 
it 's one of those universal type exercise machines . 
but i have n't really sat down and used it match yet , 
so it 's collecting dust right now . 
a lot of things do that . 
i had an exercise bike 
i use to have one , 
and i finally got rid of sit cause i never used it , 
that 's good . 
when i go visit them i get on that thing every now and then . 
it 's nice because when the weather 's bad you do n't have any excuse . 
i just got the bicycle out today , 
and it was real nice outside , 
had to get out to do something . 
i ca n't ride a bike 
i 've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold 
it 's too nice , 
it 's been too nice all weekend . 
but 
i need to start something again . 
i 've always , 
but it 's terribly boring , 
and so i really do n't ever keep a program up consistently . 
have you ever had any injuries from jogging ? 
i never have . 
i do n't job enough to develop any injuries 
i usually only go about a mile or two . 
that 's not quite , so easy . 
you have to have the right , type of shoes too , 
that 's , very important . 
i found that , true especially from walking on toe and fronts . 
i do n't have to buy jogging shoes all to often 
my do n't get very much use . 
i guess my breakdown about every six months . 
i usually enjoy the exercise i do 
but like i said i 'm just not very consistent about maintaining a program . 
so i 'll bicycle 
i get into that for a little while and maybe go out on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile , 
but then i 'll get tired of doing that , and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week . 
but that gets old too in a very short order , 
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis . 
do n't let it collect dust . 
at least exercise while dusting it off . 
that 'll be good . 
i 've always found that when you write things down and set goals it 's a lot easier to keep something going . 
when i was in high school we had a choice of taking physical education courses on exercise , 
an one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine , lifting weights and working out like that . 
and that was very helpful 
we kept charts of our progress , and consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks . 
i found that to be very helpful . 
are you going to do that ? 
i need to , 
i have n't started yet 
but it 's a thought . 
that sounds like something good to do then . 
sounds like something i should do . 
nice way to start off this spring . 
get back in shape . 
how often do you go out each week on your walking ? 
i switch every other day 
one day i walk 
and one day i do the aerobics . 
about how far do you go walking ? 
i 'm trying to get my tolerance now 
i just had surgery less then two months ago , 
and right now i 'm just a little over about a mile and a half , 
that 's good . 
they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging . 
it 's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect . 
so i 'm upset , 
but it 's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is . 
it is 
and you can get a really good workout on it . 
do you go to an aerobics class 
i have a cassette . 
i use tapes . 
and they have a couple of shows called basic training , 
and what is the other one called . 
i do n't know if he 's still on any more or not , 
i use to watch one on the air , 
bodies in motion that 's the name of the one i was thinking of . 
i watched that cause he was cute . 
he 's not bad 
his assistants usually are n't either . 
on the beach . 
they do low i pact stuff now , 
do they . 
they 're on every day . 
he 's still doing it then . 
every morning . 
i 'll have to tune in . 
at what time , 
i ca n't remember what time . 
i 'll have to check it back up , 
but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show , at least on . 
every now and then . 
not everybody has a picture perfect body . 
i actually taped a few session that they had on there 
but i have n't done so much as watch the tape that i made . 
that 's a thought . 
so i 'm kind of bad about that myself . 
that 's thought , 
i have n't thought about that , 
they 're going to beep us pretty soon . 
i sure enjoyed . 
nice talking to you too . 
talk to you later . 
capital punishment , 
i honestly do n't feel like it 's strict enough in my opinion . 
in the way that it 's applied or it 's applied at all ? 
applied at all . 
how do you feel that it should be applied ? 
you know ? 
and that , the penalty ought to be out there , and be enforced ? 
if you 're going to sentence somebody twenty years , let them stay twenty years . 
i agree with that completely . 
i know we do n't have enough prisons , 
but there has got to be some kind of punishment , for these people . 
that 's right . 
because if they turn around , they get away with it , 
and they get away with it , 
and they get away with it , 
and then they do something worse 
and they get a slap on the wrist . 
they get , thirty days in jail 
and they go through fourteen appeals , and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars . 
that 's right . 
that 's , honestly right . 
they have really got it better than we do , in a lot of ways . 
you know ? 
they certainly are living at our expense . 
it seems like , really a rough time 
you know ? 
i 'm not saying innocent person , 
let 's say someone wrote a hot check , for instance . 
when they go to prison , it , really seem like it 's a rough time for them 
and a murderer well go to prison , 
he 's just there to serve his time , and get back out on the street . 
that 's what people face with that choice . 
that should be life , 
and less they 're out . 
if they 're even in that long . 
or they appeal , 
and then they get an appeal that says it was an unjust amount of time , an extraordinary long length , or something . 
time , 
i 'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent , 
it 's not a deterrent right now , because it 's not really effective . 
there should be for this crime , this is the penalty . 
you killed , someone in cold blood or whatever . 
you get , it back , 
this is what 's going to happen . 
and it sounds horrible . 
i hear myself saying this , 
i know . 
because they let them back out again , 
and they do the same thing over , and over , again , 
same thing , 
then they put them back in jail , 
and they get out , 
and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed 
and it 's like i said at our expense . 
a lot of people really does n't think that much about it , because it has n't happened to them , which it has n't to me either , 
you know ? 
but still , it could . 
i know , 
you read about it in the paper , every day , somebody who 's done this , or that , something really horrible 
and they just get away with it , 
and nothing happens . 
and as far as the other states , i honestly do n't know what their capital punishment is . 
i , have n't kept up anything , like that . 
and then they took it off the books , 
they repealed it 
but still , it came up though , did n't it , 
the jury that sentenced him , sentenced him to death 
and then they reinstated it later , 
but the penalty did n't go back . 
you know ? 
it seems like a lot of times the law is totally on the criminal side , and is n't protecting the rest of the people . 
the victim is really left out in the cold , more or less , does n't it , 
especially in things , you pick up the paper , and you read you think , 
and then he gets up for this one trial , 
and they do n't finds anything out about the facts that he 's done this over and over and over again 
i do n't know if they say it 's the first time offense or whatever , 
and a lots of things . 
but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too . 
and then three years later they 're cured , and let loose on society again . 
it just does n't make sense , 
it 's a scary world out there anymore , where you 're afraid to go out , 
and it was n't that way when i was younger . 
like i , said , i live in a small place . 
we could go around , 
but even the small towns now though , has really changed from when i was a kid , 
but now i 'm raising children . 
ever , 
when i was a kid , i would run between my neighbors , three and four blocks sometimes , 
and now i do n't let my kids out of the front yard , that i ca n't see them . 
see them . 
we 're probably fixing to run out of time pretty , soon , 
but i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
good talking to you too . 
what do you do this weekend ? 
pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard . 
what do you have planned for your yard ? 
but they 've gone a few years of neglect . 
so , we 're in the process of revitalizing the whole situation . 
we 've got different flower beds in front and a built in window box , , 
trying to get some color back in those , get the trees trimmed up get rid of a few weed problems and things like that . 
what part of the state do you live in ? 
we 're planning on moving to flower mound , 
we 're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there . 
seems like it . 
the place we 've been living at we 're just leasing it . 
i 'll bet . 
i 'll bet . 
just scratching two or three inches was just a chore . 
it was , 
it was 
and then when it gets wet you do n't even want to get out in the yard , 
it 's horrible . 
it 's a nightmare . 
actually it 's done , 
i know right where that 's at . 
we 've got maybe eight inches to a foot of soil , 
and then it 's solid rock from then on down , 
it 's a little aggravating , , 
we ca n't put in anything too big as far as shrubs and things like that because they 've got to get a chance to find the cracks in the rock . 
it is . 
how do you put trees in there ? 
we 're just happy that there 's trees already there so far , 
anything like that is a major undertaking i guess , 
sprinkler systems or anything start to get real expensive because there 's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock . 
and it , not even , considering a pool or anything like that , 
practically has to be blasted in i guess . 
and it makes for a different challenge , 
but i keep hearing all the stories of different parts of town . 
and the first thing the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in because he said i 've got a dozen different varieties 
and each one works in one part of town 
and that 's it , 
that 's basically what he was trying to tell us . 
we tried planting tomatoes last year 
and they turned out pretty poor . 
i just wish i 'd known , the variety and everything . 
but it 's amazing we also have roses , 
in fact , we put in some more roses yesterday . 
what type roses ? 
a few different , hybrid tea type varieties . 
we have a few of the real short stem . 
but i do n't know 
but i 'm amazed because the sun is so intense , 
and the roses just seem to survive just fine there . 
that 's what we 're searching , 
we 've got all the different lake editions around the house 
and we 're kind of experimenting right now . 
we 've got the direct sun in front 
so the backyard is just complete dark all day long . 
and , we 're struggling to find something for those areas . 
have you , done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not ? 
they 're in pretty good condition . 
we 've been pretty lucky on that . 
just if you want a lot of light for underneath , that may be all right because , we have some old fruit trees . 
so we may just be getting rid of that 
but our peaches they seem to be doing just fine , 
but they really need pruning . 
it just seems that even pruning once a year is really not enough 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
i do n't know . 
but , what kind of grass are you growing ? 
but it looks like it would hold the soil 
but it really does n't . 
but . 
there 's such a difference , through the year . 
it 's already been built and everything . 
they 've been living there for about three months now , 
but the wind there , has been so bad that they 've tried to plant grass 
and they just , , have some big time problems 
that 's it . 
so they just watching their lawn just blow away . 
but it 's quite an undertaking . 
they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property , on the side of a hill . 
it 's beautiful , 
you can see the house from miles away , 
but it 's a pretty neat little job 
but , they save a lot of energy 
but just for them they 're going to have to start gardening . 
it 's going to be from the ground up . 
the whole way . 
and they said , we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just , , getting this property developed . 
it 's amazing , 
and i do n't know , what they have , 
they have all the water they want , 
actually , they can pump water , 
they have to get permission 
but they can pump water up from the shore , 
they have to pay some kind of fee per year . 
but right now though i think they 're trying to get the trees planted and everything . 
but i just think of all of the money that they 're going to have to spend just getting that . 
and some places , they really nail them for tax . 
and you 're talking just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes . 
it 's ridiculous . 
that really is , 
but the water usage they try to limit , even though there 's three or four streams that flow into it , 
they still have n't gotten used to the dry land farming 
but i do n't know 
i just came back from there 
and just the air is so dry . 
i do n't see how anything can survive out there , for long periods of time . 
they 're smart , 
they 're about the smartest tree around . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
they say the roots have developed 
so that 's all they work on . 
they do n't do anything . 
and we 're trying to decide what to put on one side of the house and things like that , 
but there 's so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks 
it 's kind of disappointing . 
i do n't know 
but during the fall , when the rain let off just a little bit it just dried up . 
i do n't happen to have one at home . 
but i do have a personal computer on my desk here . 
a type of work station ? 
and it works just fine . 
no big deal , 
it does the things i need for it to do . 
it 's not even that . 
i think that 's about where it is . 
word processing obviously . 
i do that , 
i use them both here at work and at home . 
i bet that 's a pretty nice setup . 
it is . 
unfortunately i need all of it . 
and i 'm really pleased with it . 
it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and database searches . 
what i 've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them . 
have you , 
to try to make them more effective and useful . 
have you been struggling along those lines ? 
i seem to always be in the next to the last generation of word processing software . 
so , i can never quite stay current with that . 
i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it . 
i used it on some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it . 
i can believe that . 
very frustrating . 
but again i 've been dealing with large files both data and otherwise . 
you come here with the b level of specs ? 
not really . 
i 'm not that up on that sort of thing . 
it 's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you 're trying to build . to one level down from assistant description . 
it sounds like you 're pretty much into computers . 
i sure need them . 
there 's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to try to do my job without them . 
i can believe that . 
it 's been interesting . 
maybe you 'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things . 
i think that 's when you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have . when you start seeing what all they can do for you . 
of course , needs and wants are n't necessarily the same thing . 
i understand that . 
that must be a fairly recent release . 
that came out around the first of the year . 
it does a few more things than had been available before . 
but i 'm not sure that it 's such a massive improvement . , 
i enjoyed our discussion . 
i did too , 
and you have a good day . 
you do the same . 
where do you live ? 
i used to . 
i lived there for a long time . 
that 's great . 
so , we have many recycling activities 
and i 'm , in full support of all of them . 
we are too . 
our community is just starting to get organized about it . 
they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our things and dump them off ourselves . 
that 's something 
but it seems to me that we 've gotten a whole lot better cooperation out here by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra , 
actually i do n't think we pay very much extra at all too , 
but the garbage men , come by on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb . 
i think that 's great . 
and they give us one for aluminum and steel , one for metals , and one for glass , 
and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags . 
that 's great . 
and , it really pays for itself because then the city , gets the money from the recycling . 
we 're all for it . 
one 's for white paper 
and one 's for colored paper 
but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines , 
and there 's no way to get rid of them . 
it just seems like such a waste . 
it does . 
it does . 
i 've seen talk about using garbage for energy . 
and so you could also apply the magazines toward that . 
that would be a help . 
i wish they would do that here . 
we have got so little landfill space left that we 're going to run out before the end of this decade . 
and it 's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things . 
i know it . 
we did have another novel experiment start this year . 
now we can put all our yard clippings out . 
you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags , 
you usually buy them by the dozen . 
that 's great . 
that 's a great idea . 
i wish that our city was that involved in recycling , like that 
because i 've talked to many people 
and we would n't mind going its extra effort to do it . 
if they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience , i think most people would . 
, 
and i do n't mind , 
at first it was the little extra money that you got returning the cans in and stuff like that . 
but now i do n't mind as long as things are getting recycled that we do n't get reimbursed . 
i think it 's , to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up , then to get that two cents when you take it to the store . 
i know it . 
but so few people have enough to make that worthwhile 
you 'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back . 
plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also . 
i know the one that we use has recycling for the bags . 
that 's great . 
they just take it off like they do a coupon . 
they can just subtract it from your bill , 
and they say , as long as it 's clean 
here they do n't want your rotted tomatoes . 
but they want any clean and dry plastic bag 
and there , right outside that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers , 
and now we 've got the bag for the plastic bags . 
i understand , 
my husband about once a weekend he 'll go to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out . 
and he 'll go pick them up because he just ca n't stand that . 
how nice , 
that 's great . 
and otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse . 
but otherwise they have to be in one of their paper bags . 
that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there . 
that 's not going to be a regular feature . 
those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills . 
and they stay forever . 
and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines . 
i do too . 
the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile . 
they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff . 
and you 're not going to bother if you have one bag full , to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts . 
and the only difficulty with that is that we 're in the middle of a five-year drought 
but at the moment we 're using the china cups , 
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year , 
and then you 're supposed to keep it recycled every day . 
that 's good . 
they should last awhile . 
i believe we are . 
i have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening . 
and so it will be good , in the long run . 
it sure will . 
i enjoyed it . 
good to talk , 
what is your view , 
do you consider the soviet union a threat ? 
it 's real confusing right now to know what kind of a threat it is , i guess , 
it takes awhile to get used to something , if the , place has completely turned that much around to where they 're not what they used to be , 
it 's hard to know anymore if it 's a threat one way or another because it used to be so , much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell rank and file in behind it . 
you never know , 
whereas in the past it was seen as whoever was the head of the communist party was seen as untouchable . 
the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so dramatic that you almost think , wait a minute , 
we 're getting stuck into something here , 
if somebody 's about to clobber you , the first thing they do is sort of say , we 're ashamed , we 're not going to do that anymore . 
and i 'd like to think that that is n't true 
it 's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible , , 
if i 'd have been asleep for five years , and read it in a book , i said , that could n't have happened that way . 
it 's amazing just because of the drain that 's been on both economies that our economy is , of course , been able to withstand that a little better , 
i do n't know what the percentages are , 
but i heard it one time , 
and finally who knows 
but it 's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period . 
even if it is the best thing in the long run , it just steps on too many people 's toes , who are comfortable with the way the situation is . 
i guess to answer the question directly , i 'm still just a little bit leery of the whole thing . 
what i have n't seen is a great stepping back in the military , situation . 
it 's one thing to let us go ahead and sort of disarm 
of course , it did n't turn out that way . 
and that may have been a kind of far out way of thinking about it 
i do n't know . 
it 's interesting , anymore 
but , of course , the people who have challenged that or tried to do , have not been world powers . 
get back , 
or we 're going to force you . 
or we can do something about it . 
and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the red square or wherever said , okay , 
and that 's enough . 
and the tanks came in and pretty much took care of that . 
and i think he 's actually , honestly trying to do some change . 
but i do n't believe that he , in this first pass around being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either . 
this would be like if somebody was elected president of the united states and suddenly took off toward just some pretty hard socialism , 
will there be a union or not ? 
it 's not the same sort of a thing at all because that , the whole soviet system was put together under total force , , 
as we are seeing now with a lot of those , areas wanting out of it , 
those people did n't vote to become part of the soviet union , 
they had no choice . 
that was always kind of interesting , 
a lot of my friends have taken us down , the stance of these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away 
i realize that the origins are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with , and that they may have been forced , 
i 'm not that familiar with their future , 
it 's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than a volunteer or willingness to join . 
the whole thing was put together by force . 
there 's no real question about that . 
and it 's not that they came in , 
and then , just never given back . 
so . that 's , a little different situation . 
and maybe countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer is n't going to help you , 
and they 're going to land in other places , 
that 's going to be the safest place to be . 
that 's probably very true . 
that 's very interesting , 
never thought of that . 
i really do n't know , , 
i hope that what 's happening is exactly the way it appears . 
it 's kind of a strange thing we 've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say , wait a minute , 
nobody knows what to do . 
what 's really happening here . 
is it real ? 
who , was it 
and these were all the soviet economists , , 
they had some real fancy names for them . 
as a vote . 
they backed down on that . 
died down on that . 
but it 's merely an economic now . 
, what do you get shot by 
something that 's called an economic force or what is called a military pact , 
you can change the name of something 
but i wonder if it still , exists . 
the funny thing there is they 're not particularly welcome back home because they 're having housing shortages now . 
and now all of a sudden they 're going home 
that 's what they 're saying 
what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there ? 
the question was what kind of books do you read for entertainment i guess , 
i just read for escape . 
with two little kids i can understand that . 
that 's simple . 
i read to escape , 
and i do n't read any parents magazines either . 
i just finished one last night . 
a great book . 
it 's very , a typical for my reading though 
strange book . 
by somebody who was there 
a guy who was there as a foot soldier . 
i can imagine . 
what 's the latest one you 've read ? 
i tell you what , 
i 'm trying to think back now , 
i read an awful lot of periodicals and almost what you call reference books . 
i 've had similar problems . 
as a matter of fact , 
because i finished one , 
i think this is two years ago , 
and the novel did n't do that much for me . 
but the period of time was fascinating . 
was it battle cry of freedom , 
i think it was battle cry of freedom . 
battle cry of freedom . 
and it 's not a story of the civil war , 
it 's a story of all the politics and lobbying and just basically state by state events , that lead to the events that brought about the civil war . 
there was a lot more to it than that , were n't there ? 
there was a lot more to it than that . 
it was a political move . 
you know what else really surprised me 
and i 'm not . 
i 've got the same problem . 
i 'm glad you put it that way . 
and all this civil war pride . 
is n't much there , was there ? 
they might as well have not even been there . 
they were n't a state 
and the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to who 's going to be going there . 
and i keep telling my husband that , 
and he keeps saying , . 
i thought , okay . 
and they had an interesting time there . 
i 'll bet they did . 
i ca n't think of the guy 's name 
you know , why they actually held them off ? 
that , could be it . 
you did n't hear me say that . 
and they did n't get across the river there 
and that was actually after the war was over 
they fought and won the whole thing . 
that 's a beautiful state . 
that 's a beautiful state . 
and besides if corn did n't grow there , it did n't matter . 
so what does that make me , 
then , she 's going to come out well rounded . 
but outside of those kind of things the other thing that i 've really gotten into reading is science fiction . 
i 've always kind of enjoyed it . 
i used to read a lot more than i do now . 
i 've gone to the point where my husband travels , i get out two or three books . 
i think i 've read all four of them 
and i understand that there 's a fifth . 
in the last six weeks he 's been on the road a lot . 
space that was the one i was trying to wade through was space , 
did n't get very far on that . 
and even then i was so disgusted with it 
whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller . 
and i got about a hundred pages through it and realized i had a thousand more , 
i thought , i ca n't do this . 
the books are kind of imposing to say the least . 
let 's see , 
not too many people have read that one i do n't think . 
is that a big , thick book ? 
what the hell for ? 
because that 's where my folks all came from . 
and they had a centennial here awhile back . 
i read the grant takes command , 
that was pretty good . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know if i 'd call it science fiction or fantasy . 
sometimes it 's awful hard , 
some of those get very philosophical 
they can be in any setting , 
they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting , 
i loved that novel . 
and i had a hole in my roof 
and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse , 
and i was reading dune . which seeming rather ironic . 
you 're reading dune . 
and , i think that 's probably my favorite of any piece of science fiction that i 've ever read . 
that was a movie too , was n't it ? 
and the movie was awful . 
was it ? 
it was just terrible . 
i did n't see it 
i do n't know , 
even having read the book watching that movie , i could n't figure out , what they were talking about , at all . 
i was real disappointed in that . 
i 'll tell you another good book , 
do you like scary things ? 
some history , books are pretty scary , 
that 's true . 
somebody who , saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they 'd ever seen , 
they did n't sleep all night . 
i am debating whether or not i want to go see the movie after having read the book . 
the book is chilling . 
just chilling . 
then i wo n't tell you . 
that 's the one . 
that 's the one . 
because the character that is so horrible is another human being . 
and you 're just drawn into his horror , of him that you , begin to kind of like him . 
this guy 's smart 
the worst kind , 
how do you feel about the immigration laws ? 
currently , i think they are a little restrictive . particularly for certain ethnic groups from certain countries . 
i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last several years . 
but , of course , that 's just my opinion . 
i 'm not real sure why i got this topic , because i do n't think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws . 
i do not quite go along with that , 
that does n't make a whole . 
again , kind of having within this century , come from an immigrant family , or immigrant families on both sides . 
both my mother 's parents and my father 's parents were immigrants 
so , i 'm a little touchy every now and then about that . 
so , i do n't have any , relatives several generations back , that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family . 
they were all born here 
so i do n't have any real strong ties with the immigration laws . 
i do n't have any personal feelings about them 
and i have n't taken the time or effort to learn what they are . 
i think in a way , though i also have an opposite point of view , which is although i believe we should permit constant immigration into this country primarily for economic reasons , i think we should have some quotas , 
my grandparents came over during the time when there were quotas . 
i agree with that , 
i think they 'd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime . 
there 's another aspect of this , too . 
i was not aware of that . 
age is one , for example , 
but i think we should be a little more circumspect about it . 
again , my opinion . 
think we 've talked long enough ? 
i think so . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
i have talked long enough . 
thank you . 
let 's see . 
i guess , if i call i 'm supposed to start . 
i think that 's the way everybody has done it so far . 
but , anyway i think that we are paying a lot in taxes , 
but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms , and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money . 
we 're probably one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have . 
as far as the quality of the streets , the school systems the hospital stuff that the government gives money to . all the things that the government does like that . i think they need to manage it a little bit better , 
but i do n't think anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they 've been messing it up for many years , now . 
i have to agree . 
and you 're right . 
we do have a good government . 
we do have a lot of things that , the taxes are there to support , 
and i think that sometimes it 's to easy of an answer . 
it seems to say , i 'll tax them if you ca n't get enough money , instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or , get all of the waste out of the spending . 
but it seems like we pay the state , 
there 's the taxes set by the state 
and the city can add theirs , 
and the county adds theirs , 
and we 're paying almost eight percent sales tax , right now . which seems to me nuts . 
and when i left there , we paid six cents on the dollar , 
and that was one of the highest in the nation . 
i think it 's seven here . 
seven point something . 
ourselves is seven point seven five . 
whole state . 
it drives me crazy . 
i 'm thinking everybody is sitting here screaming about , we do n't want a state income tax , 
but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up 
and they do n't do anything about it . 
where are you at ? 
what state ? 
we 're still one of few that do n't have the state tax . 
that 's true . 
but 
the sales tax , is just getting outrageous to pay . 
that 's true . 
where do you come from originally 
i do . 
. it 's an urban area , i guess 
whatever . 
i do n't know . 
i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there . 
i 've just lived here , 
but , i do n't know , 
i do , 
that 's right . 
and i thought of those two things when i was holding for a long time . 
were you really , trying to find someone at home ? 
and so that 's what they were trying to do with the tax situation . 
i do n't think they really cared about the answer , 
they just wanted to try and catch him in something . 
but i believe in paying taxes 
and 
like everybody else , i try to take as many deductions as i can , 
i do n't want to pay more than i have to , 
and i get outraged when i feel like they go up for useless reasons , 
but i believe that they 're necessary . 
i really do , 
do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work 
not really . 
i spends a lot of time with our income tax , though . especially , this year and last year . 
i have been married for just a few years , 
schedule a . 
all the deductions and all that . 
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act , it seemed like it made everything harder ? 
it really did . 
i saw , that , too . 
i did n't notice anything simplified about it , except that they took away the deductions , the interest and , other things . 
we 're looking at buying a house , 
and that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house . 
and it will help tremendously . 
we bought ours five years ago 
and it 's the one thing , 
it seems like you make those payments every month 
and at the end of the year you 've paid all interest and no principles . 
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back . 
i 've been trying to learn as much as i can about it , 
i know i get paid twice a month , every two weeks , 
that 's once a month . 
that 's right . 
so if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks , instead of once a month , you 'll come out paying one month extra every year . 
that 's right . 
and if , it will take seven or plus years off of your note . 
that 's right . 
and they did that . 
and that 's exactly right . 
though the note is thirty years , she said it 's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years , or something like that . 
just because of exactly what you said , 
you 're making one more month 's payment every year . 
and that 's going on the principle , 
it does n't pay any interest , 
or , usually it does n't . 
so , that 's a good way to do it . 
it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner . 
we 're not going to go longer than twenty . 
but , we 're taking our time . 
that 's good , though . 
we just started two or three weeks ago . 
and we 're not going to just kill ourselves 
just two or three houses a week at the most . 
that 's good , though . 
is it kind of a buyer 's market down there ? 
that 's good . 
credit union has nine percent interest . 
that 's pretty excellent . 
i do n't know , 
we could n't think of a better time to buy than now . 
that 's good . 
but , anyway . i ca n't think of a whole lot more to say . 
i ca n't either . 
i appreciate the call , though . 
me , too . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
same here . 
she was there for two or three years before we got married . 
i guess , before i even met her . 
just a second . 
go ahead . 
but anyway , 
so she was at school out here ? 
she went to school there . 
what was her name ? 
good luck in your house hunting . 
thanks a lot . 
i do . 
you do . 
i 'm in human resources . 
that 's interesting . 
i work in the waiver . 
do you really , 
i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years . 
and then i have been in human resources for the last two years 
and i work with those same people all those nine years , 
so , i feel kind of part of the staff . 
i 'm turning in a capital request right now , 
you are . 
that 's funny that 's where you 're from . 
what are ? 
i 'm sort of an acting process engineer . 
not officially , 
but that 's pretty much what i do . 
that 's what you do , 
good deal . 
i like him , 
he 's hard , 
but we needed that . 
that 's good . 
it was the same kind of thing , 
he had a lot of good results . 
that 's what he said here . 
he 's gotten us into a linear flow that we 've never been in before . 
that 's been a real big plus . 
he 's broadened the devices that we 're making , too , which has made us as lot more stable . 
that 's good . 
anyway it was nice to talk to you . 
you too , 
i can tell . 
i know they will , 
and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed . 
me , too . 
have a good day . 
you , too . 
or are you familiar with any of that ? 
i know that we have some relatives that live around the area in there , 
and there was nowhere else to take them 
and they said they moved it just behind . 
that 's really nice to know , because we were doing the same thing . 
and we started taking them up there . 
and then , all the sudden , it disappeared . 
i did n't know . 
and we 're going , there goes our recycling place . 
that 's really nice to find out that it 's behind there . 
i could n't even think of what you call them . 
aluminum cans ? 
that 's about what we do too . 
and really , that 's really about it . 
is there any place else that really takes anything other than that , that you know of ? 
we just do n't have the room to store all that much , 
i know . 
i do n't want to be running down there every week , or whatever . 
i know . 
i know . 
we 're kind of the same way . 
and i 'm wondering are we really going to do this , 
but you kind of get into a little routine where it is automatic , now , to throw , different things in different places , 
so i just go , 
we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen 
and i 've just got three trash cans sitting in there , , 
we just kind of dump things in each one , if we get them , 
they do , too . 
and they 're impossible to crush . 
you ca n't get the down to any size . 
so , 
i guess we kind of started recycling after i moved here about a year and a half ago . 
we were using baby food 
and there was so many baby food jars . 
some of our neighbors were doing it 
and so when i found out some places to take it , 
and they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there , 
that will be good . 
so if i 'm not going to get the money for aluminum , i would just assume give it to the city of flower mound . to do something with . 
let somebody get something out of it . 
that 's true . 
and they wo n't raise our taxes . 
i do n't . 
and we 're recycling aluminum cans up here just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here 
everything is made from that . 
they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it that was going to use it for good , 
sounds like you have a little one just like i do . 
it was good to talk to you . 
it was nice to talk to you . 
they pick up newspapers , i think . 
do they really . 
it would make it a lot easier on all of us . 
talk to you later . 
ladies , first . 
and a lot of time , i find it during the day when i 'm rocking my little girl to sleep , 
so you 're a homemaker ? 
i guess , that 's , the right term nowadays . 
i guess so . 
i am . 
i stay home with two kids . 
we have a new one in the house 
and she stays home , too , also . 
i guess , i have a wide variety . 
not so much the things that are n't , 
you sound like my husband . 
there you go . 
the good ones . 
but i do n't know , 
i have seen it a couple of times 
i like the show . 
i just do n't watch it . because of the timing , 
but , i think there 's enough out there to pick from . 
and i do n't want them watching something that i do n't think they should watch 
or , i used to be really hooked on all my children , 
me . 
and then i 'd eat 
and then as my kids got older and started recognizing what was going on , i thought , this is n't really very good . 
so i gave it up . 
i had watched it since it started . 
now i do n't know who the characters are , 
and i 'll turn it on every once in awhile 
and i do n't recognize anybody , 
so i guess that 's a good sign . 
this might date me here , 
i can remember staying home , when i was five and six , and my mother watching the edge of night . 
you 're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm , and the edge of night . 
secret storm . 
i think they were back to back , and black and white . 
and i was . 
my mother watched all that stuff , too . 
and i think as the world turns may , still . 
still be on . 
it was not too long ago . 
now they got a lot of other crap involved . 
you 're right . 
i think some of the tones of the daily prime time is questionable , 
i have to agree with you . 
keep them on the channel twenty one . the nature stuff . 
we do , 
and it 's real interesting , too , the difference in my kids , 
my younger one does n't . 
we watch a lot of movies that we 've got on tapes , and stuff . 
but , we do a lot of kid watching . 
sounds like you got your hands full there , 
and i do appreciate speaking with you . 
it was fun . 
have you gotten your catalog yet ? 
i do n't think so . 
i just got my in the mail 
and it inspired me to make more phone calls . 
i 've had a few people call me , 
but , i 've never made one . 
i need to get brave . 
give them your pen number . 
that 's what i need to do . 
have a good day . 
i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows 
and the other one is night court . 
and i think they 're real different 
i do n't think they have anything in common , 
but mostly it 's kind of science fiction , 
and it 's adventure and things like that 
and then night court is just pure weird fun , 
it 's nothing serious about it at all . 
so , i do n't know why the two of them happen , to be my two favorite shows , 
but that 's the way it is , 
it 's funny that those are my husband 's two favorite shows , too , 
and i enjoy watching both of them , 
but i used to did n't like night court 
and the only reason i think i like it now is because i 've seen it so much 
and i 'm involved with the characters , 
he is . 
and i told my husband , that 's the whole point , 
that 's right , 
i find him degrading at times . 
i guess that is the point , 
they really have changed him though . 
if you 've watched it this season he still is in his own way degrading and everything , 
but he 's involved in that charity , 
in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some beautiful woman just because his mind was on the ozone layer and global warming and all this other kind of stuff . 
so that was part of his character building or whatever , 
i think it probably adds a little bit of depth to his character . 
which of course he needed . 
i think so , 
even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see a real person in those situations . 
he 's doing amazing things 
but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do 
that 's a good point , 
i like that . 
what do you consider your favorite shows ? 
i think my favorite show is hunter . 
i agree . 
and then the blond that they took out , the one that got killed 
i ca n't remember what her name is , 
i did n't enjoy her . 
and i think that 's what they try to do , 
and they say that there was a conflict between her and him that they never really could get her into any character that they could use . 
the second lady ? 
the second one the blond 
they did n't . 
they were never partners . 
she would go her way , 
and he would do his , 
and i think that 's what i did n't like . 
but it seemed like it was almost two different organizations , 
hunter was the boss , 
and this other girl was not , 
and you 're wondering , when did this happen ? 
so 
i kind of agree with that . 
and i like the new lady better , 
but i 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there . 
i 'd just as soon have the police story without all the romance . 
i 'm afraid that 's what they really wanted to do , 
i think most shows were doing that , 
and then they went away from it 
and now they 're starting to go back to it , 
and maybe that 's what the public wants , 
i do n't know , 
but i like the cut and dry solve the mystery , 
and that 's what i always enjoyed about it . 
but they started it , 
and then they 'd pull it back , 
and they 'd start it and pull it back . 
and that really made it a very interesting show to where you never really knew which one was going to show up whether it was going to , where they 're going to be real close or whether they 're just going to be partners 
and , that i kind of thought was good , 
you always kind of sit there 
and you see these two people together , 
and you always wonder , why they do n't get together or whatever . 
and so i guess that 's what they decide to do 
just go ahead and quit the wondering 
maybe it 's not a good example . 
the last day , all they did was the last season , to where the two of them got married 
and that was the killer , 
i was going to say , i did n't ever watch moonlighting , 
go ahead . 
but i heard that 's what killed it 
same thing . 
and so the show died . 
it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they get married , 
the minute they get married , everything 's supposed to be cut and dried 
and , of course , another one of their mistakes is they have a tendency to change characters , or to change the characters ' personalities especially after they get married . 
why would they do that ? 
it made no sense . 
unfortunately , that 's probably true . 
like in the big soap opera shows , which i do n't enjoy because of that , 
do you watch who 's the boss ? 
i 've seen it before , 
but i do n't watch it regularly . 
i hardly ever watch it , 
but , as i 've seen it , they 've done sort of the same thing to where they started to let them get together , 
and then they pulled them apart 
and i think they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about . 
so . i always thought that was kind of weird . 
but when he gets married , then you do n't care any more or something like that , 
probably , 
i know it affected me when i was younger . 
i 'm not into rock stars too much lately , 
i do n't particularly like either one of them 
but their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together 
or at least , that 's the way i look at it . 
so i do n't know , 
it would have been hard , would n't it . 
i would think so . 
when you get married you 've got relationship to develop in the first place , 
they would n't be easy . 
that 's kind of interesting . 
i guess that 's about all we need to do , is n't it . 
i think we 've covered our time . 
it 's been good talking to you . 
i really appreciate it . 
you 're the first man i 've talked to , 
everyone else has been a female , 
so this is a change . 
you 're the second female i 've talked to . 
you 've had a little bit of variety . 
it 's kind of nice . 
thanks so much . 
personally , i do n't have any children . 
so children would n't be very convenient for me right now . 
would they , 
how do you spend the time with your children ? 
both of mine are boys . 
and they 're into sports 
as a matter of fact , that 's what we 're doing tonight . 
what are you doing ? 
baseball has started . 
does the eight year old play baseball ? 
we start here at five . 
and in his league do they have a pitcher , 
or do they have a standing ball or a machine , or what ? 
it 's coach pitch , until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in may . 
so he 's going to be with regular pitching 
but 
we 're into baseball , 
and it seems like soon as that we get into basketball . 
there 's always something . 
and how about on the weekends . 
do you do sports 
or do you go out ? 
both . 
if we 're not doing sports we go somewhere . 
usually in the summer time . 
and where do you go ? 
different places every year . 
have you been out of the country ? 
first , they always say , get to know your country first before you leave , 
and that must be the thing . 
they really had n't either . 
they went to the memorial , 
when they go , it 's on business 
it 's not really just getting to sight see . 
it 's a beautiful city . 
i bet it is , too . 
and that was the most boring place on earth . 
my husband and i , we go different places . 
but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close . 
but now , i do n't know , 
but let 's see , 
that was fun . 
that was , 
my sister lives in turkey , 
and my parents live down there . 
so , all the traveling i do is alone . 
that was a lot of fun . 
but , what happens is we used to fight a lot , 
so there 's never much of a family thing . 
my husband also , we 're involved in everything our kids does 
because my dad died when i was less than a year old 
so i always just had a mother . 
so i always thought , when i have kids i really want to be involved with them . 
my dad , all he wanted to do was get money for us , 
so he could buy us material things . 
material things , 
it 's we never threw a football or something 
and he wants me now , 
he wants to be best friends now 
best friends , now . 
and it 's very hard for me 
because it 's like you grow up to be twenty years old , 
and it 's always the same man 
and then suddenly he sees that he 's getting old , 
and he wants to be best friends 
but it 's i can only express myself so much , 
because everything that my family taught me , . 
it 's i love you 
and let 's go out and do things together when i do n't feel like it 
i 've seen my uncle and his family does everything together , 
when his little girl was five years old and everything they would go to the beach , 
and she could go to sleep at two in the morning 
and i was brought up the same way , 
it does n't matter what age you have , 
just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning , you can stay up , 
you have to 
you honestly do . 
i have friends that i love to death , 
and they have children , 
but their children does anything , 
we have to take them , to do it . 
and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while 
because you 're saying , i work full time too . 
you might have problems , 
but it 's not your kids ' problems , 
thing is , that if they would ever happen to have a drug problem , suppose , that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying , i got a problem , 
problem , 
and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time , 
first of all you 're coming to me 
and let 's see how we can get rid of the problem , 
and that 's very hard to do , 
because once you 're best friends with your parents , then , i think everything go a lot better . 
i agree with you very much so . 
we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college , 
it would not have been a good idea to had them then . 
my father was raising three kids before he had me , 
you 're trying , to support four kids , 
and it 's pretty hard , 
and i told him , you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids . 
but then i would n't have you , 
but then you would have a lot of money . 
that 's right , 
but you ca n't take this money with us , though 
that 's how i keep looking at it . 
but four children is expensive especially for me , . 
i 'm paying three thousand , 
what is it , two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester . 
and people say it 's expensive to think it 's college , 
but , if everybody would be a little bit responsible , 
what does it cost . 
it costs five hundred dollars a semester . 
they go to a state college 
and they live at home , 
and it costs two hundred dollars for books , 
but seven hundred dollars a semester , 
if you can , 
it 's like , if you plan a year ahead , you can probably save up seven hundred dollars one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college . 
what are you learning to be ? 
excuse me ? 
what are you wanting to do after you get out of college ? 
i 'm doing computer engineering . 
my husband 's into computers . 
and now i 'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home 
my dad wants me to go back . 
and you do n't want to ? 
because if you go back there , then you can never get out . 
you do n't have any money to , get out . 
and , i was thinking i go back there , 
and i get married there , 
and now i have kids there , 
and then i 'll never leave the place . 
then you 'll never leave . 
i know , 
and that 's what happened to my brother . 
he came to school up here , 
and then when he went down there , he was just so bad off from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain . 
maybe something will open up for you . 
i 've been calling a lot of companies . 
there , 
some of them are interested . 
at least for a year and a half i can work , 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
same here . 
the subject is big city crime , which is something that i do n't have any first hand experiences about , 
but i have concerns , 
and i have a few ideas of how to combat it . 
i do n't think , ideally you need money to do everything 
so that 's one thing 
that 's crime that you ca n't fight it if you need that money . 
and it 's always been a very large city , and increasingly growing . 
it has kind of the split population . 
there 's a lot of retired military individuals that live there , 
and that has been the worse thing that we 've seen happening . 
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the , retired people 's community , 
or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods ? 
but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies , rape and car crime . 
there 's a very high percentage of car theft . 
so a lot of the cars go to shops , 
and they take them apart , 
so that 's a big concern if you live there , is to really lock your car up . 
very much so , 
very much so , 
in fact , for a while there downtown if you were to come to a stop light , they had a rash of when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up . 
so now , ever since then , when you drive into the city , most people keep their doors locked while they 're in the car , until they get down there , 
and once you 've reached the river walk area , which is the tourist area , it 's usually pretty safe during the day , if you 're just kind of cautious and do n't go down the back streets or alleys or alone . 
but at evening again , they have the high tourist area , the river walk area , which is nice , 
but you do n't want to get off the beaten track . 
there 's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight . 
and so you do n't want to get caught in the parking garage alone . 
we were there just for a lay over 
and it was n't a lay over , 
we were staying at the other end of the island , 
it was at night , 
and this boy really wanted to go on the beach , 
and they look at you crazy 
you do n't go on the beach . 
it 's a big tourist town , 
do n't people go for a walk on the beach at night ? 
and they said , no , 
it 's very safe in the daytime 
it 's just so sad , 
it is just really so sad , 
it is just really so sad because you ca n't enjoy anything any more . 
education is a lot of it . 
there 's a lot of drugs that go on , and that they just have hopeless lives . 
they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels . 
i think education helps a little bit there . 
what they say they try to do is to get the kids early and young . 
they set up kids with elderly people , 
in the winter time they shovel their snow . 
they have a big brother , big sister program . 
they have bottle drives , 
they have cleanup outings . 
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school , you might keep them 
but again , you need that one on one like a big brother , trying to tell him , stay in school , 
it 'll get better , 
so that your mom does n't have a job 
and she does n't work , 
you do n't know , 
you can be better than that . 
you do n't have to live for a street life . 
that 's good , 
that sounds like they 've got a lot going on there . 
but it 's so cheap 
they do n't have a problem here . 
they can deal with that scale . 
they might have five hundred troubled youths . 
the kids now , it 's twelve years old 
and they 're selling drugs 
i guess everybody 's responsible for the society , 
they do n't care about anybody 
these people they 're stealing from , they 're just the big bad rich guy 
and we do n't have it , 
so we deserve it , 
and we should take it . 
i do n't know how you combat that . 
i do n't know where you start with a lot of these kids , 
so many of them , all they see is just the gangs 
i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible , too . 
we 're talking these kids are fourteen years old . 
the parents might be thirty years old 
and i 'm thirty years old , 
and i 'm kind of irresponsible , 
if i was going to go out and drink or do something , i would n't do it in front of my child . 
and they bring their drugs home 
and the kids are just sitting there in the same room . 
it 's just that they have absolutely no morals 
and it 's really sad . 
and i do n't know how you combat that . 
i do n't know what the answer is to that problem . 
but i like your idea of education 
if the parents are n't supplying it , they 've got to get it from someone else from the schools , 
and what do those kids do , 
they get it at school and come home , 
what do they do then . 
i feel for them , 
i do n't know how to make it better for them 
they ca n't remove themselves , 
they ca n't just leave and say it 's not acceptable , 
i 'm leaving the big city , mom , 
and i 'm going off , 
when they 're ten , they have to live in it , 
it 's really sad , 
if they did have a big brother , big sister program 
those people trying to help the kids , 
the parents might have hostilities towards them like you 're judging us , 
i think so , 
and i 'm not good enough to raise my child , which basically is true 
i 'm glad i do n't live in a big city not just because i would n't feel safe , 
it 's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i do n't see , 
it was just a matter of who was shot that night , 
i know it 
they have all kinds of nice write ups about it 
but there 's a lot of them , 
but any big city has a bad section . 
it 's very prevalent , 
a lot of the crime is very prevalent . 
they 're very bold it seems . 
very much . 
most everybody seems pretty well employed around here , 
and there 's a lot of crime there , 
so , it 's pretty quiet , 
we walk the streets at night , 
and people run in the park , 
i can walk the streets . 
i would n't , 
if i did it every night i think there would be trouble in our house , 
so you would n't get confronted or anything 
but i do n't think you would , 
someone might grab you , mess around with you , 
that 's what you 're going to have to expect that to happen . 
i 'll have to keep that in mind . 
and i never really got into that too much , because you have to get in the boat really to do anything , 
and i did n't know anybody who had a boat , 
so i do n't fish too much in saltwater . 
and i have caught one or two small sharks 
and . 
what 'd you do with them ? 
put them back . 
you did n't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do ? 
i love shark steak , 
but the ones i caught were never large enough to really do anything . 
do they have a limit on sharks , 
is that a sport fish , 
can you actually catch those 
and there 's no limit . 
is there a limit ? 
i have no idea . 
so , they do a lot of shark fishing in the gulf 
i think i 've been trout fishing once . 
i have n't . 
i do n't know that i could do that . 
i 've tried it once , 
did you . 
did n't like it ? 
i could never get the hang of it . 
it looks complicated to me . 
it 's a rhythm or something . 
catching tree bass , 
almost got an owl once . 
did you . 
that would have been something . 
or do you eat what you fish . 
there are people who fish , 
and then there are people who catch . 
you just like to sit down and watch it . 
that 's right , 
i 've never caught that much , 
that 's nice . 
what about you 
i have n't been really in a long time . 
that was real fun . 
but i went fishing at lake worth . 
and we went fishing there last memorial day , 
and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep . 
i was so excited . 
and that 's really about it . 
mostly just the lakes around here , 
and i fish to take home and cook . 
i do n't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching . 
i get a little bit of relaxation from it , 
but mainly i want to say i brought something home . 
i want to say i did this , 
i was out there for a reason . 
the last time i went bass fishing , i was with my daughter , a friend of hers , and a friend of mine and his daughter . 
i was the only one who did not catch , a single fish 
my daughter caught fish , 
his daughter caught fish , 
he caught fish . 
everybody but you . 
i was out on a party boat a few years ago , 
it had to be you . 
could n't catch one to save your life . . 
that 's right , 
i would go from one side of the boat to the other , 
and the party boat captain could not understand , 
how funny , 
and it was really , really , really bad . 
i 'm not a catcher . 
but i enjoy it though . 
i do n't really get out as much as i would like too . 
and they do a lot of fishing there . 
that would be fun . 
and that i was able to do , when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom . 
hand picked . 
that right . 
and we had been fishing in a canal , 
they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area , 
and we 'd been fishing in the canals 
and all we were catching were catfish , 
and we were pretty bored with that . 
so , we thought maybe there are some crab in here , 
we 'll try to catch some crab . 
i had a rock to weight it down , 
something grabs and just runs with it . 
and of course there 's no hook , 
so it ca n't be a fish . 
i 'm sure it 's not a fish , 
and crab , they do n't bite like that , 
they do n't just run with your food . 
so , i netted it , 
it had real teeth , like human teeth , 
and it looked archaic . 
i had no idea what it was . 
i called my father long distance just to describe the thing , 
and it had the rock in its mouth , not the chicken , 
but the rock itself is what it had grabbed . 
they say it 's a dog fish , from everything i 've described , 
i 'll never get over that . 
to this day i do n't want to get in the water , anywhere around salt water because i 'm sure one of those fish are there . 
i do n't know if you 've ever heard of it 
i 've never heard of that one . 
and it has a huge strong mouth , 
that 's where it gets its name , obviously . 
i guess the largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long , 
but just huge , ugly things just terrible . 
can you eat them ? 
i do n't think i 'd want to even if you could if they 're that ugly , 
they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them . 
that 's like this dog fish , 
it scared me to death . 
it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died . 
and i threw my line out 
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark , which was probably a foot , and a half or two feet long , 
and scared me to death . 
and then i felt something relatively heavy , 
and i thought , here , i 'm really going to get one . 
on this subject , i really had n't had to deal with putting someone in there yet , 
but my mother 's always been administrator of a nursing home 
so i 've always been involved in one . 
how do you feel about them since you 've kind of been close to that . 
i can kind of see both sides , 
i really can . 
i would personally be the last resort if i had to put someone in there . 
i 've had a touch of experience . 
if it 's a have to thing , 
and she put him in , 
but he was n't there very long before he died 
but we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of keep him real out of it all the time 
and that 's always kind of bothered me . 
i kind of think that 's true , too because it 's so under staffed 
that 's like everything else , though . 
i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home , 
but i 've never actually been there 
and i know that she 's the kind of person who would n't allow a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about . 
but still i 'm sure there are aspects to it that are n't really desirable . 
i know , 
my sister 's involved in one also , 
and i really think they really do a wonderful job . 
but still there 's those little things that happens 
i think , it 's a wonderful place if it comes to that if you just ca n't take care of them any more . 
sometimes you do n't have any other alternative 
that 's it . 
family 's tied up with their own lives and things , and usually working 
other things . 
but i think when the time comes , i hope to have the time to really look around and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at . 
i think that 's important , too , 
i do too . 
there 's one close to where my mother is , 
but in order to get in , you have to be able to walk in on your own , 
in other words , you ca n't be in too bad a shape to start out with . 
but then if you deteriorate they have a separate section for those who need care all the time . 
and they have a long waiting list , too . 
so there 's always this feeling of , you 've got to be able to walk in the door , 
so you ca n't wait until you 're too bad off 
off , 
but then , you do n't want to go do that when you do n't have to because you have to give up your automobile or whatever . 
and everything you worked so hard for all your life 
so that 's a hard one , 
but it is a very nice nursing home . 
there is some really nice ones . 
there 's also some private ones 
but of course , i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that , 
that 's the problem 
that 's way out of my reach . 
and another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money , and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately . 
but those who do n't have money can go in and get the same care . 
the very same , 
so i do n't like that aspect . 
they could put it in one of their children 's names or something . 
but still , a lot of them does n't feel comfortable doing that . 
it 's their money . 
that 's right . 
that 's how i feel about it , anyway . 
i 've talked to my mother about that several times lately , 
and i said , i want you to have control of your own business . 
so naturally she 's retired , 
but she 's still on her own , i mean . 
i think that 's wonderful , 
i really do , 
just as long as they can , 
and then on the other hand , i 've seen some people go into the nursing home . 
that 's true . 
they have a lot of people around to do things with . 
they 're not lonely . 
some of those places have wonderful activities and things lots of stuff going on . 
and they 'll take them places 
. i do n't know , 
it 's not all bad 
but i guess once you get ill , then you really have some problems if you ca n't get around and do things . 
around , 
but i really do n't know what the other solution would be , 
i really do n't . 
but 
when the time comes hopefully we 'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents 
really do , 
because i have been raised in one , 
so there 's lot of things i know to look for . 
and i do n't think they 'd want to go where they used to work , either . 
i really do n't . 
that might be kind of tough . 
it really would , 
and like i said , my sister 's still in it , 
and i really do n't think my mother 'd want to be there , either . 
it 's been nice talking to you . 
you too . 
and i guess we 'd better get back to work . 
what do you think about it ? 
how are we doing in recycling ? 
i think we need to do more . 
i know i need to do more . 
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up . 
but i have a hard time of separating my trash , and get all the cans from the paper , 
and i just have n't gotten that dedicated yet . 
and we try to do a lot 
but there 's still a lot more we can do . 
so i figured i might get me one of those because we do n't always read the newspaper . 
sometimes it just sits around for a while , 
i do n't get the paper every day , 
but that 's the extent of what i 've done . 
i 'd like to be able to do more . 
it 's not always convenient to do it . 
i can imagine what it 's like up there . 
i 'm not exactly sure where the can thing is , 
and then i put me a little five gallon bucket , 
and it 's just outside the garage door 
so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket . 
and it 's actually metal 
it 's not plastic . 
i did n't want to buy a plastic one . 
because those things would just snap . 
and they 're metal , 
but it was only seven dollars , 
not too bad . 
i 'd have to check into something like that , because we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here , 
but occasionally we have some around , 
but for other kind of cans , it 'd probably only take aluminum cans like that , do n't they . 
i do n't think it would crush steel cans , 
it 's pretty tough . 
so . i do n't know , 
i do n't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that , 
but , i need to look into it more , 
sometimes , even with the newspaper they say they 'll only take certain types of paper , 
they wo n't take paper that 's shiny , 
so does my husband , 
we do a lot of recycling out there . 
but that 's just now come on board . 
we 've been throwing paper out there away for years , 
and we 're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big earth day thing came out . 
i 'm sure they 're probably doing that here some . 
i 'm sure they are . 
i think it 's necessary , 
i like it , 
i think it 's good that you see these boxes , cereal , 
they 're now starting to make the packages out of recycled paper , 
and i 've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper , 
and i think they 're just fine . 
i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work , 
it 's his birthday , 
we 're pretty good friends , 
and what it is is a recycled paper bag 
and it 's just got happy birthday printing on it , and a cute little phrase inside , 
and it 's just a paper bag 
and it 's really cute . 
but , i think we 're doing better and better all the time , 
i think we 're becoming more conscious because we just ca n't stick everything in landfills any more . 
there 's not going to be any room , shortly . 
i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere . 
but i think we 're getting better at it 
i think there 's quite a bit more we could do . 
girls , put that away . 
now . 
but , you 're right sometimes it does seem like it 's more trouble than what it would be worth . 
i just wish it was a little more convenient to do , 
seems like you 're so busy anyway , 
and then that 's just one more thing to have to worry about . 
it sure is . 
i think if the cities , locally they 'd get more programs going so that you could do that , it 'd make it a lot easier . 
i guess the schools will get into it , too , sooner or later . 
get the kids interested in it too . 
and we just do n't have any place to store those kind of cans . 
if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people they 'll save them for us , 
there 's no problem there . 
but what do you do with them in the meantime ? 
that 's right . 
i do n't want a garage full of cans . 
that 's right , 
who does . 
people do n't have room for that kind of stuff . 
they 're not prepared for it . 
things like that , they just get bugs in them . 
they do . 
the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get , 
that 's for sure . 
that 's right , 
i 'm pretty lazy about it right now . 
pick it up . 
myself . 
i need to get better at it . 
if we all try a little bit , a little bit goes a long way . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
if everybody tries to do just a little bit , and a little bit more then we 'll get there . 
that 's true . 
that 's right . 
thank you for talking to me . 
thank you for calling . 
no problem , 
take care . 
let 's see , 
i believe in the trial by jury . 
and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody . 
i really agree with the innocent until proven guilty theory . 
i think that 's a good way to do it . 
that 's about all . 
i think basically we 're in a lot of agreement in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs some kind of legal definition . 
but for anything involving that , trial by jury certainly should be mandatory . 
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of , not having to take everything before a full court , 
is n't there a type of word called a jury duty now . 
and those cases are lesser degrees of magnitude , 
and he had his pockets full of stuff when he was caught 
that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say , your pleasure your honor , 
and there 's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing . 
but the way our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time . 
and we 're starting to stretch the true meaning of right to a speedy trial . 
that 's a good idea . 
do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury 
or do they need a six person jury or those kinds of things 
and the seriousness of it , 
how , 
is this open and shut like you were saying , 
or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened a jury like that . 
that could work . 
and although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers , maybe we do n't need to do that . 
good idea . 
and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case . 
and let 's get rid of some of this harassment suing . 
that 's a good idea . 
in the bible it says if you have something against somebody , to go to them first , and if that does n't work , then to go get somebody a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them , and if that does n't work , to take it to the whole church . 
so that 's right off that same kind of principle . 
you bet , 
that 's a good idea . 
that 's true , 
that 's true , too . 
the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that . 
it does n't work on that , 
but it 's based out of that . 
so that could work , 
i 'd forgotten what that 's called . 
what is that called ? 
that may be right . 
it 's in there some place . 
i think we both know that we 're talking about the foundation of our legal society . 
i know , 
but that 's a whole different subject . 
mine , too . 
mine , too . 
but it 's been a pleasure talking with you . 
same here . 
what part of the country are you from ? 
i was just being curious . 
that 's quite all right . 
so am i . 
that 's neat . 
are you really ? 
i 'll let you go . 
and it was nice talking to you . 
my pleasure . 
have a good day . 
you too . 
what are some of your favorite foods ? 
we got what some people call the best beef in the world . 
in our house , it 's already built in . 
there 's this whole special place in the back 
so you can make a barbecue . 
and it 's marvelous . 
i have to find a place around here that has that . 
i 'll keep that in mind , 
you serve that yourself , or for a family ? 
excuse me ? 
you ever serve that yourself when you have company ? 
but when i 'm down at home 
and somebody says when are we having this , 
and i 'll cook it . 
and then you put all these different meats which take different times . 
you do n't go buy it from a wholesaler . 
little butcher shops , 
so i know . 
and so they got the meat place . 
and so you just go there 
and , you ca n't find chicken there , 
you got to go to another place to find the chicken . 
you have poultry place . 
what dishes do you serve with it ? 
the turnover , 
i love those , 
and then that 's to start out with . 
and then what you have is also three different kinds of salad . 
and that 's about it . 
he moved , 
so that 's before your time . 
your parents might remember if they were here then . 
we were only there for two years . 
he was wonderful . 
are you ? 
this was around the turn of the century . 
i 'll tell you , 
and we both love continental cooking , french cooking . 
we do n't usually mix . 
and there are really easy recipe 
you can steam many of the things in a microwave . 
i do n't know if you have one . 
is it ? 
it 's like , when you go buy fish 
i buy the fish 
so you can do it in the microwave the breaded fish , 
and 
what kind of fish ? 
any white fish . 
sole is good , 
flounder 
sole or flounder is real good . 
because i got , one of those little microwaves , the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water . 
i do n't . 
wait , 
wait , 
wait , 
either way they 'll spell it . 
how much pork do you buy for two people . 
i could probably go half a pound . 
you can also do the same thing if you have ground beef . 
just stir fry the ground beef . 
drain off the oil . 
just stir that in 
and you 've got another dish . 
and how much does it cost ? 
a can would serve you for quite a few meals . 
it 's not expensive at all . 
listen , 
it was good talking with you . 
same here . 
hope you enjoy your recipe . 
thank you . 
the first thing what do you think you would offer as far as information about selecting a school ? 
first i think they 've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do . 
once they have that , then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves , and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer . 
depending upon the field , i know there are some fields which a person should go to that school , all four years , 
but i know there are some fields where it 's really not necessary . 
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff are n't really concerned with your first two years anyway . 
it 's your core education , your general education requirements . 
if they want to get a liberal arts degree , i do n't know what advice i 'd give them . 
go to the school you 'd like to go to . 
that 's what i did . 
i did n't care about the program or anything else . 
i went where i wanted to go . 
what was your degree in ? 
political science . 
political science , 
i 'm going to school right now , 
and i have a friend , 
where are you at ? 
i know . 
i think that i 've noticed that 
i have a friend , 
i think if you 're going into law or medicine , a very particular , very specific field , even engineering , you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public institution . 
and it 's a lot cheaper . 
my parents made a mistake in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years . 
and she found out after that , 
she said my parents , they really wasted a lot of money . 
this is about twenty years ago . 
as far as selecting a school , i feel that a lot of it depends upon the major . 
it does . 
i did n't know what i wanted to do after i got my degree . 
and i went ahead and pursued that . 
i got as far as the thesis , and decided , to hell with it , 
i did n't want it . 
and from that point i went to law school . 
and after a year and a half of that i decided i did n't want that either . 
have n't figured out what i want to be when i grow up . 
but i really did enjoy the law . 
that 's where i wanted to be , 
i just wanted a law degree . 
and i 've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field . because that 's the nuts and bolts of the law , and that 's what i like , 
and you do n't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to . 
so that 's what i 'm pursuing right now 
and i 'm pretty happy with it so far . 
i 'm a speech therapy major 
that 's probably very useful . 
it 's actually turning out to be more useful than what i thought . 
it 's all working together . 
the only field i 'm not familiar with really is education , which requires about four or five different fields really . 
i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher , 
but i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while , just to get my feet wet . 
i said i could n't do this everyday . 
but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing . 
you are a disgruntled graduate student . 
i am just a disgruntled person all around . 
i think law would be a fine profession , fine field to go into . 
i know one time i was in a political science class , 
and talking about fields , people going into different fields , i made an off the cuff remark about lawyers , about their integrity being questionable . 
you probably got everybody on you , because they were probably all going to law school . 
there was a woman , 
she said my best friends are lawyers and all this , 
my best friends are lawyers . 
i know . 
my best friends are blacks . 
now blacks 
i know , 
law was a lot of fun until you get to law school 
and it does n't become fun anymore . 
i have a friend . 
she 's going into law , 
another friend going into law , 
what 's going to happen when she gets there . 
all of her dreams will be dispelled . 
if you 've ever seen the program paper chase it 's very much like that , except worse . 
i think it 's probably more embarrassing and very painful . 
it is . 
i see that happening . 
very much so . 
it 's a lot of that . 
it was enjoyable for a while , 
, you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it . 
if you have any doubts whatsoever , you better not get into it . 
and i aged ten years . 
but i would n't trade the experience for anything in the world . 
it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law . 
i went to a language school , 
and it was an united states institution . 
i was military at the time . 
what branch were you in ? 
what branch were you in ? 
i was in the air force ? 
i was too . 
for myself i think that military experience was fine , 
i got tired of the service after a while 
it , 
i had a terrific job , really enjoyed it . 
what was your job ? 
command post . 
i was n't . 
i did n't go flight crew . 
matter of fact , i did n't make it completely through that field . 
i , was in intelligence school and about three weeks short . 
i did n't make it , 
i sort of washed out . 
they actually should do some reading 
that 's right , 
and if it 's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it . 
and they should study it . 
i think there 's a lot to be said for kids working after school . 
they find out just how much of a people person they are . 
that 's true , 
i found that out when i was in high school . 
and i tell you what , 
and i can tell you one thing , 
and i eventually worked as a lab technician , 
and i worked front desk . 
and somebody could walk in the door , 
and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say . 
i was the same way too . 
i 'm not a people person . 
it 's just not for me . 
i deal much better in research and books , and stuff like that which is why i 'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot . 
that 's good . 
i do n't think that it 's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions . 
for instance , jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there 's , endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives . 
i agree with that . 
people that are driving like truck drivers and things like that . 
i definitely think they should be tested . 
and i 'm not opposed to any testing . 
how do you feel about companies drug testing prior to hiring ? 
i was tested within my company . 
because i do n't know of any other countries that are doing this 
and i feel like it 's really just within the united states . 
it 's okay . 
i think your record should stand for itself . that if you 've been tested at other companies and you 've always come up negative or whatever , then i do n't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over . 
and once you 've established the fact that you 're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you 're not . i think they could save money by not doing that every time , 
if you change jobs you would n't have to do it if you 'd just been tested at your other work place . 
what about random testing , though . 
do you feel like that 's an invasion of certain people 's rights if not everyone is tested ? 
not if it 's done fairly . 
and that 's probably my question is , how do you know it 's done fairly . 
i do n't know that you do . 
if it 's random , then it 's random 
and that 's not necessarily fair . 
they might tell you it 's random . 
but then it 's kind of like a lottery . 
somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries . 
and it 's not random . 
i see . 
how do they pick their people ? 
i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season 
but it 's almost discretionary on the coach 's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem . 
i see . 
do you think that should be implemented in the work place 
as a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs , do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested . 
not being a drug user i do n't have a problem with that personally 
but i think that might be a violation of someone 's rights . 
if someone 's having personal problems for some reason that 's causing them to behave differently 
and their manager assumes they have a drug problem 
if someone assumed that of me , i would be upset . 
and it 's based on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave normal . 
and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and your supervisor has accused you of using drugs . 
i agree with that . because i know personally myself , i 've been in the same job for three years , 
it will be three years in august 
and i 've already been drug tested three times . 
what type of job do you have ? 
i 'm an environmental engineer 
and i 've been drug tested three times 
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime 
so for some reason , i 've come up three times . 
that 's pretty high statistics . 
does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone ? 
not at all . 
it 's a legal job 
so it 's really strange . 
that is odd . 
i was drug tested not for the job i have now , but for the prior job , 
the job i have now , requested my , medical record from my old company 
so i do n't know if i was n't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me did n't request the drug test , because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion . 
for instance , does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say we 've already drug tested her 
and she came up negative . 
they do n't know that i do n't use drugs . 
they just tested me once . 
but , i used to work for a power company , 
and since i was just one of the office folk , i guess it was n't as important to them that they test me regularly . 
but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly just across the board . 
and are they tested random ? 
it 's a rotation . 
i see . 
but again , it depends on what job you 're in . 
the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot 
and the men that drive the trucks with the guys that fix the power lines are n't tested as much . 
but they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the drug testing schedule is . 
i see . 
they say we 're testing you tomorrow 
and we 'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here . 
so they know that . 
it 's made very clear upon hiring . 
have we spent our at least five minutes ? 
i think so . 
nice speaking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
is it doing a good job or a bad job 
and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do . 
and are you talking about public schools being lower level , high school level or state school . 
but you 're excluding high-level education . 
i am . 
i do n't think there 's so much of a problem there . 
it 's pretty much funded well . 
there are small colleges that i 'm sure are struggling 
i would n't let them go to a public school system there . 
but , of course , people are trapped economically 
and they ca n't do that . 
i do n't know , 
and the schools down here rate bottom ten percent across the country 
and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why . 
because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed , half the time the teachers do n't know what 's going on . 
that 's really too bad because it 's giving some people unfair advantage . 
what we learned . 
that was my experience going through junior high up there 
when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i 'd already done . because we were so far advanced . 
and i 'd been in a parochial school before junior high 
and even the public schools are behind the parochial schools . 
so i like the concept they 've got now where they have more directed education , 
you pick a career path 
or you get counseling earlier 
and then you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over . 
they talk about it 
or if you 're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art . 
i 'm an engineering student 
and if i have to go take art classes i 'm not going to use them . 
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i 'd gone to a school that was directed . 
that 's true . 
i was fortunate . 
i 'm a technician 
in high school . 
they do n't know what to do , 
there 's too many kids and not enough teachers 
and too many of the kids do n't care . 
i find that in the cities , it 's more like the kids go there so socialize not really to learn 
and the parents send them there because they 're supposed to , 
plus it gets them out of their hair . 
and i also find that you can send a kid to school , 
but if do n't work with them as a parent , i think you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage . 
and there 's some kids that want to go learn , 
but most of them just want to go play . 
or maybe they 're unemployed 
and they 're mad at the world , 
i can see where that would n't be very good for a kid , 
he 's coming up , will you help me with my homework 
and they 're , get away from me , 
i 've had a terrible day . 
so , it 's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from . 
that 's true . 
not at the moment , 
i do n't know about that , 
but a lot of the industry up in the northern states is moving south 
and i 'm wondering if that 's going to have any effect on what you see now . 
we 're behind down here . 
i say we because i live here . 
maybe they 'll bring their good schools with them , 
if the industry comes hopefully they 'll promote good schools . 
plus for the type of student that 's going to that school , it 's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists . 
you 're most likely to do better in school . 
they 're going to help you . 
you hope . 
you hope . 
i do n't know . 
i just think it 's a duty of the parent to do that . 
my parents always helped me 
and , i do n't know , 
it 's just like you say , 
it 's the way you 're raised and the economic situation you 're in . 
i can see some lady , 
and she 's got four kids . 
i do n't see where she 's going to have much time for them . 
so , i do n't know . 
i guess you just have to wonder , 
who 's supposed to make the change , 
the state , the federal government , 
where 's the money supposed to come from . 
i do n't know . 
what do you advocate , 
more taxes or better management of what they got ? 
we 're in a recession here . 
our town did n't pass the school budget this year for the first time in many , many years just because people are in the recession 
even though we 've enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years , now we got eight percent unemployment when it used to be four or five . 
starts hitting closer to home . 
it 's all money . 
a couple other topics we had talked about was crime . 
it 's all money based . what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level 
who knows , 
support the church instead . 
they seem to have done a , good job in the past . 
in some places you could n't go to a public school . 
it was miles down the road 
they 're a lot more strict . 
you have to learn , 
i do n't know if i would do that to my child , though . 
i do n't have any good ideas or anything that would contribute . 
is it ? 
i do n't think i 'm getting what i should , 
it 's state supported . 
and it 's really too bad 
i do n't know , 
i think it just builds on the foundation that they 've already built . 
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school . 
we have a very good public school up here 
and a degree out there means a lot . 
it 's a very good school . 
we also have some two year college . 
there 's a four year colleges . 
they all have a pretty good reputation . 
do you think we should adopt it ? 
i do n't like metric system . 
you do n't ? 
the history of our country has been inches 
and i do n't think there 's a big advantage in going to the metric system . 
and there are going to be people who die because of it because they do n't understand simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and how far away something is 
and it 's not in our national consciousness to do it . 
our land is in acres , 
our people are n't going to understand what an amount of something is . 
i agree with you . 
i do n't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system , 
i do n't know 
it seems almost like it 's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we 'll look good to the other nations 
because i think that 's an area that the other nations look down on us like we 're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system , who have n't really attained it yet . 
and i feel it 's just pride of . 
and it 's we 're content with this . 
it 's probably not as accurate , 
probably intellectually does n't , 
it 's not as sound intellectually , 
but , like you said come on . 
i had six years of college 
and i do n't know the metric system 
and i do n't care to learn it 
we have a computer for just about everything now 
and if it 's necessary to translate back and forth between them , it can be done 
because i 'm a mechanical engineer 
and i 've had to work when i was designing packages for people , 
i had to work both systems back and forth 
and it was not hard 
and you can push a button 
and it 'll convert every measurement on there from one system to the other in seconds . 
there 's a lot of people , 
you 're educated , 
i 'm educated , 
my husband is , 
but a lot of people are flat not educated 
but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population they do n't have any college probably much at all 
i think it 's still good they do cover the system . 
i think it should still be taught in schools . 
and they do , 
and that 's acceptable . 
i think it failed , too , because what you said 
this is ridiculous . 
if you look at the average family it 's , like they barely have time to stop and get gas , much less to try and figure out how much gas they 're really getting and do all this . 
it 's come on 
let 's take the pressure , 
you know you need twenty gallons , 
and it 's just like another thing 
just leave them alone , 
let them measure their drinking water in cups 
and leave them alone . 
and it just does n't make that much difference in the average life 
and the scientific community and places where it 's needed that 's fine 
we may not be the top , 
i do n't know if we 're the top , 
we 're one of the top superpowers of the world . 
it may be arrogant , 
but let them come to us . 
that 's kind of the way i feel about it . 
we can convert , 
and if they do n't like the way we do it just do n't worry about it . 
it is 
because it is another language , 
and that 's what i think we ought to do with the metric system . 
that 's funny . 
well , that 's good . 
i think we kept it . 
is that all we need to say ? 
it 's been nice talking to you . 
you , too . 
i think that was good . 
that was the best one . 
usually i get distracted off the topic . 
you know what i mean . 
and we were talking about income tax or something . 
good talking to you . 
anyway , i appreciate it . 
have a good day . 
there we go . 
i think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year . 
i think that 's true . 
so i think we 're a little ahead of schedule on that . 
i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon , 
and i noticed all that grass coming up , 
that 's true . 
it 's been a fun break , 
but the break is over . 
the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny . 
but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it 's gray . 
but i 'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend . 
i go for that , 
in fact , i 'm a little worried about this one coming up here . 
we have a long weekend 
and , it sounds like it 's going to be a little bit on the cool side . 
i have n't heard whether it 's going to rain or not . 
but it 's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow 
and then the rest will be without rain . 
that 's good . 
that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year . 
i have n't seen the weather on the news in the evening lately , 
i 'm not certain either , 
but you 're probably right . 
i do n't like it when it 's too cool or too warm . 
i 'm much more apt to get things done when it 's at that sort of in between temperature . 
that 's true . 
and what that tells me , is that the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't vary very much . 
you 're probably right . 
any other time of year , that 's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold . 
and i think it was one day this week a year ago 
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather 
it was n't just a super bad storm , 
but it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the late spring time . 
i was going into the grocery store , 
and a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead , 
and i thought , i 've never known it to lightening at that temperature . 
that is pretty unusual . 
and you really take notice of it , too . 
that 's right . 
it probably was a lot warmer up high . 
the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and could n't get away . 
i do n't like that super cold stuff . 
i just do n't move very well when it 's that cold . 
i 'm really enjoying this now . 
this has been interesting . 
not too challenging to the brain . 
not a real in depth topic , 
but enjoyed talking to you . 
you have a good day . 
are you a player ? 
i think i am . 
it 's been a while now . 
has it ? 
just recently i got married 
and we bought a house . 
but unfortunately the house is taking up my time . 
so it 's been almost a year since i 've actually swung a club for a purpose . 
i have n't played in about two years , 
and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here . 
and i played in a tournament out there , 
they were kind of , little upset . 
i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits . 
let 's go around this tree , and try a slice through a hook here , 
and i ca n't do that 
i finally got out , 
and i 've been watching quite a few videos . 
i had not been able to play 
so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while , 
and i hope i 'm on the right track . 
and my handicap is twenty nine . 
that 's great . 
i like that . 
now like i say , it 's been a while for me , too . 
i 've got my wife motivated about it , 
and i think that 's probably going to be one of the next investments , is get her a set of clubs 
and we 'll get out of the driving range and get some interest built up 
and hopefully we can start in . 
i bought her a set of clubs four years ago . 
she has n't even swung them , 
but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day , 
she 's ready to get off into it , 
that 's good , 
same thing here . 
at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf 
and it 's not going to cost me an arm and a leg , really . 
and i walk , 
i do n't ride 
i get a little exercise there , too , 
i 've got the same attitude . 
i tell you , 
i guess , the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now , when i was in college . 
and then finally got into it while i was still in school 
so that 's been my main involvement , is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here , 
and then i 'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we ca n't do it back home . 
it 's pretty nice . 
we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not . 
they were amazed . 
we 're out playing golf , 
and they 're freezing cold back there , 
when i got into the service i got into it 
and now when i come out here i just kind of let it go , 
and then one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf . 
and i said , , 
i 've got my clubs , 
but i have n't swung them in quite a few years . 
and then i got into it and then back out of it , 
and it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there . 
that 's right . 
i really enjoy it . 
it 's really nice . 
it is , 
it 's a lot of fun , especially if you can find somebody that 's got the same level of interest . 
that seem to be the hardest thing . 
that 's true of any sport . 
you do n't want to go out and get beat to death , 
and people do n't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time 
and they do n't like to play with me because i 'm too slow for them , 
but get somebody around your own handicap , 
that 's right , 
never yet have i walked up , 
now i 've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with , 
that 's true . 
they are always friendly . 
that 's true . 
come on out , 
and they do n't mind if you make a mistake , 
it 's pretty nice and friendly out there 
that 's so . 
and you ca n't find that in all sports . 
that 's absolutely right , 
but you play with the same people , you are n't going to learn anything . 
after a short period , once you learn everything they 've got to offer , then you 've basically tapped your resources there . 
but eventually i 'd like to work up and maybe get involved in a mixed doubles league , or something like that . 
we get a mixed league in , 
and that 's what i 'm trying to get her ready for . 
it 's going to start when we change time back whenever that is next month , 
and it will start then , 
and we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago , 
and they were just starting to learn , 
and they were shooting a hundred , hundred and twenty 
so , it wo n't take her long , 
that 's good 
that 's good , 
that sounds like a lot of fun . 
and it 's something we can do together , 
so . she does n't do much hunting , 
she could care less about that . 
she does a little fishing , 
but golf would give her the exercise , 
she 'd be outside , 
give her something to do that we both enjoy , 
it sounds like we 've got real similar situations . 
and the last time i took my wife along 
and kind of the same situation . 
she 's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff , 
but she 'll make the trip for fishing if that comes along , 
but it 's interesting , 
bowling you feel bad if you bowl a hundred . 
you do n't have to be an expert to play , 
that 's right . 
any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right . 
so you do n't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all . 
that 's right , 
i 've kind of formed the attitude that if i could pick two or three shots out of my game every time and put them together on one hole , then i do pretty good 
and i keep rationalizing that i can do it , 
i just got to do it all on the same hole , 
and then it will get better , 
and you just keep going , 
and in the meantime , just enjoy what you 're doing . 
it really works that way . 
and when i first got back into it , i used to get mad because i knew i could do something 
and i did n't get it done . 
and i need to slice this ball around here , 
i naturally slice anyway , 
now the ball will go straight 
i never broke a club or anything , 
but i 'd get upset about it sometimes , 
i do n't get upset any more . 
and that 's great . 
i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
you bet . 
i guess i 'll go back to work . 
sounds like it . 
see you later . 
and you 're talking about credit cards . 
we put ours up . 
i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up . 
i wish i had . 
you should try it . 
it was done for me after a while . 
i had a business going . 
i do n't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that . 
but i had a coin shop , 
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up , 
and it started falling . 
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards , 
and things got worse and worse , 
and finally . 
you lost your business ? 
what a nightmare . 
it was . 
it was one of those things , 
it 'll get better next week . 
things will pick up . 
and , so , there i was in old bankruptcy court . 
you were n't charging gold and silver were you ? 
you ca n't do that , can you ? 
you can ? 
i was buying from other dealers , 
and they take payment any way they can get it . 
that 's a nightmare . 
course on merchandise that i was buying on cards , i was getting the money back , 
because i was selling it . 
i was n't buying just to hold onto it . 
but it was things like rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up . 
when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those credit card applications , 
of course you fill them all out because you 're honored . 
and it got up to couple of hundred dollars , 
and i thought , that 's okay , cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month . 
i was n't thinking a thing about it . 
i was just stupid , 
and every time they had a sale , there i was . 
because get such good bargains . 
and i do n't know . 
we 've been getting those . 
i went back to school and got my master 's , 
and they started sending those things to me again . 
as soon as you 're a graduate student they get your name . 
they did . 
and course , i guess i 've been purged from their records . 
back when i had my business i got one . 
and the bill would come in , 
and i 'd pay it . 
and the very first bill , i paid it , 
and then i got this nasty letter from them saying , you 're overdue , 
pay . 
so i said , it just crossed in the mail . 
so i did n't do anything about it . 
two weeks later i get another letter , even nastier , 
and said , we 're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do n't pay . 
and i looked at that , 
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank . 
turned out they were n't cheeky . 
they were , 
i tell you . 
they do n't talk about they 're charging that enormous fee every year . 
so what is it now ? 
or 
what do you mean 
for the green card . 
but then , what 's the interest ? 
that 's the card . 
of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in , 
so there is n't any . 
let 's see , 
it 's not too bad . 
credit cards . 
they 're dangerous . 
my parents do n't hardly use them . 
mine do n't either , 
mine do n't either . 
and that 's it . 
i 've got all my gas cards , because i do n't want to carry money around . 
i 'll do that . 
i do use gas cards . 
impact is kind of bad too , though . 
especially if you forget to record those little suckers . 
plastic is just too easy , 
that 's the whole problem with it . 
and you 're tempted if you 've got cash , a little bit of cash , and you do n't have enough for the purchase . 
of course , you got to charge it and keep your cash . 
naturally . 
i got into all kinds of trouble doing that . 
what are you saying ? 
my husband says i might buy it , 
but i do n't really usually consider that an option . 
having been out of the credit game for some years now , i 've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it . 
maybe that 's how we got in trouble . 
but it 's hard , is n't it ? 
it is , 
but , i 'm kind of grateful for the experience because it 's taught me a lot of restraint . 
it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic . 
with cash ? 
i wish i did . 
you could have got a discount , could n't you ? 
i could use a discount . 
i have to wait for things to go on sale . 
but there 's always a sale . 
especially on electronic goods 
especially now . 
what is that thing i saw , 
circuit world or something . 
circuit city . 
circuit city . 
have you been in there ? 
their prices are n't that terrific . 
they used to be , 
but they 've got to pay for all that national advertising now . 
it 's national ? 
they 're all over the country now . 
what else , 
they used to be good . 
i remember when they first opened up . 
they did have good bargains . 
or you probably have something similar . 
we call it service merchandise . 
you got service merchandise . 
it used to be service merchandise was the place to go . 
and circuit city came along 
and then after the years went by , they just sort of kept creeping up on price , 
and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now . 
so much for circuit city . 
what else can we talk about ? 
who do you work for ? 
i do n't , 
i 'm a graduate student . 
i 'm a professional student . 
sounds wonderful . 
it is . 
we were talking about that just today . 
it 's great . 
we could be just lifelong students . 
it is great . 
i love it . 
where are you going to school ? 
what 's that ? 
so you 're on spring break ? 
not yet . 
ours does n't start until next week . 
so where are you ? 
where am i ? 
what do you mean , where ? 
little , 
what a dead place . 
is it ? . 
i 've got a nice little business at home , 
so what are you getting your degree in ? 
human factors . 
and what do you do with it ? 
not a thing . 
what is it ? 
it 's sociology . 
it 's more psychology and engineering . 
my master 's is in industrial engineering . 
so you 're working on your doctorate ? 
that will sound wonderful , wo n't it ? 
get you a little plaque . 
a lot of people use human factors , folks , 
are n't they laying off several thousand people ? 
they might be , 
i heard it on the news today , 
if they 'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me . 
how much longer do you have ? 
and get that done this summer ? 
i 'm going to start this summer . 
i probably wo n't finish it until the end of the year 
why ? 
there has been so much work done already ? 
that 
and , it 's limited application in some respects . 
in the area that we 're in here , there 's a lot of places that use human factors people . 
what kind of car are you thinking about getting ? 
none at the moment . 
when you decide to . 
i have had it for about two years now 
and it 's everything it 's supposed to be . 
i have n't had a minute 's trouble with it 
and so it 's a little bit larger . 
but that 's the only difference that i see , really . 
and i loved it , 
i really did . 
but i finally decided to go check out what the , foreign cars were . 
i always have , up until now . 
i just for one time decided to go outside . 
and it 's an excellent automobile . 
but , price and so forth , 
i 'm not a real car fan . 
i do not opt for something that would be expensive , 
i think so too . 
those were not good cars . 
and i was ready to get rid of it two months after i bought it , 
so i shopped around , 
i have a friend who has an auto shop , 
and he just absolutely swore by it . 
there was no comparison . , 
and i drive around a lot , 
and it 's very comfortable on the highway . 
i can drive for ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way . 
but those are my criteria , 
and i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again , 
and if there 's something out there that is comparable to what i have now , i 'll go ahead and get it . 
at the moment i 'm single , 
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it . 
but i do n't have any plans for probably another two , three years of even looking . 
cars are too expensive right now to even think about buying new cars every couple of years 
i ca n't remember what the name is . 
and it 's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth , 
i ca n't conceive of doing that . 
i went to a car show down here about two weeks ago , 
that 's how expensive they were . 
and then you saw hundred thousand dollar cars , 
and even though i do enjoy cars , , i ca n't see paying more for a car than i would for a house . 
that 's true . 
that does n't seem likely . 
the difference there too is between us is that i am not really crazy about driving . 
so i 've never really cared . 
before i was married and before i went to graduate school , i used to do little sports car racing . 
it was never my own car 
it was always someone else 's . 
and that sort of thing i enjoy , 
but to go out and drive never has really had any appeal to me in that regard . 
. i guess we 've discussed that enough do n't you think . 
i think so . 
we wo n't get the recorder or the system to shut us off tonight . 
that 's happened to me once , 
it 's very easy when you get on a topic that you enjoy . 
that had a great conversation , 
but then they came off and told us we could n't do it any more . 
i was talking to a lady last evening , 
and we were talking about fishing , 
and we were cut off , 
we were told to quit . 
you have a pleasant evening . 
you too . 
take care . 
i understand that it 's being proposed as a requirement , for young people to go into public service . 
they did not specify exactly what young means . 
i think that it probably would be a good program . 
i think probably two years is too long . 
i think maybe a year would be , the longest . 
you 're probably right , 
two years might be a little too long . 
and there will be a lot of rebellion in that 
and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place , i do n't think that they 're going to be serving anybody . 
that 's right . 
that would be the problem . 
sure would . 
so i think it would be a good thing though , to encourage other people who are n't even aware that they can do such a thing . to get out there and do so . 
or maybe offer them some sort of an incentive to do it . college credit something , 
i 'm not sure what 
i 'm not sure they need to be paid , a salary of any kind . 
but that kind of takes away from public service . 
that 's right . 
they probably could n't do anything monetary , 
and i 'm not that familiar with them to know , 
i 'm not either really . 
that 's right . 
you know , 
that 's right . 
and most kids these days have gotten themselves into financial situations , where they have to be working all the time . 
that 's right . 
they need , young families , whatever , 
so , it 's a really tough question . 
that 's right . 
they just could n't take off to do that . 
that 's right , 
and that would upset a lot of people too , because they just want to get on , 
it sure would . 
it would have to be a lot of thought given to something like that , i would think . 
i think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program , 
but i think it ca n't be something that 's mandatory . 
it has to be something that 's voluntary which is pretty much the way it is now . 
that 's right . 
i 'm not even really sure at this point in time what programs are out there . 
and that 's the other thing is that instead of making it mandatory , they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better . and go to the schools and do programs , and tell them that we need your help , and volunteer for such and such a time , 
and you 've a choice of where you want to go . 
and handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it . 
in their own community , 
that 's true . 
most of them probably would n't do something like that . although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents . 
that 's right . 
that 's true too . 
that 's true too . 
but , they would have to be supported in some way , 
and i 'm not sure that those programs are available to do that . 
me neither . 
and , you wonder what kind of quality job would they do , 
just sit around for their year , 
or would they really make a contribution of some kind . 
it 's tough . 
it 's tough . 
it is tough . 
and i do n't know who 's even proposing it , or how they plan on implementing it , if they do . 
i 'm not sure either . 
but , i think , there would have to be a lot more information disseminated , before you say , let 's do this . 
i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them . 
it would take up more time than anything 
but it would n't take up a lot of money . 
they would n't have to spend money advertising and things like that . 
that 's right . 
you go to school 
and you have a kind of a captive audience , 
and you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something , 
but they do n't know where to go to do anything . 
that 's right . 
that 's a real waste too . 
it really is . 
it is . 
it really is . 
that was a big thing with him . 
i just do n't hear much about it anymore . 
like i say , i do n't even know what programs are even ongoing now . 
i do n't either . 
that 's one , 
anyway , it 's a tough question . 
it is a tough question . 
thanks for your time . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
same here . 
take care . 
you too . 
i , assume you have kids . 
we have one . 
she 's only nine months old . 
she does n't have to worry about public schools yet . 
my degree is in teaching , 
we have a little bit of a basis for conversation . 
i was a substitute teacher for about a year . 
i thought i wanted to be a teacher 
but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it . 
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided , not for me . 
did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels 
i just took grades one through six . 
i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids , 
wrong . 
my degree was in fourth through seventh grade 
but i taught junior high . 
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble 
but it was n't that bad , 
they call it something else . 
but , at the time that 's what i taught . 
and you kind of group your behavioral problems together 
but it was n't too bad . 
we got long real well . 
i sometimes wonder if i did n't mess up . 
i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least , if you have to you can get mean with them . 
those little kids do n't understand it . 
especially with the real young ones . 
i started out wanting to teach lower primary and then top primary and thought , i do n't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth 
and so that 's what i got my certification in . 
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to , if possible , teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools . 
and my reason for that was i do n't like the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools . 
that 's a nice way of putting it . 
you can find a lot of good public schools if you look real hard 
but i do n't think they could cover everything that you could teach , your children on an individual basis . 
and too , most people do n't have that option . 
i 've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy 
it does n't matter what you do . 
accept for the private ones , of course , 
we 're talking about public . 
i do n't know . 
back when i was going to school you just did n't get away with the things these kids get away with now . 
and this kid comes to school with his lunch box 
and i asked him what are you doing with that ? 
and he says , `` my father gave it to me . '' 
and i did n't believe it for a minute . 
not a lot i could do about it . 
ca n't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants . 
i 've , 
i think i understood what the kid was doing 
let 's just say he was one of those types that you would n't doubt that he was selling something . 
but not a lot i could do about it . 
and if we did have a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there . 
and you do n't know if you were reaching them or not 
but we felt like maybe just going ahead and trying to teach them was better than have them taken out . 
that does n't do a lot for them . 
but it does n't do anything for them . 
some of them were even better behaved . 
i 've only had two instances where it was really noticeable 
i do n't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on 
but it ended up better 
i do n't know , 
guns 
and , i do n't know 
it 's something . 
just teach the basics in schools 
it 's indicative across the board that we 've done something wrong . 
and here we are 
we ca n't balance a checkbook without a calculator . 
i do n't know . 
and i 've seen how their school system works 
they go by a complete rote system , 
so i do n't completely agree with that either . 
but there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere . 
that 's a great deal what law school 's like . 
is it ? 
is that what you ended up going into ? 
and i did the same sort of thing , 
you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases 
and then you get one examine for the whole semester 
and it 's how well you can remember it all . 
how much can you stuff in your brain . 
and i found that a particularly useless way of studying . 
i never did . 
and consequently some of the very best students had excellent memories 
but they could n't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned . 
it did n't show me anything . 
a year and a half , i gave it up . 
i did n't want to be a lawyer anyway , 
just wanted the degree . 
i do n't know . 
what can we do about it ? 
good question . 
money is not the answer . 
there 's plenty of money in the system , 
they 're throwing more money at it now than ever before 
and things are getting worse . 
i think it 's like a lot of things in the united states . 
we 've got so much built up in the , bureaucracy and in the politics of it , 
and in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again 
and there 's no way that , that can be done . 
not without wiping out a whole generation of kids in the school system , 
maybe on smaller scales . 
i do n't know 
as much as i did n't like school when i was going through it , from my perspective now i can see that it 's a lot better than what we have now . 
and i think part of it is that they 've got to give authority back to the local school . 
right into the classroom it needs to be able , to be enforced . 
teachers are so afraid now of even saying something , to students because they 're going to get complaints or they 're going to get sued or something . 
it 's like doctors in lawsuits , 
they 're kind of fearful of , everything . 
lawyers help create that . 
at least i 've heard that 
i think , what we 've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers 
we 're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day 
and he 's out of our hair . 
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents . 
it has to be reinforced in the home . 
you can have the best school system in the world 
if you do n't get anything at home then it 's not going to help either . 
so , i do n't know , 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know what the answer is . 
it 's an interesting thing you want to do . 
do they allow it ? 
they allow it under certain circumstances . 
you have to prove that you 're teaching them something . 
you have to follow , a preferred curriculum , 
they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum , although you do n't have to . 
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they 're kind of monitored . 
i ca n't think of any examples 
but certain religious groups do n't want their children in public schools because the influence . 
i do n't think they were in this area 
but they are monitored by the state school board . 
that 's interesting . 
i remembering reading a few cases about that when some people first tried that 
and they got sued . got taken to court by the school system . 
i 'm glad the parents won . 
that 's the way you got your education in this country . 
as a matter of fact this past weekend , since we had a long weekend , i took on a painting project in my bathroom 
and i had wallpaper up , 
and it took me all weekend 
because the wallpaper , getting it off , i had to wet the walls down 
and that had to dry . 
and then the painting took another day . 
i just painted . 
the wall behind the paper was smooth 
did you get good results ? 
not really . 
it looks so , bad 
i need to either paper back over it or do something . 
but it did n't cover it ? 
it covered the spots pretty good 
but it just did n't look as smooth as i wanted it to . 
we moved last august 
and we 're getting a house , 
my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den 
we went to one of the paint stores 
and they just said , you can get by , 
and i . 
more or less . 
after about , uh , half dozen coats it looks reasonable 
it was just a real dark wood grain type paneling 
and it was smooth 
and we put this stuff on 
but because of the dark behind it , it was really hard to cover 
it was something like that , 
although , when we got through i wished we had n't done it 
because we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it 
the job was considerably tougher than we thought . 
and they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate 
and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something . 
that 's an awful lot . 
have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted ? 
not inside . 
when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it . 
and it was fairly reasonable . 
we have a brick house 
if i remember right , it was like five hundred dollars . 
that 's quite reasonable . 
so that was n't too bad . 
have you tried matching paint lately ? 
i have n't . 
we built a shed over the long way , 
this is not on the topic 
but i did finish it . 
but my wife went to the home depot and took a piece of brick 
and she wanted to paint the shed 
it 's a wooden shed , 
and she took it 
and they 've got this machine that matches the color of paint . 
they mixed a gallon of it 
and it 's just remarkable how close it will match the paint , 
and it does it electronically . 
so , they did do a good job ? 
but it 's electronic . 
you put your sample under this thing 
and it 's really remarkable . 
and then they wanted some gray to do the trim . 
but . it 's remarkable . 
you want this to look like this 
and you want that to look like that 
and , of course , if it 's all white you 're all right 
have you had problems getting colors to match ? 
as a matter of fact what we 've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a blue 
and the blue , even two years later or so it does n't match , 
it 's the very same type of paint and everything , 
what 's the solution then ? 
i have no idea . 
i repainted the whole thing . 
at least you 'll get very good at it ? 
you could go back and paint , the whole thing over 
this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting 
i 'll just do a little bit here and a little there . 
we painted the house to , 
we painted the whole inside 
and it had all this dark trim . 
we did the one wall 
they do n't do that in the newer houses now 
the mold , everything is white . 
in a new house everything is white . 
white , 
that 's what we 're trying to get ours to look like . 
good luck . 
we wound up selling the house . 
it does , 
it 's interesting that the white makes the rooms look bigger . 
in our down stairs in our dining room it has molding like picture frames that are along the walls up a couple of feet . 
i see . 
and it makes the room look remarkably smaller . 
the trim , is still white . 
the molding 
white . 
and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive , 
it explains why they have everything white 
what about the lighting ? 
did it make a big difference ? 
not particularly 
because the house has so many windows 
the living room has four good size windows 
and of course , at night 
we have a soccer field that 's about a hundred yards from our house 
and the lights shine right at our house . 
we did n't know that when we bought the house 
the color does n't really matter because you have that light . 
we have a lot of light , 
and i think it 's just the dark blue to about three feet 
and then above that we left it white 
so . it did n't change 
i see . 
but the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away 
you have to do that very , very carefully . 
and it takes a long time , 
that 's right . 
you can work yourself to death . 
i 'm sorry to hear your color did n't come out so good over the weekend . 
it 's kind of frustrating . 
it is . 
a lot of work , 
a lot of work . 
i 've got to go to a meeting . 
it 's been good talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
i do n't know . 
i grew up in the sixties , 
and at that time it was a changing time for the whole music scene , i guess 
i have kind of gone back to more of a county flavor in music . 
i 'm not quite sure why that is 
and it seems like almost a opposite , 
but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot sounding music . 
it did n't have what i was looking for 
at the time country tells more of a story . 
it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up 
and i 've become more of a country fan over the years . 
when you say that you grew up in the sixties i take it that was the teenage type years 
that was my teenage years . 
we 're very similarly aged , 
so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times , 
so i 'm just a couple years older than you , 
essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that for one reason or another i did n't pay much attention to music , 
and i became attached to that style of urban country if there is such a thing , 
over time i became very interested in baroque classical 
and i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it very relaxing for me . 
it 's something that interests me combined with the classical tastes i had mentioned . 
i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music . 
that 's kind of the way i am . 
i listen to some country and western 
and i 've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it . 
i played a little bit of piano . 
i continue to do that . 
i want to do it 
and i never have the discipline to stay with it , 
it 's got basically an easy rhythm and tone . 
and it 's easily something to fall into . 
i 'm kind of the say way , 
i 've gone through different periods of life in music from pop to classical . 
i was influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that 's where i worked . 
and i 've developed a real love for classical music in , probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was heavy into classical type music . 
and so consequently we wound up playing a lot of classical music there 
and i think that got deep seated into me . 
one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is are those that call on those classical roots , i guess , 
for some reason there 's not a whole lot of his stuff that i 'm real crazy about , 
but he does have some things . 
and i think even electric light orchestra had some real influences by classical music 
i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music . 
i do n't know which is chicken and egg in that situation . 
and i found that i really like china beach 
and i particularly like tour of duty 
and , thirty something i 'm particularly interested , 
but it 's the music , almost that i find myself listening to , 
that could well be . 
i think the title of it was just downtown , 
and if you recall how it goes downtown , 
all i have to do is hear that song 
that 's their signal . 
they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it , 
that 's right . 
when did you first take your first piano lesson ? 
probably about first grade , 
and i have returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to do something about it . 
i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes 
and then inevitably i am swept away by the pressure of other types of things , 
it is a time consumer . 
it is . 
i always think that i 'll be able to do it 
keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them . 
i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what 's involved , 
and i keep thinking , i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand 
but it does n't for me . 
it 's making that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it . 
i was never able to master all that . 
they went through the parent thing where you 've got to practice or you 're not going out to play , 
and when it came to my turn the folks said we 're not going through that again , 
they sold the piano , 
and turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to , 
that 's one of things i felt like i missed in life 
i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that , 
i 'm kind of like you , 
maybe one of these days i 'll get around to it , 
i 'll do something with the piano , 
but probably not . 
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance , 
just never got a chance to come out . 
that 's the most fascinating thing . 
it 's a pleasure talking with you . 
best , of luck in your graduate school . 
take care . 
you take this subject much more personally than i do , i suppose . 
take it back , thirty years 
i 'm going back too far , from my parents ' generation when mom stayed home , period 
if you were educated you might teach for a year or two before you got married . 
and if you really pushed it , you taught until you had kids or something , 
if you were a teacher . then that was it , until the kids were little . 
you were n't supposed to want a job . 
there 's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day . 
and then of course today it 's supposed to be all the other way . 
you 're supposed to only want the job , 
and , your kids should be totally happy in day care , because everybody else goes to day care 
and we have these wonderful people who are totally prepared to teach your child everything they need to know in day care 
but , a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you 're going to make at the job . 
and we 'll see how the generations go . 
at least for a lot of women depending on what she did . 
and i did it for six years 
and for one , 
i had one while i was pregnant , 
and then one while my oldest was a year old , 
and it just drove me crazy . 
so it was you and the kid 
that 's the thing , 
maybe if you get along 
for example if you 'd been a technician instead of an engineer . 
the technicians work the eight to five job and know when they 're going to be there . 
might have been better . 
but if you 're going to be more professional oriented , then , to be able to perform well on the job you 've got to have the flexibility that does n't really go with the family . 
in my case , i just decided that , as long as my kids were little , i would be better off at home with them , instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once . 
so you figure one of these days you 're going to go back to being an engineer ? 
is that what you 're saying ? 
actually i 've found out that i 'm not going to go back to being an engineer . 
you 've found something else . 
i have branched out . 
and i 'm very mechanical , 
and mechanical engineering interested me , 
so i did that . 
and then i did that for six years . 
and then i stayed home with my son , and did nothing . and found out that it was great , 
but i was bored part of the time , too . 
and i wanted something else to do , 
you figure there 's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child . 
it 's great while they 're really little , 
he goes to a mother 's day out program now once a week . 
both of my kids do , 
and they need that to be able to relate to other people besides the same person every day . 
i think they do , too . 
and i need it for the break . 
that 's the other thing , 
they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work , 
still taking care of the children is a very important job . 
and someone 's got to do it , and be able to do it right , 
and if it 's not mom then dad or somebody 's got to move in there and do the job , because the kids really need it . 
and enjoy it , 
that 's the whole thing . 
i think that 's the thing that we 're going to see , 
i think the biggest thing we 're going to see coming up in the next ten year is that there 's going to be a lot of women , 
and they 're going to have to work it out to working part time . 
because , i liked my job really well . 
but i was just pulled in so many different directions 
it was just driving me crazy . 
and now , with the photography , it 's working , 
the thing that i 'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mother 's day out programs , and also soccer teams , and different stuff like that . 
so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week , 
or my husband when he 's at home , can take care of them . 
so jobs have to become more flexible . 
i think they 're really going to have to , 
and not just for mothers , for fathers as well . 
it 's going to have to be both . 
so that 's another thing that has to adapt is the father 's attitudes about whose job is this . 
it 's his job too . 
to me the only important issue is the children , 
because as far as housework goes men can do housework just as easily as women , 
and thanks to a lot of new inventions , housework does n't take as much time as it used to . 
it 's just convincing your husband that that 's important , or that it 's important enough for him to do it . 
because if he saw mom doing only that all the time he was growing up then it 's hard to think of it that i should do it or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it . 
you talk , 
i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help , and even though we were both working the same number of hours , and doing things , i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done , 
this is what you do it now . 
and i agree , 
but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him 
and that 's a very hard attitude to change . 
and it 's just they do n't look at things . 
and i think most women walk in and with , oh , got to clean all this up . got to get this out and this in and this taken care of , instead of having someone say this is the time this needs to be done , 
and a lot of that is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid . 
which brings us back to the idea someone 's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in the right ideas to , so that they know that male and female are both responsible for doing this 
that 's right . 
and i think that 's going to show up a lot more now , in the next generation of boys and girls . 
the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done , because mom was there saying that dad is there , 
they were both working at whatever things needed to be done . 
they 're going to say to the kids you need do this , because it needs to be done not because it 's a woman 's job or a man 's job , but because it 's dirty and it needs to be clean . 
but i think in between we got a generation of kids who did n't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad did n't move in to fill the gap . 
and so , basically no one was taking the responsibility 
and i think that 's happened in a lot of cases . 
some kids are really having it . 
some time day care is really good , 
it 's someone keeping an eye on the kids 
but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any relationship with the adults to say here 's what 's right 
and here 's what , 
and here 's what we expect of you . 
i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit , was because i wanted my kids to have my values , 
this is the way i feel about this , 
if you teach them when they 're little the way you want them to be , and the things that are important to you , then you add onto it as they get older . 
but if no one does anything when they 're little , then it 's twice as hard as they get older . 
i 'm saying this as i 'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something . 
i understand , 
i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls . 
she 's usually in bed by this time , 
but she 's staying up late tonight . 
i want to have a relationship with her . 
my dad was a very traditional dad , 
and when i was a child i did n't really know my dad very well , 
and i miss that . 
that 's the thing , 
like we said , if women 's roles change drastically , men 's roles will , too . 
but men have to be convinced of that . 
and a lot of it 's for the better . 
some of the women 's roles are almost for the worse , because we 're losing out on some things , going back to work , 
i know mine almost never did ... 
how about you . 
constantly . 
you and me both . 
it seems everything i do is computer related . 
and if it goes down , then we 're stuck all day . 
but that 's pretty much everything i 've worked with 
and i 've become so accustomed to it that it 's second nature . 
what do you use ? 
it 's kind of getting too slow for me , 
so i audit computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level . 
and i use my personal computer constantly , 
but i 'm getting , not only our local area network , 
but i 'm getting two separate mainframe machines , also . 
and every now and then the file gets so big , that it moves slower than i 'd like 
and i do n't know , 
i enjoy working with them . 
there 's so many capabilities out there , 
the things you can do are endless . 
and one of the three of us has an accounting background 
so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they 're doing 
and i 'm the administrator for our local area network . 
and i need to keep that going 
i do n't have one at home , 
we have one at home , 
but i just do n't find the time that i can use it . 
right now i would rather not have one at home , because i would work at home . 
if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night . 
so they did n't know how it was going to work , 
but it 's almost like we could become too dependent on them . 
what 's the word i 'm looking for , 
i 'm just totally drawing a blank . 
it 's remarkable the things we can do now , and compared to . 
just the power , 
i 'm trying to get an updated machine . 
mine is just putting along . 
but i do n't know if my boss will spring for it . 
we think about that a lot . 
that 's what i do . 
that 's awful . 
it 's not a real elaborate local area network , 
but we can share the printer 
and we can send files to each other , 
and we can send mail messages to each other , which is good enough , 
it 's what we need . 
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it . 
but once he bought it , he has been so pleased . 
it 's fast , 
it has good copy . 
the copy that you can . 
and i can use either the pro printer 
i can just print it in my office . 
we 're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer . 
the budget restraints and things like that , makes it difficult 
they have gotten really cheap . 
but the quality is almost laser quality . 
and i think it 's called the desk jet 
and i think they 're about five hundred dollars now . 
and we got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars . 
i do n't remember what kind they were , 
sometimes the color would take too long to plot out . 
so they just want black and white , which we can just run them through the laser printer real quick . because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it . 
so that 's all you need for charts and stuff . 
you do n't need them in four colors . 
if it was a customer presentation then that would be different . 
we have one in the office 
and in our area , if we want to use it , like you said , you had to change it , put it on a disc , and carry it over to there , and see if they 're not using the printer , 
you use the system . 
and wait for an opportunity to use it . 
you 'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer . 
until they got off the machine . 
i know , 
i know , 
i understand . 
i was amazed when i came to work , 
it 's part of the bank holding company 
any way , i work in a big prestigious place . 
i was going wait a minute . 
come on guys , 
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you 're behind the times in technology . 
we 're pushing real hard though . 
we 're trying , 
the entire bank is not like that . 
the bank philosophy is one of innovation and , lead the market . 
it 's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the senior vice president , over audits , is cheap . 
but i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better 
how are we supposed to present the imagine that we 're supposed to present with equipment that 's outdated , that 's obsolete 
and some of the guys that run this place are very tight 
and it 's why do we need this , 
ca n't you do that with what we have , 
unfortunately , the , computer equipment and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly , 
do you want to go first ? 
fitness and exercise . 
why do n't you go first . 
i like to do weight training and cycling . and just walking swimming . 
and the doctor said that running and jumping is n't real good for my knee anymore , 
so i had to kind of change my life-style a little bit . 
let me ask a personal question , 
how old are you ? 
the rest of me is in pretty good shape 
it 's just that left knee that just does n't want to do everything it used to . 
you 're lucky then 
even since i was about two or three . 
then they diagnosed it , 
and usually most people are just absolutely crippled , 
and i do water aerobics . 
religiously do water aerobics , 
i bet that helps . 
i used to do it about six times a week 
and now i 'm down to about four 
i tried weight training 
and i 'm telling you , i just ca n't lift the things . 
and the shock on the system is just too much , 
but it 's hard to find . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
so , i 've considered even becoming licensed to teach it . 
if you know what your routine is , you can do that by yourself , 
and you probably do . 
but you have to have an indoor pool . 
this is true . 
you look very odd in the water , 
that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training , 
and that does look very odd in the water . 
i can believe that . 
and that 's the only place i have n't tried 
and people have told me . 
i have been told that thing is just lovely . 
it is . 
do you use that facility a lot ? 
a fairly good amount 
more on the weekends , 
i try to beat the traffic in the mornings 
do you know if they have child care there ? 
have you done your attitude survey for this year yet ? 
you need to put that on there , seriously . 
you do n't ? 
as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position 
actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry , 
and i used to fill out those attitude surveys , 
and me and the insurance adjusters are very familiar with each other 
and my husband still works there , 
and i get my attitude expressed through them , 
sometimes it 's kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks . 
this is true . 
and i came down here 
and they did an attitude survey six weeks after i had been working here 
and i asked about day care for the shift workers , 
and i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just do n't say that , 
it was not applicable to me 
what year are we talking about ? 
things have become much more enlightened since then . 
they could n't have gotten anymore in the dark ages . 
we still do n't have a day care facility 
but people are more sympathetic to it . 
and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was . 
i had been rated number one in the field 
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home , 
could you hold the phone for one second , 
i 'm back . 
and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one , because that 's when i go into labor four and a half months 
and i do n't even know it . 
of course it 's real easy to take care of the first one when you 're on your back . 
very easy , 
very easy 
and after the baby was born , since it was n't premature , then they said they would n't cover the cost of the monitor . 
but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work , 
and i 'll tell you how they handled this 
and i was just outraged , 
i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later 
and they did n't have any coverage under my name 
and i went back 
and i said what the hell is going on here . 
and they told me your husband works here 
and he 's got a good salary 
we did n't think that you 'd be coming back anyway , 
and we 've got people here that really need to be working 
and we 'd just let you go . 
and it took me about a year of arguing , 
i said i 've got to put this in writing to me , because until they put it in writing , i could n't get my insurance benefits 
and i could n't get my termination benefits either . 
there you go . 
i can believe that . 
but i guess things have gotten better , 
i still do n't think after my experiences that they could get me to go back , ever again . 
i can understand . 
i can understand . 
it 's been good talking with you . 
how much is it a month ? 
it 's only about ten bucks a month . 
that 's for individual . 
to add dependents is maybe another dollar or something 
it 's no big deal . 
that 's it ? 
if you pay your monthly charge , do you then pay separately for classes you 're taking ? 
you do for classes , 
but to use any of the facilities is no extra charge . 
that 's cheap . 
it is . 
that 's really cheap . 
or a dependent of one . 
i am so dependent these days . 
so my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment 
i really think i am , 
that beats any offer i 've heard in a long time . 
it 's great . 
when you 're there on weekends is it crowded as hell ? 
it would depend on when you go 
it 's not excessively crowded on the weekends . 
i 'd want to be there in the mornings from nine thirty to ten thirty . 
i do n't think that would be bad at all . 
then you could go either one , 
and you 'd probably like the pool there . 
it sounds like i would . 
i might do that then . 
i learned something here . 
i 'm glad . 
you can go back to work now . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
you have a good day . 
in a normal route of way we do things , how about the ladies go first ? 
i have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year , 
so i 'm really just starting to get involved in what 's out there and how they do things . 
as far as the system as a whole , i really do n't see a problem with it . 
and i think that 's the main problem at this point . 
how about yourself ? 
when you take professionals and put them in situations , they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education , 
and they ca n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to get that major subject in line , 
something 's wrong . 
they 're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for how the level of education should be for children . 
i have a one year old 
that 's true . 
i have a real issue with that . 
i have a real concern about that , 
so i think there 's a big concern 
hopefully the new secretary of education will do something to fix the problem 
but i do n't know , 
i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that special interest groups can blow up and not really get down to teaching what 's important . 
teaching these kids really the basics is what it comes down to . 
is that right ? 
, the kids nowadays do n't even know what the president 's fitness education program is all about , 
i remember . 
and 
and she said that she had a choice , 
she could either have taken tennis , or weight lifting 
give me a break , 
the kids sit there 
and , then go out there and lift weights and do n't learn anything , 
and talk , 
i have a real problem with the whole system . 
then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public service , employees that there are , 
and yet they 're so important . 
i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she was paid . 
she was young , 
but still it 's the principle . 
of course , if she got her master 's degree it would all be different . 
it 's hard though because then you start talking taxes 
and , that 's a bad word . 
we might have us a problem . 
there 's an idea . 
maybe i should run for office ? . 
that 's true . 
that 's funny , 
that 's funny . 
that 's about all i have here . 
me , too , 
i think we both agree there 's some problems there 
but , we 'll , maybe do our small part to fix them up . 
i 've enjoyed it . 
you too . 
where do you get most of your news ? 
and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends . 
where are you ? 
i get my news from a combination of sources . 
i take the paper every day 
and actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work . 
and then usually over lunch , there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news . 
i normally find that i 'm probably the most news hungry of my friends , 
so we do n't normally talk about the news at lunch . 
i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend , simply because i used to get it during the week 
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend , plus after work . 
and i enjoy that quite a bit . 
so here lately with all the middle eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch . 
he 's very , very skeptical of the news media , 
and i will admit i 'm reasonably skeptical also . 
but he 's much more so . 
i suppose it 's a different attitude that we normally do n't hear in the country . 
true 
they tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story . 
they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time . 
i guess they only normally stick with just the one story . 
but they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories . 
they do n't report on every murder and shooting that happened in every little town . 
it 's very much national interest news . 
a lot of times they end up with these panels of experts 
and they go back and forth , where everyone 's giving some opinions 
i 've been getting a kick out of those lately . 
so i 've never actually been through a period of war 
and i do n't know anyone in the military 
when they started to speculate , i saw that for what is was , and thought all of these guys do n't know what 's going on . 
but i thought they were interesting , 
and they shed some light on what was going on for me . 
i will admit it 's interesting . 
so i do n't have any more experience in that than you . 
there were some that were screaming for air power , 
there were some that were saying the air power was n't going to do it . 
and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world , which i suppose just about everyone does , 
but these guys had a , national soap box to stand on and express this view . 
and it was for children 
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio , 
and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions . 
they had them all , on line . 
they had them all on hold 
and that person would answer the question . 
it was just very informative and interesting , 
and i was real impressed at how a b c handled translating , the war for children . 
this is getting a little off the topic , 
i thought that was a really unusual thing . 
i do n't know if they still have them , 
but they were free rental , videos , that had something to do with the war . 
with the children 's aspect ? 
it was something for children , that they had several advertisements on television pushing parents . 
i suppose that is a valuable service . 
again not having lived through another war , i do n't know if that 's a common thing that people thought of , or if that was a new concern with people . 
that type of technology just was n't at people 's disposal . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
so i do n't think there 's ever been a war that 's been so thoroughly covered by the news . 
and probably more importantly , one that lasted short enough that people 's interest did n't flag too badly . 
i tell you what , 
the first three days , i was glued to the television . 
i will admit the same thing . 
and they would run these extended two , three hour versions of the program 
i tell you what . 
let 's see , 
and the people would be standing there in gas masks , 
and you 'd be hearing the sirens , 
i was amazed . 
i did n't have that experience . 
i do n't have cable 
i 've got one question for you . 
you say you take the newspaper . 
we 've got the one relatively weaker paper , the times herald , and then the morning news , which has a very strong subscription . 
do you have just one paper , 
or do you have several ? 
there are two , 
and they 're pretty close . 
and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck , 
and the other one has some weird ones that i 've never heard of . 
i actually take both newspapers on the weekends . 
do you ? 
i figure i 'm only taking on the weekend , 
and i can afford that . 
i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better , 
and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial outlook . 
i get the times herald just to balance that out a little bit . 
i guess he takes seven , 
so he 's getting all the sports sections . 
i guess this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do hand work . 
what kinds of things have you done ? 
i 've made a lot of baby gifts . 
do you ever keep any of your stuff ? 
is n't that funny . 
and i have very little of my own stuff , 
and it 's kind of embarrassing . 
people say let me see some of your work . 
can you do it ? 
is n't that funny . 
i guess i do have one thing . 
a friend of mine gave me a clock kit 
and i kept that because she gave me that . 
that would be definitely something you 'd want to keep . 
and it 's real neat . 
was the whole face done or just the numbers , and minute marks ? 
i guess the minute marks , 
they 're like hearts . 
at the numbers they 're kind of outlined and stuff . 
it was quite bit of work , 
but it was a lot of fun , too . 
i really like doing stuff like that . 
what 's that ? 
i started to say the canvas , 
what kind of cloth uses that . 
i 've just gone blank . 
but it 's used with yarn , 
and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth 
that 's interesting . 
what kind of things did you do ? 
what i did , when i was doing that was mostly pillows for sofas and so forth , 
and i ca n't find one that i 've done . 
it 's one of those things 
i did n't give them away , 
but i did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves or what , 
i was so proud of them when i got them finished , 
but i have no idea where they are . 
what did you call that ? 
i 've never heard of that before . 
i 've probably seen it , though , 
i suspect you have . 
when you described it , it sounded like something that would be around , i guess . 
but , i 've never heard of it before , 
and it 's really interesting . 
i guess i 've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past , 
but i 've kind of gotten out of that . 
i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows . 
me , too . 
that 's interesting . 
it is . 
how did you know to choose this subject , tonight . 
that 's funny . 
so many of them now have the ribbons where , i 'm not sure how they do it , 
i do n't know how to explain it . 
they make them hard ? 
i 've never done that , 
and those are so neat . 
i would really like to do those 
i 've seen some , 
i suspect they 're fairly simple , because the one lady i 've seen , i know that does it , i 've never asked her any questions , 
but she has three kids all under the age of six . 
and they 're all a handful . 
so it 's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly . 
it 's like white glue , 
i do n't know . 
i think that 's what my concern was , was it really sure , and how they would last . 
do you know what my concern is ? 
how will i dust this thing ? 
you 're right . 
that 's terrible . 
that 's true . 
that 's funny . 
it 's a flag , 
and i do n't want to wash it , because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth , 
but it 's such a dust collector to be out , and so forth . 
and most of my things are dust collectors . 
and i hate to dust . 
i know . 
so first thing i think of is how easy would this , thing be to clean . 
that 's funny . 
i have really gotten out of it . 
i do n't do it quite as much as i used to . because i went back to school , 
so i do n't have as much time . 
you do n't have time . 
and i have two children also . 
you definitely do n't have time . 
it keeps me very busy . 
but i really enjoy it when i do do it , when i get the chance . 
it 's so relaxing to just sit , 
but once i get started , i ca n't put it down . 
i have a similar problem . 
i 've got to have time 
or i do n't even want to get into it in the first place . 
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all . 
i know , 
that 's what i keep telling this person , 
i did n't tell you what year . 
what was this project ? 
and it 's a picture , 
and it 's a wildlife , 
it has deer and trees 
and , it 's really beautiful , 
but it 's going to be a lot of work , 
and i have worked on it quite a bit , but not as much as i 'd like to . 
it 's just so hard . 
and so since it 's counted it 's really a lot of work . 
i do know . 
i have done a little bit of that , 
but i decided that that 's something that demands my total attention . 
and so i 've got to have almost total silence . 
i ca n't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate . 
it does not sound like an easy one to finish . 
it really is n't , 
and i tell you , 
i could just kick myself for even starting it , because i have a feeling i 'm never going to get it done . 
i 'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life . 
i 'm sure you 'll get it done , 
but it just may not , 
obviously not of the original time schedule . 
that 's true . 
it just seems like there 's just never enough time to pick it up and do it , , 
it 's just really hard . 
like i said i really enjoy it when i do . 
it 's just hard . 
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated . 
and there 's so many other things that , i have done in the meantime , like i said , so many baby gifts . 
and so those do n't take much time at all . 
so it 's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them . 
do you use a book of patterns , 
i usually just buy a pattern book . 
i have several pattern books , 
and i just go with those . 
usually i think it 's a little bit cheaper in the long run , 
and then i just use whatever colors i want to . 
i do n't usually use the colors they tell me to . 
and it depends on what it is . 
but some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , i just go with whatever i want to . 
that 's what i would do , too . 
or whatever i have . 
there 's a few designs i guess i 've done myself , but not very many . 
real simple ones i do . 
i made a little thumb print and made it a bunny . 
it was really easy . 
just did a thumb print . 
what . with ink ? 
that was just the ink , 
and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth . 
that was so simple . 
that sounds really neat . 
it did n't take anything at all . 
did you use , a stamp pad and ink . 
just like being finger printed ... 
let 's see . 
how do you feel about credit cards ? 
personally , i do not care for them . although i find them a necessity in business and so forth , 
i try to refrain from their use as much as possible . for a number of reasons , one of which is the extreme interest rate on most of them . 
and i 'm not terribly in favor of them . 
not for my own personal point of view . 
plus from an economic point of view it has increased our debt tremendously to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion , i believe 
at least that 's one number for this range of numbers i have heard . 
do you use them frequently 
me and my wife , when we have extra money that we know we 're going to have , and we can put it in our budget we 'll use it . 
i think it was twenty something cents interest , on our visa . 
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period . 
so we 'll pay a little interest this year , but maybe two dollars . 
but we do n't like to do that at all . 
and i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly . 
we have several credit cards , though . 
and i think we have a couple of department stores . 
but , we use it the same way , 
it 's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill . 
that 's usually how we do it . 
i 'd sent them several hundred dollars , or whatever i felt i would spend . and then use it then . 
but for hotels and so forth . 
but i knew that it was paid . 
i knew that i had that much credit , going in . 
sometimes i would go over , 
but it would n't hit me in a big way because i knew that i would have it covered in that respect . 
that 's good . 
i do n't think we 've gone that far to pay it in advance before we spend it , 
plus when they would send the bill , they would automatically convert to the exchange rate . 
so the only time that got to be a problem was , if the exchange rate changed drastically . 
and when i finally got over there , it had fallen two or three francs to the dollar . 
so , i got caught a little short in that regard , 
maybe it would be more than that . 
especially , 
that was the only time i really got caught short . 
but as i said , most of all i try not to use them lavishly , in that regard . 
that 's good . 
from where are you calling ? 
i know him very well . 
i 've known jack for a long time , 
and i 'm also in the speech business . 
so , when i heard that jack was going to do this , i called him and asked for an application where i could participate in this . 
and , so that 's how i got involved . 
what 's the word . 
your speech is very exact . 
. thank you very much . 
but , as jack said , i 'm one of the old hands in the speech business . 
i 've been doing it for twenty some odd years . 
i work in . 
i guess we 're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording . 
i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject , 
so , i think you get ten , 
so i think we 're okay . 
you have a good evening . 
you too . 
it 's been pleasant talking to you . 
same here . 
take care . 
how are you today ? 
i 'm great . 
do you have one ? 
i do n't have one at home . 
i work with one at work continually , 
but i do not have one of my own at home . 
what do you have , at home ? 
it 's probably pretty close to what i have , because i have the same kind of thing at work . 
that 's what we have . . 
do you use it a lot at home ? 
i really do . 
i am an accountant 
but i work at home . 
so you 're on it a lot . 
so i use it for that quite often . 
we have used some of it for some personal things . 
we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it . 
since it 's tax season , i 'm doing a lot of taxes , 
so i do a lot of that work on it as well . 
i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person 
and she works out of her home also . 
and the software that does the taxes is just incredible . 
it is . 
i expected to go and drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later . 
you can . 
it was great . 
you can , 
that 's right . 
that 's wonderful . 
i have often thought that having one at home would be neat . 
i just do n't know if we would really use it that much . 
we did n't decide to get one until i started working at home . 
then , we thought , we can use it for some personal things . 
for us it really took a business application to justify the expense of it . 
and it 's got some stuff on it . 
it 's got a nice little word processing software on it and some budgeting type things and stuff . 
and i do n't think she 's ever touched it . 
it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home . 
she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer . 
she could just as easily do those things by hand . 
just as quickly . 
i know my boss has bought the software that his checkbook is on a disk , 
and he goes in and types his checks on the screen and then hits print , 
and they print out on the checks , 
and he 's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places , 
i saw him yesterday morning over there , 
and he paid his monthly bills , 
and he just wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print 
and it printed out like ten checks , 
they 're perforated , 
and he just ripped them off . 
they go through just a continuous thing on the printer 
and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes 
and there they went . 
and he said i can balance my checkbook in seconds because it 's all in the computer . 
and there 's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make . 
that 's exactly why . 
he said , used to be i always sat looking for those . 
he said this way there is n't any . 
it does it for you . 
there are definitely , some advantages to it . 
it 's just a matter of , like you say , does it justify the cost , if you 're using it strictly for personal business . 
i think in most cases i 'd have to say no . 
not unless somebody really enjoys it . or perhaps is using it for education . 
i have a four year old son , 
and we have some education programs that he likes . 
and we have another one that plays music , 
and he really likes that one . 
as he grows up he 'll be even more and more too . 
that 's right . 
that 'll be great . 
and 
my sister went to college , started about three years ago , 
and she had to have a computer . 
it was a necessity . 
she could n't imagine going through college without a computer . 
i 'm going through right now . 
everything has to be typed . 
they require it . 
so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home if you were going to school . 
any more i do n't even know if a college kid would have a typewriter . 
i do n't know . 
probably not even , 
and they probably used to have it . 
i just finished a major research paper a couple of weeks ago , 
and i could n't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it . 
unfortunately in our family , my husband and i went through college together 
and then he went on and got his master 's degree while i was working . 
and we just had a regular old typewriter , not even a correcting one back then . 
and you had to type all of his papers . 
it was n't that long ago , 
but i typed his master 's papers and things on a typewriter . 
to have a computer back then . 
cut your time in half at least . 
at least . 
at least . 
and then of course you have some changes to make , and do the whole thing over . 
you take out a sentence , 
on a computer you take it out print it out , 
take out a sentence on a piece of paper , 
you do the whole thing over . 
that 's right . 
i remember when i was working in high school , 
i was working in an office , right after i got out of high school 
i continued working there for probably another year . 
and we did everything on a typewriter everything . 
but it 's amazing , 
then , when , someone would have you type a letter , they did it right . 
the first time . 
they sit there 
and they go , is this really what i want to say , 
and you typed it 
and that was it , 
and now people just send it back over and over and over and over . 
we 'll try this out and see what it looks like . 
but it gets a little out of hand sometimes . 
i 've seen it get out of hand up here where we 've got a secretary that sits over here that 's keeping metrics right now , and keeping up of all the letters i type , how many of them do i make changes on . and on each letter , what types of changes . 
are they because i could n't read it 
or people just change one word because they think it sounds better , or whatever . 
i believe it . 
and it 's ridiculous 
and that was the high week , 
it 's good that she does that bring it to people 's attention . 
that 's exactly right . 
she keeps several weeks ' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show look , this did n't really need to be changed . 
this is ridiculous 
and changing , add this time to now . 
that 's the kind of things that she 's keeping and showing , that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it was a waste to change something like that . 
. anyway , maybe it 'll help in some way , 
but i do n't know . 
there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative . 
without a doubt . 
without a doubt . 
i would like to get one at home some day . 
we 've got a two year old son , 
and so some day i would like to get , even just the video or something like that , 
just to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful . 
especially when they 're in school , i think they would get a lot out of it . 
i do too , 
i do too . 
that sounds like such a great idea , 
it 'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it . 
and when we were in high school it was always fun . 
we could link in , 
and i do n't even remember now what it was called . 
but you could link in and talk to people all over the country . 
and you have your own little code name , 
and you 'd type in how are you , 
and they 'd type back and everybody , 
and you 'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time , 
and it was just great fun , 
it was very expensive , because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance . 
it was like a long distance phone call . 
so , we were each limited to twenty minutes a day , 
that still could add up . 
it added up big . 
my parents were divorced 
and so the time we were visiting our father in the summer time , 
i 'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations . 
but when you 're doing the guilty father complex , because he 's not there to watch us grow , you can kind of get all kinds of stuff . 
that 's sad . 
it was nice to talk to you . 
you too . 
have a nice day . 
you too . 
movies . 
i have n't seen too many lately . 
i have kids 
and we went and saw the rescuers down under , over the break . 
do you have kids you take to movies 
no kids . 
and got all kinds of academy awards and things last year . 
but this one was excellent . 
and i ca n't believe how good they 're getting with their animation now . 
it 's just the special effects . 
and in this movie , there 's this boy 
and the boy actually rides on his back 
and he rides through the clouds , 
and you see him coming out of the clouds , his head coming out and then the bird coming out , 
and they 're flying all over with it . 
and i know there must have been computers or something for animation this day , 
it was a good show . 
that 's not a recent movie , 
but i enjoyed that show . 
that was made several years back . 
but the plot was bland , 
the acting was bland . 
chop them up ? 
chop them up , 
and all of them could be in that fashion , or category . 
it was about a , french foreign legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother 's wife who became a widow because he was selling drugs , 
and he got killed . 
and he starts out by fighting to make money , 
and then he moves on to l a to where she is to just help him out . 
i do n't know . 
i had n't heard much about that movie . 
other than it was a chop them up movie . 
but i guess that 's one i wo n't go see . 
it was worth the buck i guess . 
you went to the dollar movie ? 
they show up at the dollar movie right after they come out . 
they 're usually not that great or did n't do that great anyway . 
let me see . 
let me see 
another movie i watched . 
i have n't seen that . 
have you seen that one yet ? 
i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting . 
and the music 
and it had an excellent story line . 
everything about it was good . 
but that was a well directed and acted movie . 
is that right ? 
i 'd recommend it . 
it 's a little on the violent side 
but then what movie is n't anymore . 
and , seems like the rating system is kind of switching that way a little bit . 
i have no objections to it . 
and it 's a matter of your taste , 
they just changed it because x had a connotation with it , 
and even on those type they do n't show what you expect . 
a lot of those are really violent type movies . 
that seems to be the norm of most movies , 
let me see . 
have you seen that one ? 
i have . 
that was pretty good . 
i read the book before 
so i knew the story line going in , 
but they changed some things in the movie . 
it was n't the same . 
i thought the book was better than the movie , 
but i thought the movie was really good as well . 
i always wait for the movie . 
i do n't have time to read the book . 
i do n't , 
i read about one or two thick novels like that a year , 
that 's about all the time i can spare . 
but that was a good show i thought . 
i read an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine . 
that was n't a real submarine you saw in the water . 
all those underwater scenes . 
it looked to me like it was a real submarine , that was in the water . 
i hear this movie f x part two coming out is pretty good . 
is that right ? 
did you ever see the original one ? 
i did n't . 
you ought to rent the f x part one . 
it does n't say part one , 
but it 's f slash x . 
. what 's that about ? 
i 'm not sure . 
i ca n't remember . 
it 's been a while since i 've seen it . 
but he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody 
and he has to go underground , 
and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done . 
to fool people 
and using makeup and using all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go . 
all the tricks . 
that sounds like an interesting concept . 
but you need to rent the first one first . 
to understand what 's going on in the second ? 
if that is that the second one follows the first . 
i do n't know if they have the original actors on that first one to that one . 
they 're supposed to be coming out with all these desert storm movies , this summer , too . 
i expected those . 
they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there , i think . 
actual names , will not be used . 
eventually they will come out with the proper names . 
it , 
i guess they 'll probably come out with a lot of movies . 
it was such a rout though . 
i do n't know , 
latest story , 
is that right ? 
i do n't know . 
that 's just one of the many rumors that floats around . 
or what you read . 
pretty much used up the tape . 
it 's been about five minutes . 
it 's been nice talking with you . 
same . 
and we 'll talk to you on the next go around . 
keep on watching those movies ? 
first of all , i want to tell you i have two little kids , 
but they 're not in public school yet . 
so you have n't really dealt with that in a sense . 
but being one of these late in life mothers , i 've listened to everybody else 's complaints as to what 's the matter with either their kids or the school system . 
so i 've been surprised . 
do you have school age kids ? 
mine are both out of school . 
such as ? 
just over the years there were situations that came up that i did n't think were fair or handled correctly 
or the teachers did n't seem to be teaching anything . 
of course , it 's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child . 
they bring things home 
and i was never one to believe everything my kids said about something . 
and yet others i know are just wonderful . 
i heard a frightening thing . 
actually , i did n't hear it . 
and there 's always going to be somebody having a need for a math or science teacher . 
this would be frightening . 
i do n't know anything about it . 
that 's pretty interesting because , just because you know a subject matter does n't mean you can teach it . 
and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter , i do n't know if i 'd know how to handle that kind of a group of kids . 
in fact , i think that 's one of the big problems today is the way the kids behave or act and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what 's going on in the class and disruptive . 
i tell you what i 'm finding frightening 
so i went through this period of supposedly cosmic social enlightenment . 
and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school . 
and i used to think , that 's wonderful . 
they can get a real life experience . 
and they 're in the same classrooms . 
i think it would be next year is what i 'd read . 
i thought , how do you weed those out ? 
some of those certainly have a lot of difficulties , with all sorts of things , 
and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases . 
and they 've quoted statistics that my throat just about fell into my toes . 
that 's encouraging . 
and i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry , 
i do n't know . 
that 's an idea . 
maybe there need to be some radical changes made . 
do some things that are totally different and unheard of . 
you sit here 
and you think about that . 
at the same time you think , i hope i do n't sound like a stage mother because , right now if you ask my friends put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children , you 're going to have twenty hands up there . 
it 's not a kid who 's precocious . 
what has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who 's above average is now gifted ? 
i do n't know . 
that 's interesting . 
i do n't know . 
mine did not fall into the gifted category . 
do n't say that . 
and i would never had said so either . 
but they managed to get through , although not always with flying colors . 
and she showed me a paper that he had just handed in . 
and she told me what she had requested . 
and i read it 
and while it had a few little grammatical problems , it was n't very long and so forth . i thought it had some nice , well thought out parts to it . 
she gave him an f on that paper . 
and i thought , here you have a student who is trying to pass , who is struggling with your subject 
and you give them an f on something that does n't seem that bad to me . 
what are you telling that student ? 
you 're telling them that , you might as well forget it . 
i remember being taught , 
and you have to teach how to write an answer and how to construct a thought process . 
and they can grasp the points . 
can they convey the data verbally or in writing . 
and that 's what 's really scary to me . 
i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age . 
and they are telling that they do n't know how to read . 
i just really get my military , 
i married into a military family , 
and i do n't know , 
so i do n't offend anybody . 
but he sure had trouble putting things on paper . 
and one of the things that they did for him . they tested him 
and they said that he 's great in electronics 
but he really does need the basic skills . 
and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training . 
this is the kid who really barely made it through high school . 
that 's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it . 
you would have expected them to be the last ones to . 
so , i do n't know . 
it does make me nervous . 
i can see why if you 've got little ones just coming along . 
there 's a whole lot of stuff going on out there . 
there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there 
and part of me says i just would like to shut my eyes and pretend it does n't go on . or send them to private schools . 
and then the old social conscience says i 'm not working , 
i do n't need to work . 
maybe i should volunteer to teach what i know . 
or , the other part of me says i 've had enough kids . 
what do you think about it ? 
i guess i 'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the concern for the idea of , preserving privacy for , the individual , , 
privacy . 
because i ca n't really see why anyone who has nothing to hide would object . 
of course , that is certainly true , 
i 'm very much for drug testing , 
i really am . 
i 'm going to take the negative side just for a second , just to do it . 
i have to take medication for kidney transplant . 
and i 'm going to be taking that the rest of my life . 
if you had to have a drug test ? 
i have n't had one yet . 
and , we do have the random drug testing 
but i 've missed it so far . 
and what happens if they catch it , 
they think that i 'm on drugs 
and they send me and have me go through this , thing , 
checked out or whatever . 
but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that . , 
i agree that some innocent person might be victimized , by a false test , 
but i would think that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that . 
for example , that one positive would not be accepted as an automatic reason for whatever they might be going , to do if they found a positive dismissal or treatment or whatever , but that what it would do is it would trigger , perhaps one or two more stages where further tests could be done . 
on the other hand i think there 's certainly some professions that ought to be tested because of their responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in the transportation industry specifically . 
but in many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs , it 's not even going to effect anybody but himself and his own family , perhaps depending on the kind of drug he might be on . 
but and eventually that 's going to show up anyway in the way he works , and so on . 
but there 's so many things that it would make a difference . 
i guess i would not want to have anyone in my family victimized by a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , had n't been tested . 
like i said , i 'm very much pro testing , 
and this is why . 
i know this sounds like a slogan for the government , 
but we are in a war against , drugs . 
it 's horrible . 
you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not , 
and it takes some drastic steps at this point . 
and i think , personally , the drastic step has to be that you ca n't work if you continue taking drugs . 
it 's as simple as that . 
make it , not necessarily difficult , 
make it difficult enough . 
but make it so that it 's not glamorous . 
it 's glamorous taking drugs , 
or at least it seems that way . 
according to what you hear . 
really i guess we 're kind of lucky . 
they go to our church , 
and it 's the son and so on , 
and he was friends with my children , 
most of these are young people . 
i work in the education system 
and so i have a little more contact with that . 
and he may never really be a productive member of society . 
he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that he 's not sure if he 's going or not . 
and he 's now a young man about twenty who just got really down the wrong path . 
and i do n't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing . 
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me realize what it could do to people in the work force as well . 
it 's horrible . 
then , 
let 's answer the second half of the question . 
what limits ought to be put on it , do you think ? 
the limits would have to do with what i 'd alluded to before , that one positive on a drug test , would not constitute dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might have set up for those who genuinely have a problem . 
treatment before dismissal type thing . 
there needs to be more than one test , 
and there needs to be some measure of certainty before anything drastic happens . 
there are lots of things that are involved there such as , perhaps denial of insurance for someone , 
it would be unfair , 
and people who are on medication , for example , or even people who might be of the gay community , 
and i 'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society , 
but i think that there does n't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination 
because it makes a bigger problem . , 
i 'm not sure , though , when we talk about what rules , if any , that we should say , certain segments should not have to be tested . 
i really do n't see why , 
personally , i think that 's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested . 
and it may be it 's not feasible to do everyone , 
that it could happen . 
would be some measure of protection . 
but the bottom line is that if you 're going to stay clean and straight , then you 're going to do that because you want to . 
there 's going to be some measure of incentive reward or whatever , 
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want . 
so i 've got to agree with that . 
that 's very true . 
it sounds like we agree , anyway . 
i think so . 
i think we did pretty good . 
i guess that 's about it . 
i guess if that 's all we 've done 
and i guess we 've talked long enough . 
it was nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you , too . 
right at the present time nothing real special . 
i kind of like gardening 
i consider that a hobby . 
i do n't know , 
i guess that 's a really true hobby , 
but i think anything that you enjoy , 
it does n't really have to matter , 
it could be working on cars could be your hobby really . 
really 
i kind of enjoy doing that a little bit , too . 
i do n't know , 
i told my husband you go out some to work on the car , 
i says , you go pay to have someone do it . 
because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something . 
i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening , you 've still got a couple months to go , have n't you ? 
right now we start our seeds inside . 
that 's right , 
you would , 
we 'll start them inside 
we usually start them right in the house . 
my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck 
and a wind storm come and knock it down . 
but she 's had really good luck . 
next month , 
actually , if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside , pretty much the end of may , 
you can leave them outside . 
but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may . 
and i remember that it was on into may before it really started warming up , 
so we 're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts 
because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit ? 
we are a little lucky . 
my brother lives ten miles from here 
and , his crop gets killed . 
he remembers lots of snow . 
it 's , depressed economically . 
i do n't know why we have so much going for us , 
i really do n't . 
i just wrote my resume up because 
and they 've had layoffs recently , 
but when we got hired here never any layoffs , never , never , 
i 'm a technician . 
when they start getting rid of technicians , 
i interviewed with them . 
we 're getting to where , we 're straying , i guess , 
stick on the subject . 
interesting thing that i do is with , gardening , 
my sister grows flowers that you can dry , 
and you can make dried flower arrangements 
and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun . 
it 's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries . 
it 's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it 
at first i 'm why do people like this , 
but it is kind of a nice smell after a while . 
people put them in , 
i did n't realize what it was for a while . 
and i 'd wonder what is that , 
it 's , like a fad thing . 
i do n't know . 
i 've never heard of it , 
it is . 
maybe that 's why they 're so slow . 
i guess they 're stoned on the stuff or something . 
it looks really potent stuff . 
but i think it 's the greatest stuff in the world , though . 
i make all kinds of things with it . 
we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers . 
i almost want to start a business doing it , 
but i 'm so timid when it comes to starting a business . 
that 's a big step , 
it is , especially with being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end . 
after a while you make some stuff , 
then you start looking at it , 
go , this is kind of ugly . 
he does it i would n't imagine why , but to get out of the house , away from his wife , 
because he 's a seasonal worker , 
he works in the construction . 
and up here it 's almost a pattern , 
and you see your fathers do it , 
then their sons do it . 
what they do is they work construction , 
then they get laid off for twelve weeks in the winter . 
and this guy was going nuts , 
and he makes , all kinds of furniture for his kids , 
and he makes little kids ' furniture . 
he gets right into it 
they may be the same kind of people you 're talking about . 
they 've got twelve weeks to do something , 
and they 're making furniture and just things like that during the winter 
and then they go off and do other things during the summer . 
plus he 's getting on in his years now . 
he 's not that old , 
but he 's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost , to do something like that . 
and it 's , hard work . 
i could n't imagine taking raw lumber and trying to make something out of it . 
man , 
and it 's all got to line up . 
i do n't see too much scrap around . 
that 's something . 
so as far as planting outdoor stuff , matter of fact , tonight i was planting some trees out back tonight , 
and it 's really nice , out tonight . 
is it going to be really dry ? 
i always plant trees in the fall . 
i do n't know why 
the cold weather can kill them 
i do n't know where they came from . 
and they come down here 
and they 'll sit in the nurseries here 
and they 'll go ahead and , leaf out . 
that 's good . 
i guess they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall . 
mostly , i think in a place where it 's really cold they do it in the fall , let them winter through the fall , 
but down here it 's done both ways . 
it just kind of depends on what you 're planting , 
and when you have time to do it . 
my sister does flower gardens . 
she gets right into it . 
she spends lots of money on them . 
and i guess a lot of people do do that . 
they landscape their whole house with flower gardens . 
during the summer down here , the normal kind of flowers , there 's very few of them that will really do well . 
and then the heat sets in . 
it gets , 
most of those kind of plants are just barely staying alive , let alone make flowers . 
we 're in a relatively new area . 
we 're kind of out of the natural tree area . 
we 're kind of up on a slope . 
you do n't have a lot of tree coverage ? 
where we are right now there are very few trees . 
because going to make , 
this was pasture land , 
my grandmother passed away , 
where is this ? 
i like the way that idea of the south is , 
i tell you what , 
the two cities are very identical , 
it 's that dry heat ? 
it 's , not dry at all . 
it 's humid . 
where is it , 
it 's humid . 
what type of lawn and garden work do you do ? 
i do it all . 
i see . 
do you have a garden ? 
i try to grow a vegetable garden 
we do the same thing . 
i just have a small plot 
it 's ten feet by five feet . 
i have two plots , 
one 's ten by ten 
i see . 
you do a lot more area than i do . 
it 's all the dirt i have , left in my backyard . 
i see . 
i see . 
it 's cheap entertainment . 
it 's nice to get out in the open air . 
it is , 
that 's right . 
but sometimes i wish i had more space . 
excuse me , go ahead . 
i grow a lot of things , a lot of food . 
and sometimes i want to plant something , 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
takes a lot of room . 
and it takes up your whole space . 
it sure does . 
what a mistake that was . 
they just run all over , the place , do n't they , 
they do . 
it was very good 
it just takes up like you say , a lot of your garden area . 
it 's the first and only time i 've done that . 
we do n't do anything exotic 
the basics . 
that 's what we do too . 
my wife used to plant a few snow peas . 
i do n't really care for snow peas . 
she just plants a few for herself . 
peas 
i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago . 
did you really ? 
i read it , 
i see . 
we , just wait until the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground . 
i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that , 
probably so . 
you can get a head start on it . 
but sure is a heck of a lot of work . 
i guess it , would , 
because you got to , watch them every day , and keep them watered 
and i do n't think i 'll do it again . 
it will make them taste better i 'm sure . 
i enjoy it . 
i come home from work 
and i usually say hello to wife and kids , and then go out and fiddle just walk around the yard and inspect it 
you got to inspect it , 
and the kids want to swing , 
and i push them on swing . 
and i mow my own lawn . 
and i do n't have a sprinkler system . 
i do n't enjoy watering . 
especially , 
this is the first home we 've lived in we 've had a sprinkler system , 
and it is really nice , 
it sure beats dragging hoses around . 
you can have it come on just early in the morning . and off by the time you 're up and about . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
it 's really nice . 
i usually get it started for my wife 
and she moves it around ever other day . 
i 'll have to admit i do my own yard . 
i really do n't enjoy doing that . 
i enjoy having a nice looking yard , 
i just do n't enjoy the work , that it takes to get it done . 
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months until i retired 
and now i 've lost my excuse for that 
so i have to , 
for the last couple of years i 've done it myself . 
but they want too much money . 
it is kind of expensive , 
it is . 
of course , the chemicals themselves when you buy them , they 're expensive too . 
but it 's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself . 
that 's right . 
if i have a problem discipline i think , i really need to get out and apply something , 
and the weed come up , 
that 's right . 
and all of a sudden you 've got to do something else . 
that 's right . 
i 'm kind of bad about that . 
i enjoyed having a lawn service 
but now i have the time 
and i really do n't , want to spend the money for it . 
if you , enjoy it too you can get out in the morning before it gets hot and do it and stuff , when you only have to , 
that 's right . 
i can do it on most any day of the week . 
when the days start getting a little longer i can start doing it in the evening after work . 
that 's right . 
when we get an hour more , 
when they rollback an hour . 
that 's coming up here pretty soon . 
is it this weekend ? 
i do n't know . 
it 's pretty soon . 
i really do n't know . 
it just seems like i here it on the news the day before . 
and i think it 's coming up here soon . 
i believe it is too . 
are you having any trouble with bugs in your garden ? 
not a whole lot . 
i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust . 
i do n't really like to put a lot chemicals on it 
but then , again , i do n't want the bugs eating it either . 
it seems like they come in spurts . 
one year i did n't put anything on 
and i did n't have any problems . 
they were just covered with them , 
i did n't go out there for about three days 
and i went out there one day 
and the plant was nothing left but a stem , 
that 's right . 
they devoured it that quickly . 
they really go through it , 
and , they , have a good appetite . 
they really do . 
i picked off like twenty of them 
and i 've been watching them every day 
and i have n't seen any signs yet . 
so , if i see any signs i 'm going to spray them , 
i did something a little bit different this year that i have n't done before , 
it 's kind like this box shape , 
and various other things , 
raised it up . 
the good stuff . 
and i 'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there that maybe i 'll have less of a bug problem 
at least they 'll have a hard time crawling up the thing . 
so i built a box up 
had to build , the low side up . 
i had a dump truck come and dump it . 
but you can improve your own soil there 
that 's right , 
you , really do . 
you know what i mean . 
that 's right . 
i do n't , 
i did it by hand , 
small enough , 
just do it by hand ? 
it was n't too much of a job . 
i 'd like to get one of these little small ones , that you see in all these gardening magazines . 
it would be handy . 
and it weighs twenty pounds or , something like that . 
my neighbor across the street has one . 
i see him out there , 
it might be handy , 
i 've never seen one . 
i have a friend who has one 
and it 's a fairly large one to , 
if i , just go to my garage and grab it . 
that would be neat , 
that would be nice . 
we 've had a garden for years and years and years , of some size , 
i ca n't remember a year when we did n't have one of some kind . 
what have you got growing right now ? 
snow , 
what kind , 
excuse me . 
do you grow ? 
for the first time we planted them this year . 
they are the best . 
we tried to find them last year , 
we screwed around and waited too long 
and i could n't find a nursery that had any of them left . 
but we 've got some this year . 
snow peas are up 
and my wife does a small herb garden on the side . 
i see . 
they 're up and doing fine . 
and we really missed them when they were gone , because the ones from the grocery store just ca n't , compare . 
that 's kind of a , let down . 
i bet , 
they were . 
that 's right . 
we use a lot , 
we sure do . 
we let some turn red . 
we did that too , 
and some we do green 
makes a colorful salad too . 
put them in salad , 
you 're making me hungry here . 
we 've tried it , before 
and 
we have n't had much luck with it 
we 're going to try it again this year . 
they have some little buds on them 
hopefully they 'll do something . 
sounds like you have a real good garden . 
we enjoy fooling around with it . 
just let me see what i got , 
i got the peas 
and i planted potatoes too . 
i 've never done potato . 
we used to do it at home when i was a kid , had a huge garden . 
the potato , 
they 're delicious 
you do n't seem to get that much for the space , 
they do . 
it does take some space . 
some potatoes 
and i 've got some tomatoes still growing , in containers , 
i see . 
i got to wait for a place to free up . 
that will be neat , 
that will be neat , 
they 're expensive . 
i know it . 
i said , why are they so expensive 
i do n't know unless it , labor intensive or something . 
i really , do n't know . 
i guess . 
but we 're going to try that , and see how that works . 
that will be interesting . 
an experiment . 
i 'd like to just try something new , every year that , i have n't tried before 
that 's interesting . 
i 'll let you go 
what would you have at a dinner party ? 
lately , since i have children i 've cut down on having dinner parties . 
but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time , 
that sounds great . 
it 's really good 
and you can make it ahead of time and then make the sauce when you 're ready to serve it . 
that 's one of my favorite things to serve . 
i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party . 
but i would n't have to worry about satisfying my guest . 
and it 's usually well liked by people , i guess , 
i 'm just a seafood fan 
in fact , i just came back from the grocery store 
you 're not supposed to eat them dead . 
you eat them dead 
do n't buy them that way . 
and you 're not supposed to eat those because they 're bad for you . 
i 'll remember that . 
it does n't happen very often because it 's just an accident 
but if the tail is straight on it then do n't eat it . 
but you just put lots of pepper 
and you just boil them 
and they 're absolutely wonderful 
once you get used to it they 're real easy 
i do n't know 
it depends . 
if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party they would shell their own , 
but if it was more formal like if i was working environment then i would probably shell 'em or at least disconnect them from the head . 
but there 's a , big thing over here that everybody sucks the head . 
still have . 
so it would just depend . 
but i do n't know 
it just depends on what type it was i guess 
but you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled 
and they 're more expensive of course 
it really does 
we have a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks all the time 
that 's what i need 
that 's what i wish i had 
and i really enjoy it 
it 's gotten a little more difficult with kids 
but i really do enjoy cooking 
and we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot 
was really a lot of fun 
i bet 
that got pretty competitive as far as who could come up with the best recipe 
it did 
we tried to be fancier or 
that would be fun 
it was a lot of fun 
it 
it was a lot of fun 
sometimes it might be the candlelight 
and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something 
that 's right 
that 's fun 
it was fun 
and we threatened to make the other two make us dinner one time just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying 
that sounds right 
i 'd take him up on that 
it does 
except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just to make sure that they did n't have to do it again 
make hot dogs or some potato chips 
that 's about how much i can cook 
i 'm doing a lot more cooking now than i used to 
but that 's only because my mom just started working 
so she 's tired when she comes home in the afternoon 
so i try to have things cooked for her 
but i usually try to stay out of kitchen 
that 's nice 
i do n't know 
it can be fun if you have the time 
but a lot of times it 's too much of a rush really 
whenever we have the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce 
i do n't know 
and they are absolutely delicious 
i 'm sure she puts wine in it because she cooks everything with alcohol 
i do n't know 
i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around 
it 's in the other room 
i do n't know if we have enough time for it 
it 's real easy 
that would be wonderful 
and that adds something new to it 
so it 's not a thick rich type of a sauce 
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency 
and then drain off all the grease 
then what i usually do is i freeze them 
if they 're frozen it may take a half for them to thaw out 
but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself 
and it 's real good 
that sounds great 
and then freeze them 
that would be great 
i 'm sure that i 'll be involved in a big company 
and i know that my future husband will be 
i 'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy 
you 'll meet friends 
invite the boss over and friends at work 
i have to impress the boss and clients cause i 'm in public relations in school 
so my whole job 's going to be based on my clients 'n stuff like that 
so i 'm going to have lots of dinner parties 
and have to take 'em out to eat 
i thought for sure i 'd been raised properly 
but i 've been doing a lot of things wrong i did n't know about 
so is there anything else 
i think we 've covered the subject 
it 's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale 
they 're wonderful . 
i will 
ironically enough i 'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last . 
exercise is not supposed to do that to you . 
that 's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way down the hallway . 
do you do anything on a regular basis ? 
off and on , 
off and on . 
right now i 've been off 
but , i 've been going over to the fitness center . 
three times , 
i try to go over there at least three times a week , 
and i try to walk at least five times a week . 
do you , when you go to the , 
i have to ask you , 
and if this is getting to , 
we 're not supposed to get too particular , 
but i 'm just curious , 
it 's not that great , 
but my husband 's working over there 
but i just do n't , 
it 's just so much weight lifting . 
that 's true . 
or is that what you 're into 
i do n't use the free weights 
i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there . 
i like those too . 
and the pool when it gets warmer . 
and the pool , 
that 's great . 
i know . 
this is really a stupid thing that happened , 
and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it . 
i know . 
and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show . 
and the doctor said , you did n't do anything . 
so we went to one 
and he just put a big old cast on it . 
put a big cast on it . 
for about four weeks . 
four weeks , 
i like aerobics , 
not that much , though . 
i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i 'd had , 
but i was pretty much in shape walking 
and , this is one of those things , 
i was real embarrassed , 
but i felt kind of stupid . 
those things happen , though . 
they do . 
i guess i 'm glad that nobody really noticed , i guess you could say . 
because i got up and started jumping on it again . 
that did a lot of good , 
i 'm sure . 
really . 
i enjoy aerobics , 
and i do it because i like it , 
i like the music and that kind of stuff . 
i like the music , 
but i 've been unable to do that , because i hurt my foot about five years ago . 
i broke my heel . 
and 
how 'd you do that ? 
in aerobics ? 
actually i was up on a ladder , and fell off . leaned the wrong way . 
and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot , but on concrete . 
what 'd they do for that ? 
did they have to cast it ? 
they had to go in and do surgery . 
they put a pin in it . 
so the impact , would not be good . 
as i permanently damaged the cushion under my heel the normal cushion that you have there . 
i ca n't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt . 
that makes sense . 
so are you , in terms of other things not running , but playing a little bit of tennis , 
can you not do stuff like that at all ? 
i have n't tried that . 
i do n't know . 
i bet it 's been thirty years since i played tennis . 
mostly into just walking and stuff like that . 
that 's probably the safer way 
i 'm always afraid they 're going to fall over and have a coronary . 
and there was my ego when i went ahead 
and i went , i can do that 
i 'm real tall , 
and i 'm not heavy , 
but when you go easy you need just . 
and i just do n't think it 's healthy 
all that pounding all the time . 
, it 's not really good for your knees . 
that 's the other reason , 
and , i do n't know , 
the floor was uneven . 
the two dissimilar floor coverings were not level . 
and at first after it happened i thought , maybe that 's a handicap access , 
and then i said no , 
that 's just the way it 's constructed . 
i said a few things to him when i got home , 
i said , who has engineered that ? . 
you like that a lot ? 
i like swimming . 
do you like that , what that voice said , 
do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to ? 
i liked it because i want to , 
it makes me feel better . 
that 's how i am . 
if i do n't do it i just feel like i do n't have as much energy . 
but it 's the other way around . 
and i need all the help i can get . 
that gravity factor , 
i know . 
it does get you . 
he said , you 're at thirty something , 
but you 're on the upper side . 
he said that , do n't worry , 
he says , even if you were n't doing anything that would start to happen to you . 
a lot . 
because i said , i 'm not that heavy , 
i 'm not heavy , 
i said , why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more . 
and he goes , human nature . 
that 's true , 
they do . 
except for the guys that lift the weights . 
i try to go real late or real early before they get there . 
there some things i 'd like to try , 
but sometime when i ask , i just feel like , am i stupid or what . 
at least one of the fellows that 's there at night and on weekends is real helpful . 
there was some girl there . 
i 've been there maybe a dozen times . 
it 's terrible . 
that 's true . 
i have n't either , 
it 's not that far of a drive 
and i 'm glad they did that . 
it 's not at all anything worth talking about . 
i thought maybe one of these days i 'll drive over there and check it out . 
but it 's all the same to me . 
i was one thing , 
and they 're going . 
but in general i like dance a lot , 
so aerobics is something i 'd hate to give up . 
but he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot , 
but he just said to me , maybe you ought to try bicycling 
you probably will for a while , because it 's going to be real tender . 
he told me eight to twelve weeks . 
not anything . 
i said , but you 're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks . 
the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed , 
i could n't adjust that . 
i know what you mean . 
you know more about this stuff than i do , obviously then , 
not fun . 
you 're walking okay now obviously , 
i have a slight limp from it , 
but it matches one if i have one on the other side . 
anything else about exercise we can talk about . 
other than i need to go . 
me too , 
me too . 
i need to go actually get something to eat here . 
it 's great though , 
i really do enjoy it . 
thank you , sandy . 
what would you say your opinion is on gun control ? 
i do n't know . 
i 'm against it 
but on the same token i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that . 
the ammunition is probably so old i 'm afraid to use it . 
but i bought it for target practicing and also because i wanted a weapon . 
how do you feel about it ? 
and , i think they need that . 
and i have a pistol . 
i do n't know if i 'll ever use it . 
and like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably about three years old . 
my gun has n't been shot in a year or two . 
but i like to have them handy . 
and i thought that was really good . 
takes two weeks for that system to process your request to buy ammunition . 
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that . 
i 've never heard of anything like that . 
that would be nice . 
the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other . 
i agree . 
i think one of the things that needs to happen is to stop the impulse buyer from buying it quickly and , maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it . 
and you can get them really cheap . 
i know 
and we bought it there . 
how long was the waiting period out there ? 
about nine days . 
that was n't too , too bad . 
because if you 're going to go buy something of that nature , i think you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it . 
you 're not going to react that quickly . 
in other words you do n't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day . 
they both do the same kind of job . 
i suppose . 
i never got shot with either one . 
but i do n't know , 
or at least ours does . 
you have a little thing on top of the barrel where you turn it , 
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get . 
and the spread changes . 
and i guess it does n't have any automatic features to it . 
the further away i get , the , wider the shot gets from the target . 
and the closer that i get , the tighter that it gets . 
it 's got a hell of a kick to it . 
my husband had a police gun at one time . 
and i shot that thing one time . 
almost knocked me down . 
i forget , 
i 'm not sure . 
do you belong to a gun club 
he belonged to one awhile back . 
and we ca n't even find a place to shoot . just for target practice . 
the , clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive 
but it 's well worth it . 
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have competition . 
i 've never really joined a club because i have n't got the time . not because i have n't got the desire . 
there 's an annual membership fee that 's fairly high . 
plus there 's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time member . 
plus you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in . 
he went mostly just to shoot at paper targets . 
but they used speed and accuracy and all that . 
i think that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose . 
i 've never thought of that . 
that 's a good point . 
even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how to handle it , it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that does n't know how to drive . 
and you give him a license because he waited nine days . 
and . 
he could not only shoot himself . 
he was fortunate . 
he could of hit something else . 
he went tumbling down the steps along with shooting his foot almost off . 
he broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things , being , mister cowboy . 
i ca n't remember what the term was going around . 
it was about four or five years ago . 
i guess that would be a good idea . 
about private citizens selling a weapons ? 
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me . 
how do you feel about that ? 
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the buyer and the seller ? 
or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system because you own it ? 
that 's a hard one because we did that . 
but i think there ought to be some rule against it . 
i have no idea . 
i 've only had one gun 
and i 've kept it the one gun that was in my name . 
is it registered ? 
and i do n't know why i never registered it 
i think it 's voluntary . 
my husband has a thing . 
my kid is jumping on me . 
i ca n't hardly talk . 
my husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns . 
i guess that could happen . 
it 's just like the social security system . 
once they gave everybody a number 
and now they 're making you get one at birth . 
and once they have your number , they have your identification . 
and if you try to do anything like not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are . 
and everything about you . 
and , that 's true . 
i 've lost my train of thought . 
i 'm sorry . 
that 's all right . 
you were talking about what the federal government knows about people . 
they probably know everything from , half the time what time you go to the bathroom . 
they probably do . 
that 's a little bit extreme . 
but they could know anything and everything about you . 
and i 'd like to have my gun . 
if they go to banning them , i 'd lose my gun 
and we 're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about . 
do you find it difficult picking up guns that are not registered ? 
i do n't either . 
i can buy some today if i wanted to . 
just put up the money . 
we got a thing down here called a shopper . 
it 's a bargain thing . 
you go and always see guns in there . 
five to seven guns a day . 
and there 's no waiting period on that . 
none whatsoever . 
we sold a refrigerator through it 
and it took us all of twelve hours . 
to sell the refrigerator ? 
and i 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun . 
and i think the federal government is really far away from control . 
i should n't probably say control . 
i mean regulation . 
control is something that i would n't want the federal government to have . 
but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons . 
i agree with you there . 
they do have too much control over us already . 
we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have . 
unfortunately we vote for the people who spend the money , 
so i ca n't complain too much . 
i guess so . 
i do n't know . 
what kind of movies have you seen , lately ? 
a lot , 
obviously you have kids . 
that 's right . 
i have n't seen that one yet . 
that 's an excellent movie . 
the last movie i saw was sleeping with the enemy . 
was that good . 
but i was a lot more impressed with her than i thought i would be . 
that 's good . 
it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be . 
it was a pretty good movie . 
i 'm ready to go . 
it has n't worked out that way yet . 
it is . 
and i do . 
in fact , people i 've talked to said that they had n't slept real good for a while afterwards . 
i love them like that . 
i like all ranges of movies , 
but i like that where they run tense . 
they keep me guessing the whole time . 
it was really interesting . 
what other movies have you seen then lately ? 
the new one , of course . 
is that any good , 
i 'm sure i 'm going to be seeing it because in a week , 
and she 's got two boys that i took to see the first one . 
so i 'm sure i 'm going to see the next one here real soon . 
i did n't see the first one . 
my husband said it was about the same lines . 
then it wo n't be too bad . 
so . 
it was n't impressive necessarily , 
but it was better than it could have been . 
you know what i mean . 
my daughter 's five , 
she understood everything . 
she goes to almost all movies with us except r rated . 
and she really enjoyed it , 
but it was on a higher level where there were some things that kids did n't understand that adults did , 
and i liked that . 
i think that 's important 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
it 's pretty good . 
but we take her to just about every movie , 
and she does really good . 
we 've taken her from real young , 
and she does real good . 
i 's about to say , you 're not going to take her to that one , i 'm sure . 
what was the last comedy you saw ? 
what was the last comedy we saw ? 
. good question , 
good question . 
we do n't get to go that often , 
but something on the tip of my tongue , 
and i ca n't think of which one it was . 
. i ca n't remember . 
in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw 
i said that wrong , 
but that sounds good . 
that really was n't too bad . 
he 's this actor 
and he 's playing a cop . 
or he 's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff . 
i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop . 
there were times when he 'd be running with a gun or whatever . 
he did n't look like a cop when he did it . 
that 's neat . 
the part was hard , to do that . 
because everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to imitate them or whatever . 
and i thought he did such an excellent job of not going that far . 
by the end he was looking more like a cop . 
but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part he was trying to get it , 
but he was n't there yet . 
and you could tell it , 
and i guess that was a real good acting and writing job both or directing job . 
i think they did a real good job of that . 
i like him . 
and there were some definite tense moments , with him in there . 
probably the last comedy we saw , now that i think about it , is home alone . 
but i took a date to it about a month ago . 
so , i 've seen it the second time not too long ago . 
it was really cute . 
i really enjoyed it . 
of course , the bad thing about it was the second time i saw it , i did n't really enjoy it as much , 
and i was kind of surprised at that . 
i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over . 
maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction to the first time . 
it just was n't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time . 
i do n't know 
maybe so , 
maybe so . 
it was a great movie though . 
i loved the movie . 
i did , too . 
i 'm looking forward to this summer , 
naked gun two and a half is coming out . 
i love those movies . 
i do too . 
you have to see those twice to catch everything . 
you have to see them more than that . 
i still catch things in airplane that i did n't catch . 
it 's amazing 
i do too . 
i love those movies 
i do too . 
i really do . 
so i 'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious , as they all do . 
, we try to go a couple times a month to see a movie . 
it 's just getting so expensive . 
is n't it though . 
that 's exactly what , i was going to say . 
i keep not doing it until after i 'm there 
easily . 
nowhere near that expensive . 
and , it 's just the idea that these actors live in such lavish style . 
it 's as simple as that . 
we just keep breeding them . 
and as long as we keep paying the money for it , they are going to keep paying them . 
i guess so . 
that was an excellent movie . 
we 're waiting for the video . 
do n't . 
do n't . 
that needs the big screen . 
you really truly do . 
i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video , too . 
but i 'm glad i did n't . 
i really and truly am . 
that was one movie i came out impressed . 
i really and truly did . 
none at all . 
i wanted him to win best actor on top of it , 
now that i think back on it , i 'd say i ca n't believe that either . 
you know what i mean . 
it was just too perfect at all times . 
that was a mistake that they made . 
they should n't have done it . 
the supporting actor , he was good , 
but from what i heard , the guy who got it was better , 
so i can see that . 
you think my daughter would like it ? 
she does n't mind when we cover up her eyes . 
no problems . 
and i know they 're fake . 
and 
but they do n't stress that very much , 
they really do n't . 
if she enjoys movies i think it 'll work pretty good . 
that 'll be good . 
it 's a long movie . 
and i heard the video 's even going to be longer . 
they did a lot of stuff that they cut out . 
i may have to see the video . 
that 's true , 
i had n't even thought of that . 
so they 're going to put it in the video . 
and that way you can watch it at your leisure . 
there are certain things you ca n't do with a video 
and the idea that they may put a little extra in it is a good idea . 
videos , of course , are not cheap either 
and so the idea of getting a little extra with it is a good idea . because they make bundles of money off those things . 
i know it . 
is n't that ridiculous . 
we have cable which helps a lot . 
i do too . 
but not enough . 
we keep holding out . 
so probably everything i going to say is kind of dated . 
i can understand that . 
it 's that time of the year . 
my wife and i just recently moved into our house . 
so we 're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things . but . like to keep up to date too . 
i think when you 're in college you have more of a regular schedule in terms of , you can watch every week . 
that makes a big difference . 
so 
where i was home 
where i watched things on a more regular basis . 
but right now , the last things i watched regularly was thirty something when it first came out . 
did you all ever watch that ? 
i started , too , and kind of worked away from that . 
you feel kind of left out . 
but . 
i know , 
but i tell you what , 
we 're really strict with our kids about television , 
and one night , couple weeks ago , it just happened that we were exhausted 
and they wanted to watch , 
and we said we 'll sit down 
and we 'll look at what you want to see . 
let 's just turn it on and see what 's on . 
we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it . 
i believe that . 
so it was prime time , 
and we have cable , 
and there was n't anything on any channel , 
it was just dribble 
it was n't even funny 
that 's right . 
it was n't creative , 
it was the worst i 've seen . 
i know exactly how you feel . 
you know what i 'm saying . 
that 's right . 
and i guess i kind of became numb . 
right now we do n't have cable . 
and it 's surprising how much it 's changed 
the whole moral situation , everything , is just gone one whole complete direction different . 
and we do n't have any kids yet , 
but i feel the same way . 
it 's really tough to find something that 's going to be good and interesting for the kids . even cartoons , 
you watch some of the cartoons , 
and kids are n't even going to understand half the humor that 's in there . 
none of it 's probably damaging , lot of times . 
it 's just , a necessary evil . 
and that was about it . 
but it 's , just one of those things , 
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something , because those drive you crazy , if you 're in the room . 
but it 's such a shame , because it could be so good . 
that 's right . 
i do n't understand why the public puts up with it why the networks think that we enjoy that kind of stuff . 
that 's true . 
it 's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that . 
that ca n't be the problem . 
it must be the marketing pressures , 
i 'm glad you said it 
i feel the exact same way . 
i sit and watch some shows , 
and i 'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show . 
i know . 
why do you do this to yourself ? 
why do you do this ? 
i know , 
i 'm trying to think if there 's anything i do , 
i like stuff that 's on great performances , 
and , we used to watch mystery quite a bit and things like that . 
there 's an idea . 
that was just the rule . 
and if they saw us watching something , they 'd say , what did you see on what 's new , 
the children 's program at the time was called what 's new . 
so we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program . 
that 's pretty good . 
are you a sports fan ? 
i ca n't handle it very long . 
i 'm a sports fan , 
but it 's kind of like reading magazines any more . 
if half of the time was n't spent watching commercials , it probably would n't be so bad . 
you 're missing an awful lot . 
but , i do n't sit down , 
that 's true , 
i 'll sit down for the big games , the super bowl , and the championship things like that . 
but i do n't follow any team . 
i check the scores the next morning , 
and i know how everybody 's doing , 
but , i like good humor once in a while . 
i enjoy that , 
you do n't have cable now , 
i was going to say they have a comedy channel now . 
but again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly commercials , 
and then you 're trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up . 
you know what i did . 
there was a time there where i could tape things 
and then i 'd fast forward through the commercials . 
saved a lot of time that way . 
it works , 
you bet , 
but , that takes too much planning . 
i do n't know , 
if there 's any series that i pay attention to , i try to watch cheers once in a while . 
is that still real good . 
it used to be real good . 
it is . 
is it . 
in fact , i think it 's on tonight . 
i just got in from outside , 
so i 'm kind of out of it . 
things like that , 
and i consider that fairly intelligent humor . 
you can tell , 
they pick up the words every once in a while . 
is n't it such a long running program . 
they do have good writers for that . 
that makes me think , 
i try to . 
we try to stay up , too . 
it 's getting harder and harder . 
ten years ago was n't so hard to stay up . 
it was just automatic , too , 
no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it . 
i think it 's come around again . 
it 's gone through cycles . 
we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there , 
but we started watching again . 
but it 's real different show than it was when it started . 
it 's funny now , 
and it 's better , 
but it 's real different than what it used to be . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
but you ca n't be outrageous . 
if you keep that same format . there 's only so long that you can be outrageous . 
that 's for sure , 
that is for sure . 
i guess there are a few things around still 
but you have to hunt hard for them . 
sounds like you pretty much agree . 
i guess so . 
been good talking to you . 
good talking to you . 
take care . 
you too . 
what kind of cars are you looking at ? 
and i have two kids 
and my fiancee has two kids 
so we need a car that 's big enough for six . 
and so two weekends ago , we went , car shopping and looked around . 
so , they call this program cars , 
and they come , with a new car warranty , 
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that . 
that 's a real good deal . 
and it 's been a real good car 
and it 's like new 
and it only had very , very low mileage on it . 
and so i think he got a real good deal . 
of course , they 're fully loaded usually . 
so i think it 's a pretty good option . 
i think so too . 
or they used , 
are they new . 
the ones that we were test driving were the new ones there . 
the guy said it 'd been on the lot about thirty minutes . 
he says it 'll probably be gone in , 
and it 's probably gone by now . 
those things go fast . 
the price already drops in half . 
so then it becomes more realistic . 
that 's what i 'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new 
or do i look for a used car that 's maybe two , three years old but that 's low mileage and in good shape . 
but i kind of worry about getting a car that 's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it . 
or is something wrong with it 
that 's right . 
but i guess that 's a risk you have to take . 
that 's right . 
you can reduce that risk by having the car checked out , 
but if you 've narrowed it down to one or two you can have the car checked at an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong , because they do n't have any financial interest in it . 
and then you 'll have a realistic assessment of what you 're getting . 
about how much do they charge to do something like that , 
do you know ? 
that 's not bad . 
it 'd be well worth it if you 're considering buying a car . to find out . 
i would think so . 
i would think so . 
it 's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago , 
is n't that a good feeling . 
i do n't want to think about buying a car for a while . 
i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and hang on to the one i 've got for a few years because it 's almost four years old , 
that 's right . 
but it 's still in great shape . 
what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years 
and when you 're ready to get another car just pay cash for it . 
if i continue taking good care of it , it 's going to hold a pretty good resale value 
and if i consider going the used car route and save up some money , i should n't have too much trouble at all . 
i would think that 's true . 
could you hold on for just a moment ? 
and i was picking up some background noise , 
so i just switched the channel up on it . 
i did n't want to interfere with whatever they 're trying to record . 
that 's fine . 
but i really enjoy the car i have now , 
and i do want to hold onto it and enjoy it while it 's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever , 
that 's right . 
in fact it never has 
that 's right . 
and it 's been kind of nice , 
and surprisingly enough after four years , i 'm not tired of the car at all 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
eventually . 
i 've bought three cars , 
and i 've always bought them new . 
the second car i ever bought i drive to work now . 
that just turned ten years old , 
so that 's kind of in the way i 've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever . 
but , it runs fine , 
it 's just very thirsty . 
if i just keep the oil in , it seems to be okay . 
but that 's a sign that i 'm going to have to do something sooner or later . 
what kind of car is it ? 
are you going to trade it in on this new one 
it 's actually , in better condition than my car . 
and so she 's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low . 
so she 's going to sell it rather than trade it in . 
that 's probably the best thing . 
you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in . 
or maybe more than that , as i 've learned . 
there you go . 
you can do much better . 
i 'm glad you 're taking care of it yourself . 
they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you 're buying , 
but they just , are going to give you that much less for your trade in . 
that 's fact . 
what i think . 
i think you 're right . 
interesting . 
i bet you it 's kind of what i decided . 
did you use it at the car shop place . 
it 's before they had that . 
and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the fleet program , 
that 's right , 
and what you could expect , they said a five percent over cost and then options at cost and everything . 
so , i figured out a price based on that . 
that 's good . 
he said , you 're going to get a car that 's got flood damage or hail damage . 
and they just laughed at me . 
and they gave it to me for that price . 
and what 's so funny , i knew they were going to pull it from town north because that 's where the white one was . 
is that right . 
and they had already told me , we located one at town north . 
so it was that same car . 
unless you 're selling car with hail damage and flood damage , i got the car off your lot for that price . 
and you laughed all the way to the bank . 
i did . 
that they required you to do . 
and i took it to town north , 
and sure enough i saw that guy , 
and he recognized me . 
and he kind of looked down and saw that car , 
and i 'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day 
that 's right . 
he said , they 're not . 
so i 'm sure he knew . 
such a deal . 
i loved it . 
i sat there , 
i 'll bet you did . 
it was kind of nice . 
i appreciate talking with you . 
good talking to you too , don . 
have a good evening . 
good luck in your car hunting . 
thank you much . 
i have n't heard anything about the proposal myself , 
but i do n't know if it 's their proposal or one that 's being seriously kicked around . 
i have n't either . 
i 've always felt for a long time that i think that all young kids ought to do a stint primarily in the military . 
most countries require that now , 
they have it mandatory for at least the young men , 
i do n't know about the young women , 
i do n't know if they have to serve in the military , too . 
a lot , 
everybody does . 
i do n't think it 's a bad idea , 
teaches a lot . 
is that right ? 
did a lot of growing up . 
i bet . 
you have to . 
my father had been in the military . 
i did n't do it myself . 
and that 's how he put himself through school basically . 
he came from a poor immigrant family , 
the family was n't wealthy , 
so he had to do something to , put himself through school , 
do it himself . 
and he did . 
and he was very successful . 
my parents wanted to send me to college , 
and i was dead set against it . 
and i got in , 
so i started to work on my education . 
course my job was such that i could n't do it as much as i wanted 
that 's pretty good . 
but , i 've been in school ever since . 
that 's good . 
i guess . 
i do n't know . 
there 's other kinds of service to the country that could be done , 
working in the national parks , working 
all this money that we 're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients , 
if nothing else , get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards , paint the houses . 
we 'd learn service to other people in this country . 
get something out of that money . 
country would benefit , 
my next door neighbor when i was growing up , worked for the unemployment division , 
that right . 
and he had all kinds of horror stories . 
these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks , 
and , back in those days they also use to give you booklets good for clothing and gas , and things like this . 
they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games , 
and i have a hard time dealing with that . 
i was astounded . 
i do n't even make that . 
i know . 
and somebody 's taking that away . 
and there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy . 
no doubt . 
it 's totally ridiculous , 
and when i first got in graduate school i was going into public administration , 
and quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just could n't stand it any more . 
is that right , 
this is the kind of thing you look at . 
you sit there 
and when you 're writing up budgets , you wonder , how much money do we need . 
you need x number dollars for the recipients 
but you need x number dollars to administer the program . 
just ridiculous . 
this is ridiculous . 
it 's sad . 
it is , 
it 's pathetic . 
there 's got to be a different way . 
there 's got to be a better way . 
but it 'll never happen . 
these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks . 
what would happen if the required young people to do service to the country , 
what should they get in return , i wonder . 
and i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance . 
give an incentive . 
something that 's going to help them along the way . 
and they 'll help the country eventually , too , because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people , 
look at the statistics , 
and that 's only going to help . 
it 's sad . 
adults , that is , ca n't even read . 
and we 've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math . 
what are we becoming ? 
we 're becoming a service country . 
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago . 
we were an industrial giant , 
and now we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game . 
we taught them how to do it , 
and they did it better than we do . 
simple as that . 
because they have the ambition , i guess . 
simple as that . 
which is good for them , 
but on the other hand , we kind of lose out . 
it 's terrible for us . 
i think that if young people had service to the country might give them more ambition . because they learn that serving other people is a good thing . 
and it can be good for them , too . 
you go to the mall 
i know . 
for what . 
i know . 
give me the money 
and i 'll teach them something good . 
you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house . 
that 's my other complaint . 
parents are n't parents any more . 
they 've relinquished their parenting . 
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble ? 
as a substitute teacher for a year , i can say . 
i talked with somebody else about that another time , 
and when i 's in graduate school working on my master 's degree in math , i was teaching as part of the program . 
and i just love teaching . 
that 's probably the most fun i had . 
and it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently . 
and when , i thought , i 'd like to teach . 
but for what . 
i do n't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life . 
that 's a sad thing to think , 
and that 's kind of selfish on my part , 
and i admit that , 
in a way it is , 
but you have to look out for yourself , 
that 's right . 
that 's wrong . 
i 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less , 
i saying teachers should be paid more . 
. 
they do an absolutely necessary job , 
but there 's a sense of priorities here , too . 
what 's more important , 
picking up the garbage or educating our kids . 
they both have their place . 
that 's pretty good . 
it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone . 
there was a time when unions were needed . 
and they served a good function . 
and they served a good function , 
but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated , 
and they 're only there to perpetuate their own power structure . 
i remember , the company my dad worked for , the people there went on strike against the management . 
it was a steel manufacturing place , 
this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap , 
and they were having a hard time . 
and they told the strikers there , we need you to come back and get this stuff done . 
or else we 're going to be out of business . 
and they would n't come back , 
so they went bankrupt . 
and they all lost their jobs . 
and that 's really what happened to the steel industry in this country . 
so many times you had the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time . 
and that took care of that industry 
that 's right . 
and i 'll tell you , 
and they 're trying to do that now with the imports . 
we 've never caught up , 
and i do n't think we ever will . 
it 'll be a tough road , though . 
here it is , 
and they only did it because they were embarrassed that they 're so good at it . 
that 's about right . 
back to the original subject , 
i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service , 
i do n't care what kind it is . 
it teaches them pride in their country . 
and pride in themselves , too . 
that 's right . 
you could organize something just within your community . 
same old thing . 
that 's right . 
and that 's a great idea . 
i think they ought to take them and just have sort of like a manpower pool and say we need somebody ... 
are you on an exercise program now 
i exercise pretty regularly . 
i lift weights quite a bit . 
i run occasionally . 
let 's see 
what else do i do . 
play golf some , 
and i work out on a hanging bag . 
so i keep up with that a little bit . 
how about you . 
the only exercise program i 'm doing right now is walking . 
i 've got a nine month old , 
and i 'm four months pregnant with my second , 
and so , at the time , walking seems to be the best . 
it 's something i can do with her , plus does n't tax me too physically . 
i have enjoyed aerobics in the past , 
and i enjoy that because i like the group association like exercising with other people . 
and that 's my favorite way to exercise . 
that 's neat . 
i do walk some too . 
my wife 's about five months along 
so she 's been walking quite a bit , 
so that is a good exercise for that . 
it 's nice to do it together , too , i guess . 
my husband and i use to walk together , 
but our schedules do n't coincide as well as they used to , 
and so , we very seldom get together to walk 
but , when you work out , do you pretty much do it on your own schedule , 
or do you go to groups 
i do it on my own schedule . 
but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis , to drive the distance you have to go . 
save the fees , 
we just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment . 
and then you can do it whenever you want i guess . 
i 've got a weight bench , 
and we got my wife an exercise bike , 
and i use that sometimes too . 
it 's a little more convenient , 
but , i guess you 're not as dedicated if you do n't drive over to do it . 
i guess it depends on the person , depends on how motivated you are . 
but , since the first of the year neither one of us have been going . 
so , i guess , like i say , we 've been paying these fees and not going , 
so it 's kind of a waste of money if you do n't take advantage of it . 
i think you really have to be disciplined . 
i try to work out at least a couple of times a week , 
and i think you really have to , at least twice a week , just to maintain the shape that you 're in . 
and i have two friends . 
they have babies that are about the same ages as mine , 
and we 've been walking every morning 
when it was cold we would go to the mall because you ca n't take the babies out very easily . 
but the last little while , for one reason or another , we have n't been real consistent . 
so it 's a little harder when you 're depending on other people to do it with you because you have to meet their schedules as well , 
but i enjoy doing it more when i 've got other people with me . 
i do n't feel obligated to do it . 
i enjoy it . 
if i feel too obligated to do it , i start to rebel , 
and i wo n't be as consistent with it . 
i understand . 
did you exercise between your first child and your second ? 
i exercised pretty well up until i was pregnant , 
and i started having pains . 
so i 've calmed down everything except , i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the walking , 
and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful . 
and i was going to wait until about my sixth month and then start that . 
i did that with the second baby , 
and i went to my exercise class one day , 
and then she was delivered the next day . 
so , it would seem to be real beneficial . 
i think it made parts of it a lot easier . 
and is this your first that you 're having ? 
then i do n't know how much you 've been through it , 
but i think parts of it made . 
and , i 've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and did n't with the other , 
and they said that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier . 
having both of them natural , 
the first one was natural 
and going natural the second , 
and it 's rough 
but it 's not as bad as i thought it would be , 
and i think the exercise helped . 
that 's good . 
my wife has been working with them . 
then she could go if she were interested . 
so she could find out if she wanted to go . 
it 's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy , 
and so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial . 
at least it 's something you enjoy . 
i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say , i do n't want to exercise , 
it 's too much work . 
but there 's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you do n't have to strain yourself or sweat or be real sore afterwards . 
that 's right . 
and sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like , i 've done a good job because i worked myself to that point . 
but have we reached our limit ? 
i 'm not sure how long we 've been talking 
i think we 've talked about six minutes or so . 
it 's been good talking to you . 
been good talking to you as well . 
i hope your baby comes out well . 
i do n't know , 
but we bought a van last year , 
and there were two other couples with us 
and there was , uh , state park . 
and it was really nice . 
up here some of the state parks are really nice 
and some of them are n't , 
some of them are pretty rough . 
they do n't have a shower room or anything , 
but some of them are really nice 
they have showers and full bathrooms , 
but i do n't know , 
a lot of people i know are , 
i like the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that . 
there was n't any electricity on the camp site 
but it was all right , 
we only spent two nights there . 
i would n't want to spend more than two nights . 
i would n't want to go for a week , 
but two nights is good . 
especially there was a little store close by , 
so , it was pretty nice . 
it 's right on a big lake , 
and there 's a lot of boating out there , 
and we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit 
but it was still , too , cold . 
it was pretty early in the year . 
it 's not that bad 
but it 's still pretty chilly . 
i do n't know , 
i have a tent 
and i fluff out in it , in the backyard and stuff , 
it 's dirty , 
so , you ca n't keep the dirt out of the tent . 
i do n't know 
we have a seven year old , 
it 's pretty funny , 
stay out . 
we have a dog 
and that 's just about as bad as a kid . 
they like to play in them . 
i do n't know how you can really keep the inside of a tent clean . 
i do n't know . 
other than taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and sweeping it out everyday , it 's really hard to keep the sand and dirt out of it . 
what we were doing , we were just going to say , we 're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night , 
what he wants to do , was play in the tent . 
it was this is not working , , 
you ca n't do that , 
you get the tent all dirty . 
plus you get it all wet , 
we were at a beach site , too . 
did you have , a big tent , looks like a sitting area type like a two room type ? 
but i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice 
we do n't really have a problem with that in these areas , 
and i noticed that , 
i 've lived back east before , 
they 're terrible , 
they 're really terrible . 
just some of them are known 
but there is one that 's out in this big lake 
and then there 's this other one that 's more up in the mountains 
and there 's no bugs , 
that 's the whole thing that everyone told me , 
i was going to go to , little river state park , 
that place is great , 
there 's no bugs . 
because we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas , 
they 're so , bad . 
it 's a really nice area , 
i 've been there before 
and you can go outside in the daytime , all right , 
just the very second , 
it 's really strange . 
they must work on that , 
it gets cooler when the sun sets 
and then they all come out . 
have you ever taken any of those lights , 
have you ever used those ? 
i never really noticed how effective they were , 
i bought them 
we just sort of lit them . 
so , we did n't really contribute it to that . 
i ca n't see all this little smoke buckets , 
they work , 
but they 're suppose to work really well . 
i 'm in my paperwork here , 
that 's what i do when i wait for a phone call , 
i get in my paperwork . to find my most important parts . 
but i do n't know if i 'm going to go , 
i wish 
and i could really talk about gardening or something , 
you can talk about that a lot , 
but i do want to go again . 
we just moved into a house , 
maybe in the backyard , 
i just got married less than two years ago , 
so , we do n't have any children yet , 
so , it 's easy for you to go . 
we have a van 
and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it . 
i do n't know 
but that sounds , 
it really does . 
that is to have a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it , plus your tent . 
and he 's got three kids , 
so , his kids will sleep in the truck , in the back of the bed . 
those , they 're kind of nice 
but they 're also flimsy when you really look at them . 
but when you get inside they 're really nice , 
it 's 
a storm came in 
everybody was getting stuck in the mud . 
what do you do when you get a really violent storm like a tornado , 
just stay in your truck . 
theirs was so bad , 
and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up , 
and they had to get out of there . 
then , were they successful ? 
they were . 
but it took them a little while ? 
did they get stuck ? 
they ended up getting out . 
they ended up helping several other people though that were stuck . 
so , they evacuated it . 
it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream . 
i know i like to get right on the water , 
i really like them , 
like i say , they 're just kind of more sturdy than anything , 
just , 
they 're pretty nice , 
it 's like a little house except the whole face is open , 
and the one time that , we got one , it was overlooking the water 
i wanted to get one right on the water . 
we had an electrical storm too , 
and it was neat sitting there watching it , 
when we called home , everybody said , we were worried about you in that storm ... 
i think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time . 
how do you feel about it ? 
they do have a major internal problem . 
everybody wants to defect , 
and i can understand why . 
i think their biggest problem is just obtaining food to live , 
so when you have the basic needs being unmet , i do n't think you think globally as far as being a threat to other people in the world . 
so , as soon as they get their own home country taken care of , then they 'll consider , what they can do with the rest of the world . 
i believe communism is very much waning . 
it 's pretty much on the way out of the door , insofar as the strong hold that they used to have , 
if they can get the army , or the military to sway to their side , i think that it will be on the way out eventually . 
and that has n't set too well with their diplomacy regarding the , outcome of their affairs . 
politically speaking he 's going to have more power , 
and i think it 's a step in the right direction . 
he does realize it with the fact that they , increased the prices on their food and goods . 
that 's incredible 
but they had to go in the direction of a market driven economy , 
and they had to bite the bullet for that . 
but i do n't know how convinced the people are of him yet , myself . 
that 's all they got right now . 
that 's their ray of hope . 
so they 'll go with whoever comes through for them . 
and i think he 's got between the old guard , and the new glasnost . 
and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on both sides . 
so i think that 's , kind of where he 's stuck . 
you know what i 'm saying ? 
i understand . 
and that 's the situation that he finds himself in , 
and he 's a tough guy , 
he 's been through it . 
i think overall he 's been a , good figure for the soviet union . 
i think that makes the problem most severe , and makes him look worse that , what his ideals are , personally . 
i agree . 
what 's bad for the soviet system is that , they have the resources to grow and produce their food , but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should . 
i think it 's a lot of bureaucracy and , one thing , and then all the corruption . 
that 's probably more true than , a lot of people realize . 
i know you 're going to have that with every society . 
at least we 're more blatant about it , 
but it 's very secret , 
and it 's been going on for years . 
you ca n't change things overnight . 
but if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive there 's revolution , 
it seems to be headed in that direction too . 
big time , 
major , 
that 's the way the world revolves that way . 
. their knowledge , with better communication processes in this world now that 's reached them is more educated to the ways of the western world , 
i really question , though , how much technology the average soviet is exposed to . 
probably not enough , 
but i 'm sure i lot of it 's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they 're missing out on . 
i think they 're starting to realize , 
i 'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items . 
what we consider just , , normal everyday things to them is real luxury . which is unfortunate for them , 
and of course , most of us , we do n't really appreciate what we 've got because we 've been so used to it . 
this is true . 
this is very true . 
it 's human nature though to take things for granted 
when you 've lost something or do n't have what other people have that 's when you tend to realize what 's out there and what you have and what you do n't have . 
i agree . 
so the original question , 
do we think they 're a security threat ? 
i can go with that answer too . 
i do n't really feel that the soviets really want to blow up the world . 
and they 're people just like us . 
they get up everyday , 
and they put their pants on the same way , 
and they have to eat and everything else , 
i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type . 
have you been talking to males ? 
this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female . 
i was afraid we might get into an argument . 
i guess there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations , for the roles of women 
they may be going to school , or may have elderly parents , or all sorts of other things . 
it seems too me though that women 's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore , the women are spreading themselves thinner , than before . 
i think so . 
i think it 's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days . 
sometimes , i think i am going crazy trying to do it 
do you work outside the home ? 
do you have children ? 
they are getting older now , 
so they are not quite as much of a responsibility 
but they are still there , 
they still take time , 
and i still provide most of the things that go on around the house . 
and for a while i was going to school too , 
and it was tough . 
i think sometimes other things suffer 
i think it 's hard to find a balance there . 
but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all . 
you 're almost looked down upon if you do n't try to do all of these things 
and that 's where the problem is really . 
i have little children , four and one , 
and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home . 
i 'm very active with other people with children my age 
and most of us do tend to stay home , 
but when i run into people that just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time , there 's almost a friction between us . 
not people that are necessarily good friends , even though that has happened too 
it 's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence . 
if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself . 
and if you do n't then , sometimes you feel like you 're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you 're just wasting your time , at home . 
it 's a tough one . 
i 've done some of both . 
when my kids were real little , i was at home for a couple of different periods of time . 
i think the longest was less than a year , 
but still at least i was able to spend those first months with them . 
but i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things . 
the money was the issue . 
but even now , i would like to not have to work in some ways . 
it 's kind of pull and tug , 
on the other hand , i ca n't imagine just being at home although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue . 
still there 's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having a job and all that goes with that . 
that 's definitely true . 
in fact , i work out of my home . 
i 'm an accountant , 
and i do taxes and bookkeeping 
it 's a way for me to stay home . 
but it 's worked out for my family , 
to have my cake and eat it too , kind of thing . 
that 's a good deal . 
where do you think this is going in the future , 
do you think things are going to change , 
i hope that they will change , 
i know it 's going to be a slow change . 
i 'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know . 
i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both , of the parents work . 
i hope to see employer based helping out child care centers at the place of employment and things like that , that will help out . 
what do you think , 
do you think we are , setting a trend ? 
i see some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children . 
and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the family things work . 
but i do n't know if they 're going to ever give up their careers . 
it 's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are , 
i do n't know if they want to completely give that up . 
it 's a very personal thing . 
i think it 's hard though when you talk about families and raising children 
because i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground . 
i think they need security 
i do n't know , 
speaking from my children , they are n't real flexible when it comes to things like that . 
they want to know things are going to be a certain way . 
i think they like a routine of sorts . 
we will see . 
i 'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society . 
i like the fact that gradually you 're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions , 
but it 's still a long way from being what it ought to be . 
the numbers are still very skewed to say the least . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
i have a lot of different teams that i like to keep in touch with , 
what are the others ? 
i have a tendency to , adopt teams when i go to a town . 
it 's helpful . 
so i 've got quite a few . 
do you keep up with the statistical stuff ? 
i do n't get into that too much , 
every once in a while , i will keep in touch , with maybe who 's in the top five of hitting , or something like that 
but i do n't get into how many errors somebody has or things like that . 
there 's a guy that was on show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does , 
it 's essentially trivial statistics 
it 's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games . 
i 've heard of that one . 
i did n't know that , 
that 's supposed to be a real good statistic . 
it is 
but it 's a reverse indicator . 
that 's true , 
they do n't have the offense to get out , or to have the more runs , 
how can you draw a conclusion from it , 
but they find that , there 's a connection between that and how they do in spring training the following year . 
which means that if you have a good year winning one run games that the following year , you 'll have a bad year . 
which i was kind of leaning toward anyway , to tell you the truth . 
i do n't know , 
i kind of think it was necessary , 
i 'm not a big pure power hitter anyway . 
i do n't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time . 
i think that a player ought to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch to do it , 
but when you get two strikes on you , you should shorten your swing a little bit , 
if it 's a perfect shot , go for it , 
plus supposedly what i heard , he was not much of a team player anyway , 
i do n't understand the strategy of how baseball works , 
but it seems that they can sign him tomorrow , 
and he could go in the team the next day , 
and , and they put him in the lineup 
and he hits a home run 
and all of a sudden he becomes a hero . 
that 's true . 
and all he has to do is hit the ball , 
and all he has to do is hit it once . 
he can swing a couple times 
it 's an interesting concept of how they do it . 
but i agree with you 
i think that 's part of what baseball needs more of . 
and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run 
and that 's all the game is . 
there 's another point to that too . 
they said that he was horrible at batting with men on base . 
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run gives you run , obviously . 
but if you ca n't do it with men on base , there 's something definitely wrong , 
you 've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs to be able to score enough runs to be able to win in this day and age , 
they have several pitchers that had badly years last year 
and they 're these cycle pitchers , 
they pitch one year bad , one year good , one beer bad , one year good . 
so he 's very much due for a good year . 
that 's a good question , 
they could very easily take that as a challenge . which is the way most teams naturally do . and , just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them , 
and i watch their sports up there 
and they 're certainly intense about the cardinals 
baseball is their life up there like football is down here i think . 
everybody does . 
that 's true too , . 
i think that 's all that they have . 
it 's on the west side , 
everything 's on the west side . 
out that way , 
and i went and visited him , 
but it is interesting . 
how are the cardinals ? 
i definitely do , 
in fact i 've got family that still lives up there . 
from what i hear from everybody up there , they 're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go . 
but i 've been following spring training 
and they 're one of the best teams in spring training so far . 
is that a good indicator ? 
it can be . 
it really kind of depends on , what they were looking for . 
in other words , if in spring training they were looking at all their kids , like a lot of them do then it really does n't give you any indication . 
but if they were playing the people that they 're going to play , then that might be pretty good indication , 
so it 's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just come out and just won all kinds of games in spring training and then gone on a fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season 
it seems that what you really need to do to win though , is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have real breakthrough years . 
and the question is how do you forecast that , 
you ca n't . 
if you had to bet on who would be in the world series it would be really tough . 
this last year , i 'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years . 
and so they may be even better this year . 
that 's a good question . 
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question . 
they 're doing the right thing , though , 
they are going with their farm system . 
they 're letting their farm system build up and stuff like that 
is there enough money , 
that 's part of it , 
and , his argument is that the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars . 
that 's probably true . 
would you agree with that ? 
considering what i 've seen in the last two seasons , i 'm beginning to agree with that , 
but you do n't have to spend the big money , as far as i 'm concerned to win . 
you just have to spend it if it 's necessary . 
in other words if you 've got a player on your team who 's helping your team , then keep him there . 
do n't let him go away . 
they spent more money , last year than any other team in the league 
and they were toward the bottom of the league . 
so it 's like i said 
spending money does n't guarantee you winning a pennant . 
it really does n't , 
if i owned the team . i think you 'd like them to do well 
you got me . 
i think that there 's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan ca n't go 
and once you do that , you lose everything , 
it 's a little bit like any other sport . 
but how often do you do that . 
that 's the whole point . 
there are so many games in a year that they 've got to have repeat customers . 
they ca n't afford not to , 
their ticket prices are as high as anybody else 's 
it 's a small market 
and yet they attract as many if not more than most , other cities , 
but do n't you think there are older fans there . 
i do n't mean older , 
we 're going to talk about the public school system , what 's wrong with it , or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it , what should be done about it . 
fantastic . 
one thing that pops into my mind real quick is about the funding of , the school system right now . 
evidently that 's a big problem . 
it 's amazing , 
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough to be doing what they 're doing . 
when i was in college i enjoyed teaching , 
and i really enjoyed that 
but i would n't want to go teach high school or junior high , 
all the problems . 
an , you talk about stress and pressure , 
i tell you what , 
and they 're being paid , probably half what most people being paid . 
and we 're paying basketball people millions of dollars a year for what . 
that 's right , 
i just do n't understand that . 
do you have little kids , or what ? 
sure do n't , 
my wife and i 've just been married about two years 
but i have a sister that 's a school teacher , 
my wife and i have a three year old , almost four and a two year old . 
so we 're looking at the older one going to school next year . not this coming fall but the year after that . 
so it 's getting close . 
so we 're thinking about that . 
what 's that going to be like . 
are they going to be taught nothing , 
or they going , 
we 're going to be involved in our child 's education . 
we 're going to be teaching him what we can at home , of course , because i guess we do n't trust the school system , which is very sad , 
but if it does n't start at home , it 's not going to go anywhere . 
that 's true . 
not if you can read or write , or understand some science . 
give me a break , 
that 's bogus . 
and one thing my wife and i 've talked about , are , private schools . 
i could n't believe that . 
we were hoping the school district 's going to be good for resale value , and , so on and so forth , 
but i can definitely see on down the road where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that 's going to be a definite concern . 
you talked before , about the school funding . 
i think there 's only going to be one solution to school funding which i do n't think will be necessarily the best way 
but i think what 's going to have to happen is there 's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids . 
that 's the only way they 're going to fund it , because if they start raising taxes for property , people are going to throw a fit . 
taxes right now are political suicide . 
and i do n't think any politician 's going to do that , 
and the only thing , they would think of would be tuition , 
if it works at colleges it will work down below . 
and that 's going to affect the people that are having kids in school , of course , which is probably the only fair thing to do . 
but , it will be hard for people , that have in school because they have to pay out even more . 
and it 's going to really hurt the middle class people because they 're the ones that will probably have to carry the brunt of the load . 
that 's right . 
that 's just unbelievable to me . 
i ca n't believe that . 
when i was in junior high and high school that never happened . 
you never heard about that . 
we did n't even think about it . 
and now what do we have now . 
got kids that , 
i 'd be afraid to be in school , teaching , or even being a student 
and think what 's it going to be like for my oldest son , when he goes to school . 
what 's going to happen ? 
i 'm afraid for him to go . 
but there again , you ca n't hold them back . 
and you want to encourage them to be active and everything in school , 
but with all the peer pressure that 's going on , with all the negative things it 's a tough environment to be growing up in . 
and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school , 
so . that was twelve years ago , i guess . 
so it 's lot different now . 
and what 's it going to be like in another twelve years when my oldest son is in high school . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
i 'm afraid to even think about it . 
that is a scary thought , 
but i do n't know , 
i guess what you have to do is just keep encouraging them and , try to be open with them , so that you can deal with the problems as they come up . 
that 's all you can do . 
still you got to be their best friend because when they 've got problems , who they going to go to , 
their friends that are dealing drugs , or your parents . 
and if they go to their friends dealing drugs , they 're going to be in even worse shape . 
that 's right . 
and the schools do n't really encourage to stay away from that , 
they do n't teach them good values like drugs are bad . 
maybe i 'm wrong , because i have n't been in that kind of environment for a long time , 
but , it just is amazing , 
need to teach them good values . 
that 's true , 
that 's true , 
of course , if i say this is a good value , someone else is going to stand up and say , . 
and i think you touched on it , 
you 've got to start them at the home . 
that 's where they get the deep rooted values 
and that 's about right . 
that 's all you can do . 
that 's right . 
i got to be going , 
i appreciate the call . 
nice talking to you today . 
you to . 
have a good life . 
i do n't , 
so i can work at home . 
and it 's just an old compact , that is super slow 
but it does its job , 
what processor does it have in it ? 
i do n't know , 
it 's so old . 
what kind of work do you do on it ? 
i do television ratings 
and i process some ratings and do graphics for their television stations their clients , 
it 's basically just data entry and running some software 
so it does n't really have to be anything sophisticated . 
my husband does , too , 
i have , a fairly fancy one , 
the job that i do , i do a lot of training of our customers for new products . 
and i have to develop functional specs and desk top publishing and everything , 
so it 's kind of fun , 
i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house 
but i just have n't got around to doing it yet . 
i 'd like to have one for the house , too , 
but sometimes my husband says usually , i work on the computer all day at work , 
i do n't want to come home and have to work on one , too . 
your husband , what group is your husband in ? 
something with the defense . 
defense systems and electronics group ? 
something like that , 
they 've changed their name so many times i 've lost track , 
i see . 
i work on printers and , the peripheral products division , basically , 
i work in the airline , marketing group . 
i did n't even know they had anything like that . 
i learned so many things that they do , 
they 're into so many different things , 
he had , one of those top secret things where he could n't talk about what he did , 
for a while 
but then he switched jobs . 
i do n't understand half the stuff he does 
is he a programmer ? 
i see . 
software design engineer , as they call it , 
but i have a degree in information management , which is computer , 
it 's basically , more the business end of it than the programming end of it . 
but i 've been at it for five years , 
so . everything 's changed so much i probably could n't even get a job right now . 
it seems like it 's changed so much , 
so they 've made such advances in computers , 
so does your husband ever use a laptop or a notebook ? 
does he bring a little one home with him 
sometimes he brought home a portable one , 
but it quit working 
so he , brought it back 
and he just has n't brought another one home . 
but they did give him a new computer at work , 
i see . 
we build laptop and notebook computers here in temple also . 
and those are really handy , 
how nice , 
he does n't have one of those , 
what 's that ? 
he does n't have one of those . 
they 're pretty handy because when i travel , it 's easy to check messages , 
just plug in the phone to your computer and dial in 
my husband does n't have to travel , 
that 's good . 
some people enjoy the travel 
but i do n't think i 'd like it , if he traveled a lot . 
i see . 
i would love to have a computer , 
but they 're so expensive . 
i do n't know , 
depends on what you consider expensive , 
you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars , where just a few years ago it would have been six , seven , eight , nine thousand dollars . 
, i guess it 's , inexpensive compared to what it used to be 
but it 's a lot to put into one . 
two thousand dollars is n't just pocket change to a lot of people . 
that 's right . 
it 's not . 
it 's not pocket change , 
so it 's major . 
when they start needing something then that will be different 
i remember that . 
i had to do some of my husband 's papers because i had access to one 
but his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing , 
i did a lot of his papers . 
they come in real handy , 
how many different types of packages do you use ? 
at home ? 
the packages i do n't really use , 
most of it 's just stuff that 's been written in house that i use . 
i know those two . 
you probably use or something like that , for your data entry stuff that you 're , talking about . 
a lot of the data entry stuff they used , uh , survey system and , just in-house programs to do what they needed . 
i worked for this company before i had my first daughter , 
and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things , 
that worked out pretty good then . 
it did . 
i really do n't do a lot of what i used to do , 
i just do something really minor 
but , it 's something that nobody else wants to do , 
and it 's time consuming . 
so , it keeps you in the company ? 
that 's right , 
it gives me a paycheck , 
the work . goes for three to four weeks three times a year , 
it 's not something that 's continual because the television ratings do n't come out all the time . 
they only come out four times a year , 
i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here , i 'd get all kinds of stuff done . 
phone 's always ringing 
and , people always asking me to do something else . 
especially right now , we 've got several new products coming out , 
and i 've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise . 
will they let you take a computer home to work ? 
but i need to be at the office , too . 
i 've just got to deal , with all those other things that happen 
i bet . 
and it was looking a little touchy to meet , 
i 've done that before , a couple times . 
but that would make it just that much easier 
instead of bringing home a computer , you just bring home a few floppy disks . 
that 's right . 
because it 's real nice with this because i do n't even have to go into the office 
i 've maybe been into the office once in the past three years . 
they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever , 
that sounds really nice . 
it is real nice , 
i just deal with them on the telephone , 
half the people do n't even know who they 're talking to . 
i know most of them , 
i ca n't say that , 
a lot of people changed around there 
but , most people know who i am , 
but i do n't know who they are . 
a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice . 
i 've got a lot of folks that i 've worked with like that as well . 
you just know them by the telephone , 
it 's been good talking to you , 
i think we 've got the subject . 
we sort of stayed to the topic anyway . 
we tried . 
it 's hard to sometimes . 
we 'll talk to you later . 
that made a nice ugly sound . 
sounds like you like to read . 
i read quite a bit , probably do n't read as much as i would like to . 
i do n't read as much as i would like to either . 
i 'm a single mom , 
but i have always loved reading . 
what do you like to read ? 
so most of my books are what you 'd call self improvement type of books . 
that . 
my interests switch around dramatically . 
i used to read just , mainly fiction , 
and now like a said , i 've read a lot of self help books . 
what kind of things have you read ? 
i read all kinds of things for helping people survive a divorce . 
have you read that ? 
i have n't gotten through it yet . 
you have n't ? 
what would you recommend ? 
as far as dealing with divorce ? 
i 'm kind of getting that one past me , 
but a good self help book . 
good self help . 
that sounds good . 
and it 's one that we use in our work . 
i do n't know what the chains are down there . 
maybe in the mall family book store , something like that . 
i 'm writing it down . 
that sound really good . 
what kind of counseling do you do , 
or should we stay on the topic of books ? 
probably should stay on the topic , 
but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read . 
so i see a lot of kids with various problems . 
right now some of the things i 'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse , 
so a lot of the books i 've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues . 
i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves 
they 're at a bad stage anyway , 
and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible , as a teen . 
that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that . 
sometimes it 's rewarding , 
and sometimes it 's a struggle . 
i 'm sure , 
i 'm sure . 
is that just the only type of reading you 've been doing , 
or have you read any good novels lately ? 
i guess i 've got so many books like that that i need to read 
it 's hard for me to do a lot of reading just for enjoyment . 
just joy reading . 
i hear you there , 
that 's for sure . 
in fact , 
and i just realized i had never read it growing up . 
so , i just finished reading that for enjoyment . 
that 's neat . 
and it was good . 
she , did n't enjoy it much , 
so i did n't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her . 
but i thought it was real interesting . 
i 've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college because i enjoyed some of those stories so much , 
but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading . 
i know . 
i trying to think of some of my other favorite books , 
but , i keep lists , 
i must have a list of two hundred , three hundred books that i want to read . 
just i want to read that 
and i write it down . 
i 've got a stack next to my bed . 
so do i . 
i tend to get a little bit of ways in a book 
and then i get distracted , , or have to start on another one , 
it 's pretty tough to keep up with . 
but i was trying to think , 
he also wrote people of the lie . 
that 's the one i was thinking of . 
i bought that one , 
and i did n't get involved in that one as well . 
there 's another one he wrote that even sounds better , 
and it 's kind of the whole concept of global peace and building communities . 
someone just recently said something really neat about that . 
i got involved in beginning experience weekends , 
and it was that said that . 
his latest book is just excellent , 
and his whole idea is , we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects . 
and he did mention beginning experience weekends as one of the places . 
that 's interesting . 
it really was . 
i ca n't think of his name . 
pardon me 
it 'll come to me , 
but he wrote the illusion , and a bridge to forever . 
those are mind expanding books . 
his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of . 
i ca n't think of what his name is right off the bat , though . 
but they were fun . 
they were real just books for fun . 
not very long . 
i really just started . 
how did you get involved ? 
i see . 
i just recently quit . 
and so i got myself involved in a sales job , 
and right now , my list of books to be read have to do with the art of selling . 
, i was just thinking , 
so , i keep getting stacks of books i need to read , 
and , i do n't know when i 'm going to get to them all . 
never , 
never 
there 's never going to be enough hours in the day . 
i do n't think so . 
even if you took speed reading . . 
i do n't think so . 
do you like to read mysteries . 
a little bit . 
. trying to think . 
he writes spy novels , the eye of the needle 
and i really have found his books enjoyable . 
i like that kind of stuff . 
i think the last novel i read i read , in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year . 
it 's called this present darkness . 
it 's kind of unusual book . 
that sounds interesting . 
it sounds really good . 
you should make yourself a promise that you 'll read one novel in the next six months , just for you . 
it 's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work , or self improvement , 
and you kind of forget the fun of reading . 
that 's true . 
very easily . 
i guess we 've covered the topic pretty thoroughly . 
i think so , too . 
and i thank you for calling . 
and i 'll have to check out that book you , told me about . 
hope you like it . 
thank you . 
you take care . 
you , too . 
and then i read a lot . 
i like to read , too . 
i was trying to think of some while it was talking about it , 
it took so long for someone to answer , 
i started reading the newspaper , and kind of forgot about it . 
but 
i live in a pretty small apartment , 
and i would have to put stuff away . 
i have two cats , 
so i could n't really leave it out if i was working on something . 
reading is a little bit easier to work around . 
you can pick it up and take it wherever you go . 
that 's right . 
i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing . 
that 's true , 
i do the same thing . 
you get so involved in what you 're reading . 
i do n't have the equipment here . 
and i did some of that . 
what else have i done ? 
things to hang on the wall . 
mostly just stuff that i can use right around the house or give away as gifts . 
and i still remember how to do it . 
it 's just been so long since i 've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that . 
and i enjoy doing that . 
it 's just the same old thing , 
it 's just getting the time to do it . 
but i never count right , 
and i always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or something . 
it never has worked out completely . 
it takes a lot of concentration . 
and i also made a little thing for a baby gift , 
you must pay all attention to what you 're doing . 
it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be . 
it took me quite a bit of time . 
i though , this wo n't take long at all . 
but i was wrong . 
it took a while to do . 
but , it was fun , 
i enjoyed it . 
the first project i started out one was a big one , 
it was of a lady 
it was just too much to start with . 
and i still have n't finished it , because i stopped , 
and i thought i better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to get it done . 
and , it was just too much to begin with . and kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it . 
that 's pretty understandable . 
but it does n't have the specific stitches . 
it 's a little bit more loose , and not quite as structured , 
and i like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that . 
more like embroidery or something . 
i 'm trying to think of anything else i do as a hobby . 
i was tonight , 
i was reading when you called . 
how about movies , 
do you like to go to movies ? 
i do , 
i do like to go to movies , 
so i like to rent movies , 
and right now i have the movie channel , 
so i 've recorded quite a few movies off of that . 
just , i 've kind of got a collection going of tapes now , 
and whenever i go visit my parents , they 're always saying , bring some of your tapes . 
they always borrow a few of them . 
i was over there , 
and they said , bring some tapes with you . 
so they are always borrowing my tapes . 
i like to do stuff with plants . 
i have a lot of plants in my apartment , 
and i 've got a pretty small porch , 
but have n't done that yet . 
i kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time , 
but i think we 're probably past that now . 
i probably should go buy some . 
i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening , some . 
i 'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that . 
it 's the hard work . 
i like the planting , 
and watering is okay . 
it 's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers , 
we live in an apartment also . 
i 've got a few plants here , 
but i 'm not really knowledgeable . 
i feel real good if i water them 
and they continue to grow . 
i feel like , i 've accomplished something . 
so i enjoy it , 
but i 'm just not experienced enough with it . 
i do n't know too much about it either . 
mine 's pretty limited to my little porch plants . 
and then the ones in my apartment , half of which do n't look real healthy , 
but i do n't always get direct sun except in certain spots . 
and so that 's probably my problem there . 
have you tried growing any , fruits and vegetables or anything ? 
they 're pretty big , 
and i have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area , 
but my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house . 
and i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff . 
but i 've never really tried anything like that since then . 
i considered it last year and this year both , 
but i have n't done anything about it . 
so . i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch . 
we get lots of sunlight here , 
and it 's pretty large . 
so i think if i 'd do something , be motivated enough to do something it would work out well . 
but there goes that motivation thing again . 
i enjoy playing with my cats . 
i do n't know if you 'd call that a hobby , 
but i have two cats , 
and i gave them a bath tonight , 
so they 're a little bit angry at me . 
can you put them right in the water ? 
they did n't like it too much . 
that 's good , 
and it helps because it 's the time of the year that they 're shedding a lot , and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine . 
so i thought , this 'll help them shed , 
so , they 're pretty content now , 
but they were mad at me for quite a while . 
i like animals , 
but we do n't have any yet . 
we have a nine month old with another on the way 
or get into a house with a little more space . 
i 'd love to have some animals . 
but i like dogs 
and my husband likes cats . 
so we have n't reached a real agreement on that yet . 
if we get a place where we can have both , it 'll be great , 
i like both , 
but since i 'm in an apartment , i do n't think an apartment is big enough for a dog . 
to me , dogs need a yard , even little dogs . 
they just need a yard . 
cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine . 
but i just think dogs need to be outside , though . 
i agree with you . 
if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat , or even a bird or a fish tank or something small 
that 's an idea 
that she can watch , but wo n't take too much care . 
because , even a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something . 
they 're not as likely to as a dog might , i guess . 
and if i was a cat or dog , i 'd respond probably by biting or something . 
i do n't know . 
that 'd be my self defense . 
but i think we probably reached our time limit . 
probably 
and i 'm out of good ideas for a hobby anyway . 
it was good talking to you . 
thank you for calling . 
it still echoes . 
do you like to cook ? 
i love it . 
i do too . 
it 's kind of hard to find time sometimes 
do you work ? 
and have a family ? 
i do n't have a family , 
and , by the time i get home i 'm so tired it 's hard to cook a full meal . 
i expect so . 
for a dinner party , i think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine . 
so . where did you get your recipe for it ? 
i guess mostly out of an international cookbook that i have . 
and the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes , 
once a month , they 'll put out a recipe of the month . 
and they put this one out 
and i tried it 
and it was really good . 
and it 's a red wine . 
and i 'm trying to think what else . 
and , then i rub the chicken with a little bit of oil , and pour the wine sauce over it the last twenty minutes , so that it gets just enough flavor . 
and then you put wine over it . 
that sounds real good . 
and , it 's really easy too 
what do you use ? 
what do you serve with it ? 
what do you serve with it ? 
i like to serve a wild rice with it . 
that 's what i do too . 
this is really neat . 
that 's what i 've got . 
i just do n't think you can go wrong with something like that . 
it 's great . 
i 've got a good dessert recipe . 
what ? 
i just break it up in a glass bowl , 
what time should we be there ? . 
that sounds wonderful . 
it is , 
it 's great . 
i try to avoid making anything too fancy , that , we 'd like too much and eat too much . 
i know what you mean . 
so you make it like a pizza crust , 
you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice 
and i ca n't remember what else is in it 
and you make kind of a glaze , 
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that . 
and pour that over it ? 
that sounds great . 
it is really good , 
and it 's real light 
it would be pretty . 
depending on the fruit you use it 's real colorful . 
that would be pretty . 
we 've been cooking a lot of , turkey breasts . because it 's low fat . 
it 's just so much better for you . 
and i 've been making a hot sandwich . 
and then i make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it , and pop it in the microwave . 
that sounds great . 
it is delicious . 
i would n't mind serving that to anybody . 
and that 's something that just it does n't take a long time to fix , 
it 's really good , 
and it 's really good for you . 
it 's real quick . 
and we eat out a lot 
and there are sometimes you just do n't feel like eating out , 
i mix it until it just tastes good to me . 
i was going to say , do you just mix it to taste ? 
and it 's real good . 
and it keeps in the refrigerator . 
how long , does it keep , 
it keeps a long time . 
and you would n't have to mix that much together even . 
it keeps a long time . 
i 'm sorry i keep coughing . 
i 've had a bad cold . 
plain ? 
i 'll bet that is really good . 
it makes a great sandwich . 
i 'm going to have to think of that . 
we 're getting company tonight , 
are you . 
that 's kind of hard . 
they 'll eat fish ? 
she 'll eat fish . 
and it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables , to make up for the lack of meat . 
that sounds good . 
do you garden or not ? 
we do n't , 
our next door neighbors do 
and a lot of times they 'll give us something . 
and i put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty . 
and everybody loves it 
and it 's so easy , 
and it 's delicious . 
that 's what i was just thinking , 
it does n't sound like it would be hard at all . 
it is n't . 
where did you get this cook book ? 
i got it at the checkbook store . 
and , it 's got all these beautiful pictures , in there that are inspiring . 
the creative cooking course . 
i might have to visit the state book store . 
i 'm trying to see who it 's published by , 
i 've never heard of it . 
i have n't either . 
this edition is published by bonanza books . 
it 's a big book 
but it was not expensive . 
i 've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken , 
we do too . 
and we do eat a lot of pasta . 
we just said the other night it would n't be too difficult to do without red meat . 
that 's right . 
i do n't think it would . 
we do n't have that much of it now . 
as long as we have plenty of vegetables , and lots of chicken . 
i stir fried some the other night though . 
it was good , 
but it did n't have much beef in it . 
we used to stir fry a lot , 
especially a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes . 
it just takes the time to cut everything up . 
but usually if i take a day off or on the weekend especially , i try to cook , real food . 
cook . 
and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead . 
so that we can have those to enjoy . 
have you ever seen any put out by junior leagues ? 
cause , we have some local ones . 
they are great . 
and we have a share alike column in the paper , where people write in and share recipes or write in and say i 'm looking for this recipe , 
and that 's where i get a lot of my recipes . 
they are usually good are n't they ? 
and i got a real good one from a doctor 's office one time . 
is that right , 
what was that ? . 
it 's a baked bean recipe . 
and let 's see , 
you buy the canned baked beans ? 
and , you can add hamburger if you want , to give it a little more body . 
that sounds good . 
so , i try to always keep my eyes open because a lot of time you can find really good recipes where you would n't even think about it . 
so , i try to always keep a little notebook in my purse . 
what basketball teams are you interested in ? 
of course i try to follow my alma mater , 
but they do n't have much of a team usually . 
they 're more of a football team than they are basketball team . 
you never see them on nationally basketball . 
that 's true . 
i do n't think i 've ever seen them nationally on basketball . 
last year they had a really good team , 
that was about five , six years ago by now . 
that 's not too bad . 
and they usually lose in the first round . 
how about you ? 
is it the bulls you 're talking about ? 
as far as college teams i know it 's really easy to say , 
but i 've been pulling for duke for about four years now 
is that right ? 
but they 're on probation this year 
so you ca n't do much about that . 
did you watch the final four this year ? 
i watched all three games of that . 
every game ? 
so it was real nice to have the teams that were there . 
they seemed to think they were better than everybody else 
and maybe they were , 
but i was real happy to see them get knocked off . 
i watched that game . 
and it was a good game . 
it was a very close game , and hard fought game . 
i do n't know , 
but , as far as playing together as a team that day , duke seemed to have them off balance . 
are n't they more of a running gun team ? 
they play the pro style , is , what i 've always called it . 
they shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed 
i do n't know if they were necessarily behind , 
but they were n't ahead as much as they normally are . 
and that meant that they had to play a second half 
and they 've not had to do that all year 
they did n't have to go through some tough games during the year 
so that 's a terrible time to have to deal with that , when it counts so much . 
that 's right . 
and that had to help them a lot . 
i think that probably was the difference in that game . 
because it really could have gone either way . down to the end . 
i do n't know . 
probably not . 
but i do n't think he 's really been a super star for them . 
he to me is not a center , 
he 's more of a real tall forward . 
they 'll make it , 
that 's going to be a war . 
that sure is . 
it 's going to be a great series . 
i think that 's going to be one of those that 's won by the home team , 
whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think . 
one of those two will probably be in there , 
let me see , 
so , i do n't know , 
so that might help them . 
that 's true . 
they say he 's starting to play , 
but he 's been kind of up and down all year . 
one game he 'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in 
and then the next time he ca n't seem to hit the side of a barn . 
so , i do n't know , 
i 'm not sure about him this year . 
last i 've heard is that he 's starting to peak right now . 
that 's when , you do it . 
he 's , starting to be more consistent at the right time of the year . 
the dark horses , 
against any team he would dominate , 
that 's right . 
that 's true . 
then , he 's gone now 
so , they do n't have to worry about that . 
for awhile anyway . 
i thought he was gone period . 
i did n't read the story , 
that might have been what it was , 
maybe i misunderstood what they meant . 
. if they did , they 'd still have to pay his contract . 
they may have done it . 
you never know . 
it was a lot of money . 
that 's what he was being paid , 
he was n't even playing . 
what a good job he had . 
that 's what i think . 
he ruined his sweet position . 
it 's coming up , is n't it . 
l a , 
who 's the other one that 's doing so well this year , 
they have the seeing eye . 
what do they have 
or they 're not brothers , 
i forget how that works . 
but like i said they 're doing extremely good right now . 
i do n't think there 's any clear pick . 
when it 's on the line . 
when it 's on the line , they seem to find a way , 
so , those are what makes a champion i guess . 
that 's true . 
it 's been nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
take care . 
take care . 
are you there ? 
there , 
had to mess with my phone here . 
do you have children ? 
i have one . 
how about you ? 
i have three . 
do you work ? 
i do . 
i do , 
i work 
so he 's not quite two and a half yet . 
i kind of had different ideas from what probably the majority of people have , 
i put him in a day care center from the very beginning . 
he started in day care when he was eight weeks old . 
i do n't know , 
i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people , 
i have had this real problem with a private individual . 
i kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with private individual , when the door shuts , that one person has total control , 
and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around , 
and if you get one bad apple , there are at least other people that can see it . 
they can watch , 
and i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less . 
how can you help depending on the day care center , 
you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers , 
have you ever noticed they 're always a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it kind of thing . 
it 's a family thing . 
you never hear about it really in the big ones . 
so , that 's what i did 
and i have had just excellent luck . 
i have been just so happy . 
but obviously you do 
or you would n't have him there , i know , 
he was in the same center for the first two years , 
and it was wonderful , 
and i loved it , 
and i was so happy there 
and the woman who owned it sold it . 
but , i thought i 'm going to keep an open mind here , 
and the people who came in , it , just was n't the same 
was n't the same . 
and their attitude and philosophy was just completely , opposite from mine , 
and i left him there for about a month and just decided i ca n't do this anymore , 
and i , moved him , which was an extremely traumatic experience 
but , he 's done well , 
was it ? 
he 's been there , a couple of months now , 
and i just feel so lucky . 
that 's great , 
that 's good . 
how about you ? 
do you work 
or do you get to stay home with them ? 
i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years . 
my oldest one is ten and a half now , 
was about ten years . 
so i was really happy that i was able to do that . 
that 's what i wanted to , because i just could n't wait to have kids 
and so , if , i was so anxious to have them and i could n't wait to have them it would be kind of silly to go back to work as soon as i had them , 
so , it was really great . 
by the end of the ten years i was really ready , to go back to work , 
i bet . 
and my youngest was only two and a half . 
she was already two and a half , 
so she was n't an infant . 
a baby . 
so , i felt real good about that , 
but i tell you with summer coming up i 'm just pulling my hair out , in terms of what i 'm going to do , 
i guess i , went back to work about a year and a half ago 
and i worked full time all last year 
and now i 'm going to school part time and graduate school , 
and i 'm working part time . 
i know how that goes . 
i 'm still going full time , 
but i only have half time salary , 
did you have them in a center or something last summer ? 
we did , 
we had all different things , 
we sent them to camp . 
one , 
one , my daughter went home to visit my mom for a while 
and my son went to camp 
forget what else we did 
but it was all really expensive . 
that stuff is expensive . 
it really is . 
so they 're a year older , 
and my son will be , nine and a half . 
i think i can leave them home , 
if i can work part of the day i 'm going to leave them home . 
i was going to say they 're getting to the age where , you should be able to trust that a little bit , 
in fact i 'm doing that right now with their afternoons , when they get home before i do , 
that 's okay . 
but , the four year old i have had her before i went back to work really , in a home day care situation , 
and we 've just been really thrilled , with it too . 
to find the right one , 
that 's what we have to do though . 
but , i was n't embarrassed to shop around , 
there 's an association here in town of professional home , care providers or something like that . 
where do you live ? 
and they have a number you can call 
care provider . 
care provider . 
she goes to seminars 
that 's wonderful . 
and they have weekly meetings and everything 
and , so it 's just really , really well regulated . 
that 's great . 
and , she 's just great . 
and she says this is it , , 
i 'm not going to have her anymore 
and i said , do n't count on that . 
but , we 've tried everything 
my son was eight at the time , just barely eight , 
i 've heard that , they were very good . 
that 's why we picked it , because they were supposed to be real great , 
and i think they were fine , 
but the thing is he was in school all day , in second grade , 
and then there would be a whole ton of other kids , all in the same room , 
you know what fun they had with these computer games 
and then they 'd go outside for awhile , 
but , it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty . 
poor kid was in school all day . 
because he was always around with a crowd of kids 
and he just really missed being able to be by himself , and having some peace and quiet 
even at that age they need that time , 
we all need that time , just some quiet time to wind down from the day . 
that 's exactly it . 
i think that 's really important , 
we both think of that as just so important , to get him involved in stuff like that 
it is . 
and , you could hardly wait , 
it is . 
he 's so much fun now , 
he 's really starting to get lots of fun 
and i ca n't wait until stuff like that starts happening 
i bet , 
and to know what he was doing and enjoy it , 
and it was so much fun 
and he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant 
and he got up on this elephant all by himself 
and i could n't believe it . 
they had so much fun . . 
that 's great . 
i bought us tickets and stood there in line 
and i thought , i 'm going to end up on this elephant with him , . 
he did it by himself , 
good for him . 
so stuff like that is starting to come along where it 's really , getting fun . 
day care has just done just incredible stuff with him 
and he comes home with something new everyday 
and so , i know they 're working with him 
that 's great . 
that 's so good . 
and he goes running , 
he 's out of there . 
and he 's always having fun when i pick him up 
so 
whenever you say bright steps , everybody goes , i 've heard that 's the best day care in town , 
and it 's one of those that 's very hard to get into . 
it was ridiculous . 
and , she 's got two day cares within three blocks of each other . 
she knows what she 's doing , 
that makes such a difference . 
it makes a huge difference . 
that 's the way it is at my daughter 's nursery school too . 
and i think that really makes a difference . 
they 're in it because it 's a profession , not because it 's a job they could get because they did n't qualify for anything else . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
and the owner , i really liked her 
and she worked really hard to get good people , 
but the people that she got were there because they were n't qualified to do anything else . 
and i got lucky 
and all of his teachers were , very good . 
sometimes that 's fine , 
that 's great . 
sometimes it is n't . 
is it real expensive then ? 
it just went up the first of this month . 
it 's a little high , 
so there 's quite a little jump there , 
and there were places that were cheaper , 
your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money , 
and i have peace of mind , where he is 
and some of those other places i would n't have . 
that 's exactly it . 
we do the same thing , 
but she 's gone three mornings . 
but , i said to her , 
when school holidays come around , i used to have such a problem with that . 
they would n't have anything to do . 
have you ever had a family reunion ? 
and let me tell you 
this is a really neat thing to do too , that they did , 
i did n't do it . 
some of the other people , the older people organized it . 
and , what they did , they had a book made up 
and , then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family . like , how many kids you had , and who you had married , 
and it went through , 
and it showed who my husband 's parents were and , who he married and then how many children we had and then his brothers and sisters 
and it went through the whole family and stuff . 
that 's so neat . 
and , it was so good . 
but it really did , , 
and plus it 's got a lot more people interested in it because , you got to participate sort of . 
so did everybody send in their information 
and they made a book up , about it , 
and then you could get it at the reunion . 
and , everybody got a book , that came to the reunion . 
and it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had 
and it just kept coming on up through the generations . 
so , that was really neat . 
that is neat . 
so , do you have a big family ? 
he does . 
he does ? 
he does , 
i do n't . 
but he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any . 
that 's kind of how my husband and i are . 
i have a kind of a big family 
and he just has himself and his brother and his parents , 
and that 's it . 
so , he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together . 
that 's what happened when i first met my husband . 
i said , this ca n't be , 
nobody can have this many relatives , 
because a lot of them lived in a group down one highway . 
and , there was a lake , 
and they all lived down there by it . 
how nice . 
and , so , we were going down , the highway , 
and he kept saying , this is where my uncle lives 
and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle , 
and i kept thinking , this guy is putting me on . 
nobody has this many relatives . 
but , they really were all there . 
how funny . 
but you had a choice 
and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too , and get a lot of good recipes . 
everybody might not like that . 
not be able to do it . 
so , did people come from out of town to the reunion 
they did . 
they came from all over . 
did you put them up in other people 's houses 
or did you have hotel rooms , 
or , how did you do it ? 
they just stayed with different ones of them . 
they did . 
and then , they had it . 
it had gotten so big that they had it at the church . 
and , they had a church service ahead of it , , 
and then they ate out on the ground . 
how nice . 
and they just brought food with them ? 
did they just have over a weekend ? 
is that how they did it ? 
i do n't think my family is as big as your husband 's . 
i do n't think we 'd need a whole church , 
but the problem is we are all really scattered , around . 
there is n't any one place where most of us live , 
so if we ever had a reunion , we 'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel . 
there would be one person who lived there that would have a house , 
but they could n't put everybody up . 
so i think it would get kind of expensive . 
but , you know what you can do ? 
about the same distance for all of you all to come ? 
they have these places where you can rent them 
it 's a big place , 
it 's got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff , 
and , it 's not very expensive that way . 
i see , 
so everybody could stay together ? 
they have a convention type thing . 
a house or something . 
and , then it has little rooms off of it where you 'd go and sleep at night time . 
that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together , than if you all were in your own hotels or something . 
and then , every time you wanted to go eat with somebody , you 'd probably have to go or something . 
it would run into a lot of money . 
that sounds like fun . 
what you can do is , you can write different places , the chamber of commerce , tell them what you 're interested in . 
ask them what they have at area lakes and all . if they have something like that 
because now every time we plan anything , just about , we write to the chamber of commerce of where we 're going because , you can find out so much easier , that way , than try to locate it , 
calling different places can really run you up a bill . 
you ca n't get it exact usually , 
and then everybody goes to that place . 
and that is not bad at all . 
that does n't cost you as much . 
that would be great . 
that would be really nice . 
that sounds good . 
now we had one , 
this was before i lost a lot more of my family , 
but it was n't any of my immediate family anyway . because i did n't have any of them left . 
but they had thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat . 
this was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant . 
i did n't like that much . 
was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite . 
did you have to draw a line , 
or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line ? 
whoever , wanted to come . 
what they did was , they wrote to all the initial people the oldest ones . 
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones . 
i think there was four or five different people , that would call some of them , if they did n't have their addresses and all on them , 
and they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information , we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming . 
and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring . 
i see . 
that 's the reason it ended up in a church because there was just so many of them . 
but , it turned out so much better like that . because they knew ahead of time how many people to expect . 
that would just be a few . 
but how about because of divorce and stuff like that ? 
my parents are divorced , 
i do n't know . 
if you wanted them both to come , then you would have put that down on the list 
and you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them , and ask for their information . 
to send back to those other people . 
i 'm kind of in control over who comes . just from my family . 
then , they sent their little things to us . 
it was up to me , whether i wanted my kids and any of my family to come . 
i see . 
i see , 
that 's a pretty good idea to do it that way . 
so there really was n't a problem that way . 
that 's a real good idea . 
but , i tell you what , 
i bet . 
course we 've still got it 
and they charged us five or six dollars that we paid for the book to be printed . 
and it 's not a hard back book , 
it has everybody that you could ever imagine , and some you could n't . 
how neat . 
i know , 
that 's really neat . 
that 's really neat . 
and , it will be something my kids will have . 
i was just thinking of that . what you could tell your kids . 
i do n't know if you 're like me , 
but i know very little about before my grandparents . 
very , very little about it . 
the thing is i know a lot of stories , 
but i ca n't remember who it was about . 
my grandparents told us when i was growing up and even when i was an adult 
but i remember these stories 
but i have no idea who it was that was in those stories . 
i could n't tell my kids what those people were like , 
i just remember they had some funny stories , 
but i do n't know who it was . 
but then usually when you find out some information from your parents , then you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these , 
what do you usually wear to work ? . 
i am basically retired now . 
i was in education and in administration , 
so basically i wore dresses . and heels , 
and i because my work often took me into court never was one that got accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work . 
but that was just me . 
i know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants . 
i guess i was just old enough not to be very comfortable in it . 
how about you ? 
and they do n't really have , uh , dress code , so to speak there . 
you can pretty much wear whatever you want to , 
and i wear anything from jeans , when i 'm feeling really casual to suits and dresses when i 'm meeting with a customer 
or , i teach training classes , 
and so when i 'm teaching a class , obviously i wear a suit or dress , 
and when it 's really cold i 'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters , or that type of thing . 
but it just really depends on the weather and my mood 
and then obviously when i 'm doing anything that i 'm in front of people , or making presentations , teaching , whatever . i 'm going to dress up more . 
and i think that does make a difference , 
because when you do have to be in front of people i think the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and , more classical style of clothing . 
there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work . 
they 're pretty strict about that , though . 
jeans are n't exactly professional 
maybe it 's just because of the sexist views and everything 
i do n't know , 
i have seen a few people do it though , 
and they were n't overly revealing . 
they were pretty much in good taste , 
for me i just , would n't want to do that . 
there are some that are really short 
and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee . 
that 's what i 've seen . 
and again it depends upon the size , the shape of the person , as well as the shape of the person 's legs . 
even though i retired from education i do modeling 
and i teach at a modeling agency here . 
even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers , in my class . 
and i always try to emphasize the , clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad , 
and then you 're in the situation where you 're very unhappy . 
i feel like too , on the job , when there 's men around and some of the managers are men , you do n't want them looking at your legs necessarily . 
that 's right . 
and to me i just would n't feel comfortable in that at work , 
i have to agree with that , 
even when they was very , very popular in the early sixties , 
we had no regulation against it 
and a lot of the kids did of course , 
and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers . 
and so , i think i do not like to see , in the corporate areas all the women dressed like men , with the suits and white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same . 
i do n't like that , 
even with the very tailored look of a suit , sometimes i like to have just a little something that 's feminine . 
you do n't want to over do it 
but , just a little , a touch of it just to say , i am a woman , 
but i can be professional too . 
i think that you make of that what you wish 
because that was one thing i always fought against . 
i started out as a physical education teacher . 
and that pleased me , 
and so , then i , of course , just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work 
and i find even at home here now , , i will wear blue jeans or i 'll wear shorts and what have you and be very comfortable 
but when i go out somewhere , then unless i have a pair of dress slacks , i do n't usually wear a lot of blue jeans . 
i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how . 
but there are certain norms that companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees . 
and your boss does n't come up to you and say remember , tomorrow you have a meeting 
so you 'd better wear a suit . 
they leave it up to you and your judgment to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have . 
that 's good . 
but , other than that , it 's pretty lax 
and i think that 's good because it does allow people to be individual 
and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day . 
or if you want to be comfortable and casual you can , 
and sometimes i think you may be more productive if you 're comfortable with what you 're wearing and can feel more relaxed . 
and when i 'm writing training material , i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day . 
so , i think , that is good that they 're like that . 
i do know there 's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear 
and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and no variation , 
and i do n't quite agree with that . 
i do n't either . 
and they were doing a presentation 
you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants . 
and one was a skirt 
that can stifle creativity . 
i agree . 
i guess we 've talked probably long enough . 
i guess so , 
it 's been nice talking with you . 
nice talking to you too , 
i enjoyed it . 
on capital punishment in our state , they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman , 
and i believe also in killing someone in the process of rape , 
and i do n't really remember what else . 
what do you think about it . 
i think it 's justified . 
very much so . 
i , agree , , 
i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman . 
i do too , 
i do too . 
i think they 're doing their duty , 
but i think if they 're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it . 
they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman . 
that 's right , 
i agree . 
i agree . 
i heard something on the news the other night 
there 's a little thing at the bottom 
it 's like a call in survey that says do you think so 
and then you call this number 
and you press one for yes and two for no . 
and one of the questions the other day , this last paper was do you think that capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers . which i thought was a real interesting question . 
i did n't , 
he 's just a civilian , 
he 's a black man , 
and he just got fed up with it . 
and he said he 's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything , trying to keep him quiet , 
but he 's organizing people , 
and they 're going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory . 
i think that 's what it 's going to take , though . 
i think so , 
i really do . 
the police , i do n't think can do it alone . 
that 's right , 
i think you 're right . 
it 's going to take all of us getting together , 
i 'm sorry , 
my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed . 
it 's going to take all of us getting together and just saying , we are not going to take it any more . 
we wo n't allow this in our neighborhood . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
and it said they 're going to other neighborhoods from there , 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
the only thing about the death penalty i know that they try to be careful 
and they try to be sure 
but these people are on death row for twenty years . 
i know it . 
i think being convicted is one thing , 
and that 's great if they 're sentenced to death , 
to me you could not sentence them to death unless , the case was for sure . 
by the time it gets there 
and they 've been convicted 
and then they 've been sentenced to death , 
they 're sure . 
there 's no doubt , 
then it should happen , 
there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind , 
there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty . 
that 's right . 
so once , they 've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt , do it , 
i guess that sounds cold , 
that 's right . 
and it 's costing us a heck of a lot of money 
and that 's terrible to look at it that way , 
it is , 
i know 
but that 's the way it is . 
if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death , then do it . 
and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago , 
i do n't know if there was anything in your paper about it . 
i did n't notice it , 
and there was a lot of protest , 
so the governor backed down 
and i was so mad . 
his crime was just horrible . 
and those kind of people you do n't reform them , 
you do n't . 
if they 're the kind of people that commit these grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again , you do n't reform those kind of people . 
and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me . 
and i do n't know , 
i have my doubts . 
that 's right , 
i do too . 
i do n't know , 
i think there 's a point , 
some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do , it just gets out of hand , 
or was it not . 
and she was telling me about it . 
i ca n't remember what the town was , some little area . 
we 've had several here lately 
and that 's maybe what you were talking about . 
is that right . 
that is happened , 
i had n't heard about that . 
i think there 's been six or seven of them , over the last probably eight or nine months . 
they do n't kill them ? 
they do n't kill them , 
and they 're all anywhere from nine to twelve years old is what they 've been . 
and he 's taken them and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard . 
that 's scary , is n't it . 
can you imagine , because it happens in the middle of the night , 
so these parents did n't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming , let me in . 
can you imagine . 
have you seen those ? 
i never even thought about that . 
maybe i 'll take it out . 
i had n't even thought about it . 
that 's terrible . 
it is . 
we were over at a neighbor 's tonight 
and , my little boy is just a little over two 
and their little boy is five , 
so there 's a big difference , 
and they were playing in the back yard 
and we were getting ready to leave 
and the boys were gone 
and the back fence was open . 
. 
and she did n't act like it bothered her at all , 
this happens all the time . 
and we walked through the fence out , 
the alleys , come to the back of the house . 
and i looked down both directions of the alley 
and i saw neither one of them 
and my heart was in my throat , 
and he 's five ? 
i do n't know , 
i know . 
parents around here just let their kids run everywhere , 
and i just ca n't do that . 
and her dad was working in the back yard , and had just left her few minutes in the front yard 
and somebody apparently drove up and took her 
and they never saw her again . 
this is too scary , 
that is just too scary . 
and there 's two gates that go into the back yard 
and we 've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences . 
and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things , 
but it 's on the inside , 
they 'd have to come over the fence , 
they could not open a gate . 
and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there . 
if i do n't hear him playing i get up and come out and look out the window real often , 
and watch , 
i do n't blame you . 
it 's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids 
but you do , 
better safe than sorry . 
and if they find who 's doing that to those little girls , as far as i 'm concerned he could , fry . 
he could fry . 
to put it very bluntly , he could fry , 
because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder . 
, 
and i believe that , 
and this is one of them . 
because these little girls will never be the same . 
that 's terrible . 
never be the same , 
so , i do n't know , 
, it 's really scary 
and i do n't know what needs to be done 
it seems like there 's no room in jails to put them in jail 
i 'm taking a business law class at night 
and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney 
and , so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases 
and he said if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess , whatever you sentence them to , they 're going to serve about a quarter . 
it 's going to be reduced , 
they 'll serve a quarter of it , 
sentence them to a hundred . 
i do n't know , 
it just does n't seem right . 
it does n't , 
it does n't . 
they just get out , 
what are we going to do about it ? 
how can it be changed . unless the legislature will do something 
i do n't know . 
that 's the thing , 
we 're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude , 
and we 're going to have to say , if you commit this crime and if we 're sure you commit this crime , you are going to be sentenced to death period , period , 
and do it . 
and if you commit this crime , you will be in prison for the rest of your life . 
we 're really going to do it . 
and i understand they 're doing it because the prisons are full , 
but somewhere we 've got to come up with some money to build more and keep these people in them . 
i think so . 
i think it would be worth it 
i was watching a show about this the other night 
what do you think ? 
they 're sitting there on number ten , 
they 're saying absolutely no gun control , 
we do n't even want to think about it 
and i think that 's a dumb , situation . 
because there has got to be some kind of background check to see , that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose 
if you 're going to hunt with it , or if you 're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week . 
that 's true . 
if they can check your driver 's license every time you get a ticket 
they should be able to go back and find out if you 've had any kind of psychiatric record , armed felony record . 
that 's true . 
any of that kind of stuff . 
and , it seems to me right now that there 's not that much of a check . 
i think there 's a check for felonies , on your record . 
if the gun shop owner does it , 
but he has to go out and do it . 
that 's true , i think , 
and if it 's a private sale , of course , then there 's nothing . 
and that 's my only problem with making you get the check and everything is , i guess bad guys , if you want to call them bad guys , they are going to get a gun no matter what . 
i do n't think they 're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there 's a check , 
i hope . 
that 's true . 
that 's the kind of people , 
knife , 
he 's going to do what he wants to do . 
that 's true . 
i just think it makes honest people more honest 
and the people who want it , it 's not that big a deal , like i say , to wait . 
and , if you have to have it in a hurry , something 's wrong . 
it makes you wonder , what they need it for all of a sudden here . , 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
i 'm married to a policeman , 
so we talk about this a lot . 
i imagine his opinion is a little bit towards the one there , on the scale of one to ten 
worried about that . 
too many people have too much access . 
they do . 
they do . 
or even the little toy guns look real . 
that 's really gotten bad 
i 've heard so much about that on tv 
and that 's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one . 
if your child is old enough , 
there are a lot of kids who when they 're ten look like they 're twelve , or fourteen and , especially some of the minority children . , 
that 's the truth . 
and if some of them are doing something that they should n't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands 
and a cop comes up , 
you ca n't blame them . 
it looks like they 've got a weapon . 
you ca n't , 
and you ca n't take the chances . 
that 's right , 
because there 's been kids that age who have killed people . 
they 're making them neon colors . 
and i think , that 's a good idea . 
and the kids do n't care . 
that 's right . 
my kid did n't care . 
i know . 
he picks up a stick and goes bang . 
it does n't make any difference to him . 
a gun is a gun to them . 
they can play with anything and make it a gun . 
that 's exactly right . 
i think they ought to do that with toy guns , 
they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them . 
that 's right . 
that 's a good idea . 
and it 's the law that you have a gun , 
every adult is able to carry a gun , 
and they encourage it . 
that 's kind of , 
they encourage it ? 
and , the police love it . which really surprised me 
i think that 's what they were going after , 
they went to interview this town , 
they went to interview them about the gun control laws 
and the police said all the people said , that 's fine 
we could care less . 
we 're all honest , and everything like , that , 
we all carry them , 
but we do n't mind being checked . 
everybody 's got one 
and , so , it was quite unusual to see the people in that town . 
i do n't know . 
that 's kind of an odd thing . 
i do n't know , 
i have a gun 
and my folks have always had . 
i learned to shoot when i was real little . 
i think that 's a lot of it too , is that people need to teach their kids , what to do and what not to do . 
because my dad started letting me shoot a little air b b gun , when i was probably five or six years old . 
but it was , this is how you hold it , 
this is the only place that you do it , which , was out far and away 
and you do n't ever touch it unless i 'm here , 
and you do n't point it at people , 
that 's what we 're doing . 
that 's neat . 
or you ca n't get a deer license . 
that 's real neat . 
and it 's basic stuff , 
and then you crawl over it , and shoot yourself . 
and those things happen . 
that 's real good . 
it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people . 
and they usually are real basic , common sense things . 
put the safety on the gun . 
always assume it 's loaded . 
i know 
and people do n't want to believe that . 
it 's empty , 
it 's empty . 
i took the clip out , or whatever 
and i forgot about the one in the chamber . 
in the chamber . 
that 's exactly right . 
we 're trying to teach our daughter . 
does he got them locked up all the time too ? 
when he 's , 
she 'll know , 
do n't even think about it , 
so , she 's real good about it . 
and , she 's never been curious , 
if he has them out , cleaning them she can be there 
if you make it where it 's not something , curious , 
to be feared 
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about . 
if it 's just one more piece of something , 
but they 've got to understand , like you said , never touch it . 
they 'd have that respect for what it does , and what it can do . 
and it 's up in the closet , 
and then the shells are in another part 
and it 's something to think about , 
and i got it because my husband used to travel , and be out , 
he was out of the country at one time for three months . 
i live in a nice neighborhood , 
but still , 
still . 
sometimes i wonder if i 'm not about to load it because i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there , 
and it 's in a case , 
and it 's put up 
and it 's away and all that , 
but , i do n't want to take the chance 
and , i think , if somebody ever does break in , it 's going to take me a year to find the shells , and then get it , 
he 's got to go to a lot of trouble . 
hold on , 
hold on , 
he 's in here somewhere , 
i know he is . 
i know how to use one . 
we go hunting every once in a while 
and he showed me how to use his guns 
and i really enjoy it 
but if someone did break in , i do n't know that i could or would even grab it . 
i know , 
i used to think about that , 
it was a lot easier when i was single , 
it was one thing 
and when i was just married with no kids , when it was just me , it was an easy decision . 
that 's true . 
it was you come after me , you 're going to get it , 
and now there 's so many other things , 
where are the kids , 
what are they doing , 
where is this person coming in from , 
and , if you manage to get it out then how can you even afford to think about what you 're going to do because you do n't know where your kids are , at the same time . 
we have dogs that are very protective . 
if they 're stupid enough to come through then . 
we have two big dogs in the backyard , and always kind of thought that too , 
kind of an extra buffer . 
they 've got to be pretty stupid , 
any advantage that they can take . 
and , that 's one of them 
unfortunately , 
guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years . 
really does . 
me too , on gun control . 
we 're in pretty good agreement actually on it . 
i think we are . 
it would be even more interesting . 
i 'm glad you 're not . 
me too . 
it 's been nice talking to you . 
you too , 
what kind of lawn and garden work do you do ? . 
so i 've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn , 
and after three years of working at it , i 've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back . 
one time you 'll cut the lawn the long way , 
then you 'll go the opposite way , 
and it helps the grass come back . 
does it really ? 
i did n't know that . 
you 've been working on it for three years ? 
for three years . 
what have you done ? . 
killing lots of fire ants . 
because it was like , you could n't even stand still out there . 
i can barely hear you . 
is this better ? 
a little bit , 
it was like you 'd go out in the yard to water something , 
you 'd just be standing still . 
and the ants would start crawling up your legs . 
it 's like , i 'm not standing in a mound , though . 
how did you get rid of them ? 
it 's a crystal . 
so you have n't had a problem with that , since ? 
not bad . 
every , once in a while you 'll have a mound pop up , 
but that 's , to be expected . 
did it kill anything else it was n't supposed to ? 
not really . 
as far as i can tell it has n't killed anything it was n't supposed to . 
even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it did n't kill it . 
that 's pretty wild . 
we used it for fleas . 
we had fleas in our yard real bad last year , 
and we did that , 
basically , i like to mow the lawn , believe it or not , 
so a lot of times i wo n't get out and do it , 
but my husband , basically , does most of it , 
and he does the edging and all that kind of thing , 
we have winter rye out back , 
i do n't even know what it is out front , 
but this is the first house we 've ever lived in , 
you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard ? 
i found one thing that , it 's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn , 
but , every time i 've done it , it drives the fleas completely out of the area . 
what ? 
i wonder why it does ? 
you do n't have to put a whole lot out , 
and you just go out , and do the entire yard , 
and you do n't have to put clumps of it , 
just very lightly cover the entire yard . 
i 'll have to remember that , because hopefully we wo n't have them this year , 
but we have a cat that comes in and out , 
and the cat was getting fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house , 
so we had a real problem last year with fleas , 
and it was quite a drag because we got them in our house , 
and we got rid of them , believe it or not , with smoke bombs , which is just about impossible to do , 
but we did , 
and so we do n't want them back this year ? 
so i 'll remember that if we see it 's a problem in the yard . 
i do n't know , 
and we 've had to get out and treat our lawn for that . 
but that 's about the extent of our lawn care . 
so , i do n't know , 
do you enjoy doing it ? 
i love it . 
my wife ca n't understand 
it 'd be a hundred degrees outside , 
i 'll be out there . 
but it 's too hot to be working in the yard . 
i 'm under the trees , 
i 'm having fun , 
and i 'm stopping to drink water , 
so what 's the problem ? . 
that 's funny . 
not everybody enjoys it , though . 
everybody has a different thing . 
i kind of enjoy it 
and my husband does n't . 
sometimes i 'm too busy to get out there and do it , 
and he does n't really enjoy doing it , 
but he 'll do it , 
but i 'm kind of like you 
and he 's kind of like your wife . in that he does n't really enjoy it , 
but i would like to have a garden , 
that 's my thing , 
but right now where we 're living we have the trees where their roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground . 
i do n't know what kind of trees they are , 
but you ca n't have a garden , 
you ca n't till it , 
or it 'll tear up a nice tiller . 
so we 're going to wait until we move . 
we do n't have a lot of sun , either , because it 's big trees back there . 
so we 're going to wait , 
and when we move that 's one of our priorities , is to get a house where we can have a garden . 
and so i 'd like to do that . 
i have a feeling i 'll be out there all the time taking care of that , 
but that 's our next thing . 
do you have a garden ? 
this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at . 
sitting on about a two acre lot now , 
and , the back half is my garden . 
that sounds fun . 
where do you all live ? 
southwest where ? 
i guess i assumed you were here . 
that 's neat . 
that 's what we want . 
that 's really what we want , 
but we just have n't been able to do that yet , 
so one day we 'll be able to do it , 
and i 'm excited about it . 
and then i do n't know anything about it , 
i have to learn , 
and then you 'll have to give me a call on gardening . 
what do you do in your garden , 
and i 'll go nothing , 
what should i do ? 
but i guess that 's about it though . 
it sounds like we 've covered all the bases 
so i guess we 'll let you go , 
and do you have anything else you wanted to say ? 
it 's just , i 've had an very enjoyable conversation with you . 
i know , 
you too . 
i hope you have a nice day , 
and we 'll talk to you later . 
you too . 
what have you seen ? 
i knew you were going to say that . 
i want to go see that . 
i just finally ended up going to see it , 
and one day my husband had the kids 
and i just went because we could never get to go see it together because it 's so long . 
so i finally just went to see it . 
and i just thought it was fantastic . 
i was hoping he was going to get best actor . 
but he did pretty good on that one . 
it just blew me away . 
i bet . 
there 're several of them that are out right now that i want to see . 
i 'm afraid to go see that one . 
that one looks so scary just , from the previews . 
i thought i 'd probably have nightmares for the next six months . 
it 's supposed to be good though . 
that 's what people said , 
i know some friends who went to see it . 
they said it was really riveting . 
that 's what they said about the exorcist . 
it 's terrible . 
you 'll have nightmares . 
i watched last weekend . 
me and my roommate . 
we laughed about it . 
i do n't know . 
i saw it when i was a kid 
and i thought , . 
i guess it was because i 'd read the book before i saw the movie . 
and the book , to me , was far more frightening than the movie was . 
he 's a very good writer 
and he had a way of putting you in that scene . 
and , of course , i was living alone at the time 
call the crisis line . 
i bet . 
and there 's rats in the attic . 
let 's see . 
there was a couple of others that are out , 
and i ca n't remember , 
i did n't even like the previews on that . 
i know . 
i ended up at the theater 
and there did n't seem to be anything else on i wanted to see , 
so i 'll try that . 
but it was n't worth anything . 
i did n't care for that at all . 
i did n't think that was any good 
i saw the original back to the future 
i hardly ever go see a sequel . 
i think i 've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one . 
two thousand and ten was far better . 
two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book . 
i had n't read it 
and i could n't figure what was going on half the time , 
nobody could figure it out . 
there 's just things , 
all you can do is put it in words . 
you ca n't put it in pictures . 
a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film , you say what is this ? 
i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago . 
the book is really good . 
and that 's one of them . 
it 's so well written . 
you 're right . 
i have n't . 
that is the most precious movie . 
it has . 
it 's the story of this little cat and dog 
it 's just so realistic . everything they do . 
you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things . 
and it was , a real dog and cat 
a real dog and cat ? 
and all the other animals . 
they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they 're raised . 
and then the cat gets on this treacherous journey . 
he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river 
i do n't know where in the world it is . 
somewhere in china somewhere i think that it was filmed . 
but it 's just really an incredible thing . 
sounds sort of like the incredible journey . 
it was pretty wild 
but there 's nothing else to keep it going . 
but it really keeps me going . 
i 've seen it twice now . 
not anymore . 
all those old good ones that you wish they had on more now , 
that 's something for a kid . 
that 's pretty good . 
i 'll tell you . 
let 's see . 
what are some other ones i 've seen lately . 
i 'm trying to remember . 
i ca n't . 
i just saw one on the video . 
have you seen the gods must be crazy , part two ? 
that is a riot . 
is it ? 
the first one was really good . 
but the second one , is really good too . 
i was really surprised . 
i did n't much care for the first one . 
i thought it was funny . 
but , that 's my sense of humor . 
i 'll have to go get that one i guess . 
it 's hard to find movies that are n't terrible violent or anymore . 
i get so tired of these sequels . 
number nine , number ten , number fourteen . 
. 
. 
i 'm so sick and tired of that . 
i just ca n't believe it . 
it 's like rocky films . 
i have n't seen a one . 
i 've never seen any of those . 
i ca n't either . 
i do n't even rent them . 
you do n't ? 
i figure if i find a movie i like , i 'll buy it . 
cause i just watch them over and over again . 
my husband does that . 
he can watch them over and over . 
there 's very few i would want to see that many times . 
so once he has one he likes to watch it over and over . 
that was a good one . 
i have n't seen that one in a long time . 
i loved that film . , 
it 's just so well done . 
that was the first place i ever saw it . 
it was so good . 
i bet . 
it 's nice . 
so , that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that . 
the whole thing was about the size of a medium house . 
and it was like you could n't stand up inside of it because it was so short . 
the ceilings were so short . 
there 's some nice stuff over there to see . 
i spent four years traveling around and did n't see hardly anything . 
i need , to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel . go around all the places . 
big deal . 
here 's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field . 
it 's boring . 
did you see any movies over there ? 
and that was a riot to see that . 
you know something , 
come to think of it , i do n't think i went to the movies one time . 
and they had a little theater company there 
and we use to go out to that about once a week . 
a really nice place . 
amateurs but really quite good . 
but that was interesting . 
that sounds great . 
but other than that i just did n't have time to go to the movies . 
i rented a lot of videos . 
and who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies . 
probably some of them did . 
a lot of people did . 
but it would have to be a good show . 
it 's hard to know what the good movies are anymore . 
because sometimes the reviews you just ca n't go by . 
they have all these neat phrases like critically acclaimed . 
that 's what they . 
i see . 
it 's kind of like waterfront property or something if you 're two miles away from water . 
from love canal . 
water view . 
waterfront property here at love canal . 
but critically acclaimed . 
give me a break . 
there 's a lot of reasons why i do n't go to movies . 
and primarily i 'm probably going to upset you . 
but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me . 
we 're energized . 
painting , 
interesting . 
the guy called me , 
when the computer called me , i thought that they were reading my mind . 
i 'm in the middle of going out for bids to have my house painted . 
and our house is not 
but it 's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint 's real cheap 
so i 'm looking for the easy way out . 
i know . 
is ? 
it 's easier to find painters , 
are you talking , outside or inside ? 
interior 's not so bad because it 's more fun , 
it can be a real issue . 
so there is n't as much wood that has to be painted . 
the problem is that the sun hits it . 
so preparing is a real problem , 
you 've got to prepare it well 
they do n't put brick on the side of your house just to save money 
and they painted it kind of 
so it 's real cheap . 
. that 's quite a range . 
there 
and i 'm , 
i do n't want it all over the brick and windows 
so you have n't had any jobs painted in your house recently . 
we have done a little painting ourselves , 
we painted the bedroom within the last couple of months , 
that 's fun . 
and we have some more that need to be done , 
but the problem 
and when we bought it it had been vacant for a while because the family retired 
but the daughter was a real estate agent 
and she was selling it 
and it 's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house . 
so she told us that the house had been professionally painted recently . 
and it looked pretty good the interior walls all basically white , 
but they obviously had been done without to much wear afterward . 
big long strips . 
so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly . 
and some still has to be redone . 
either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top 
either that or it had not been prepared underneath 
it comes off in strips not even little bit . 
so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time , 
we know what a job it 's going to be 
because you almost have to strip the whole thing , in order to do it again . 
i wish you good luck . 
thank you very much . 
thank you . 
i 'm all in favor of it , 
i think we 've been doing a pretty good job not taking advantage of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us , 
we could direct the government even more than we have been . 
i do n't think we 've been doing too bad . 
do you think that 's right ? 
do you think , we should direct the government ? . 
just that money is power , 
it 's like his , mother came over 
i just get sorry feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about our intervention and their government and stuff like that , 
and he was all for it because it 's just like you say , 
there 's so many people there that get the kind of control that 's bad , 
and that their governments can become so corrupt 
they , should work their way , 
they should be able to work their self out of it 
or why intervene in another country 's problems and things like that . 
why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that 
but i think just a lot of times if we do n't then that influence will affect our country too for one . 
and for two that it does help . 
i think the people in those country do want our help . the people that are under conditions that are not favorable to their rights . 
but i wish we did n't have to . 
even if a country chooses a government that 's not exactly the kind of government that we have or as in complete opposition to it , at least it 's their choice , as long , 
it is a government that stays in power , that can stay in power , 
but it seems like most of them do n't . 
we fall out of agreements with certain leaders 
or government aids and stuff . 
i think that has a lot of things to , 
i mean , 
i 'm really wondering whether that 's going it settle down or not , 
they were feeding us , 
so i do n't know really what 's going to happen . 
but we 're not intervening in that , 
put it this way , 
i think , 
and we 're allowing , it to happen . 
i agree with that . 
and let 's stand up 
this is ridiculous 
we 're living , with these kind of conditions in a world that 's advancing as fast as it is 
i think people are just saying , we do n't want anywhere of this . 
i guess i do in a way , 
sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that . 
i thought , it was the other way around . 
they are the ones that set a lot of the rules 
and they are the ones that do keep the people down , 
when you , i think that keeps people in sort of line . 
i do n't quite understand that . 
do they even understand what 's being said ? 
which it 's not that way now 
they actually understood , 
they still did n't understand it though , i do n't think , 
not stand up for their rights as much . 
they 're not really sure of what they are . i do n't think . 
i never really thought of , it that way . 
why are they not as vocal 
or why do they not stand up , so to speak , for their rights ? 
i do n't know , 
could be the economic still . 
i do n't , agree with that . 
i do n't agree , 
i think they 've made a lot more chances . 
they 're very vocal . 
so , what 's the difference ? 
racial , i think , 
i think communication does have a lot to do with it in education , maybe . 
i do n't know about education 
because the black community is still not very educated down there . 
so , i think it is communication , 
i think it maybe has a lot to do with education 
that 's true . 
that 's good , in a way . 
something we compete with . 
and i 've been sort of disappointed that they say literacy rate has gone down , 
in our country ? 
in our country , 
good education is really still free . 
that 's just it though , good education . 
is it good education ? 
it may be free 
but is it good education 
and that 's just it 
are we willing to pay for it , 
a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all 
but are they willing to , pay for quality education ? 
and it 's like they 're educating their people to higher degrees than we do . 
so , you 're going to have to expect it . 
are you willing to compromise a little and take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education . 
so , i do n't know . 
how are you ? 
i 'm doing fine . 
where you from ? 
this is quite a long distance . 
it certainly is . 
do you have any pets ? 
use too . 
but none right now . 
how come you do n't have any now ? 
you get tired of them ? 
i live in an apartment building 
and , it 's just not feasible . 
i 'd love to have a dog . 
what is she ? 
and it 's funny how i , acquired this animal . 
and this is what she had told the kids 
and she even told me that . 
after you had an animal for a couple of weeks you become attached to it . 
for sure . 
and she 's been a lot of company . 
she 's however , getting a little old 
and things are starting to fail . 
i live alone now 
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work 
and she 's been holding herself pretty well . up until recently where she 's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is 
and i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home . 
but she 's usually pretty good . 
and it 's made such a difference for her . 
she 's had it for three years now . 
possibly four . 
but it 's really made such a difference for her . 
i 'm a disabled person 
so i 'm unable to , really take care of a pet 
and if that were n't so , i would certainly have one . 
you might want to get yourself an animal that does n't require much attention . like a cat . 
i typically am not a cat person . 
i have a friend that has on occasion brought her cat over for me to keep from time to time . 
and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen . 
and it would sleep on my chest . 
it 's just a great cat , 
my personal preference is a dog . 
i do n't know that i would ever want a cat . 
i like cats . 
i just would n't want to own one . 
they 're affectionate 
you do n't own cats . 
i do n't know , 
i ca n't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog . 
they own you or , grant you with their presence . 
we 're supposed to appreciate them . 
i do n't know that a cat would do that . 
i used to have , a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life . 
i could just walk in the door 
and she knew whether to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over . 
she really could pick up on my mood the way i walked in the door . 
it was uncanny . 
i think in a way we 're able to read each other pretty well because she knows when i 'm upset and i know when she 's not feeling good too . 
i know she 's not doing it on purpose . 
when she was younger , she used to do that to get even with me , 
and some people might not believe that 
but , i do . 
the first thing you do is you get up and you feed this cat something and you make sure that it can get to its litter box . 
for some reason during the night , the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through 
and the next morning when my roommate got up and , did not feed it right away , it decided that it was going to protest . 
have i got your attention now ? 
animals have a way of talking . 
i tell you 
i do n't know that i 'd trade my dog in for the world . 
it was about two years ago she got sick on me 
and i took her to the vet 's because she was n't eating and , she was n't able to jump . 
she lost all her activity 
and she stayed there for one day 
and the doctor called me up and said she had a low white cell count and that she was dying and suggested that i take her to a animal hospital . 
so i took his suggestion 
and i took the dog to the dog hospital there 
and they said they 'd keep her there for three days . 
she ended . 
it cost me over five hundred dollars . 
plus the vet sent me a bill for what he did 
then she recouped . 
she was okay for a couple of years . 
and then she got sick on me again 
and i brought her to a different vet this time 
and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything . 
and he gave me the same medication that i gave her the last time 
and she was okay 
and she 's been okay every since . 
it 's been about two years now . 
that 's great , 
it really is . 
i 'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time . 
the problem is if someone would have came up to me and said it 's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive . what do you want to do ? i probably would have had second thoughts . 
of course , you would . 
you do n't know what it 's going to until it 's all over . 
and the cat got sick . 
so she took the cat to the vet 
and she had the cat there for two days 
and then the cat died . 
so the doctor had called her up and said your cat died 
and you owe me this bill , 
and by the way , do you want me to bury the cat . 
so , it cost her three hundred dollars , 
and she did n't get the cat back . 
so 
they had to pay for all the medical bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses . 
and she just brought the cat in because he was n't feeling good . 
so that was kind of a surprise 
you kind of wonder what really happened . 
they claimed they did the best that they could have 
and then the cat died . 
i 'm looking for another cat for them . 
that will make their day . 
i think it will 
i think they enjoy that . 
only work initially . 
for cats anyway . 
listen 
it 's been a pleasure talking to you . 
the same here . 
and you take care . 
maybe we 'll talk again sometimes . 
what is that sound ? 
that 's my buzzer at the door . 
i 'll let you go . 
thank you . 
i think it 's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference . 
and they really do n't listen to any of the issues anymore . 
because they feel like so many of the politicians are crooked ? 
and so they figure why go out and vote . 
they 're going to do what they want to do . 
they 're corrupt anyway . 
and i think one of the good ways of solving that is everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something . 
that 's the only , thing that i can figure out because i 've heard so many people say i 'm not voting on that one , 
i 'm going to go fishing today . 
or it wo n't make any difference if i do n't vote 
and i think it does . 
we vote every time . 
there 's no question 
it does make a difference . 
because people have to vote in different areas 
and not everyone votes at the same place . 
i , personally , think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools with the idea of the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference . 
and maybe let them have some mock elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young . 
that 's a real good idea . 
and they are doing that in a number of schools . 
however , probably not enough of them country wide . 
but it 's going to take at least a whole generation of people to get across the idea of voting . 
how to say to it and what have you . 
so it 's now to the forefront 
and people are finally taking some action against it . 
and , we 've neglected the value of voting . and what it really means to vote 
and we also do n't make the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them . 
i do n't know how it is up there 
i 'm sure you heard about some of ours . 
it 's like they 're turned off on voting . 
we 're going to have a block party . 
everybody 's going to get together . 
we 're going to discuss the different issues and stuff 
and then we 're going to go and vote . 
we 're going to go vote 
maybe they could give something 
the top neighborhood , if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that . 
it could be a sign that they would put down at the end of your block or anything like that 
but it 's really bad here . 
to me it is . 
it seems like people just do n't care anymore . 
they say , it do n't make any difference . 
one crook is as good as the other one . 
and they do n't bother to listen to what any of them have to say . 
we go vote every time . 
i do n't care how small the ballot is if there 's one thing , if there 's one issue , 
to complain about it , 
and i hear so many people saying i wish this would change , 
i wish that 
but they did n't go vote . 
that 's right . 
and like you said , if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all . and the importance of it because , if you do n't vote for your friend over here your friend 's not going to have a chance . 
that 's right . 
he needs your vote 
just like he needs everybody else 's . 
then they had the voting machines 
but they should start that a lot earlier . 
it 's the same way with everything in education though . 
it should begin right down in the first grade . 
and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning and not wait until they 're in high school 
and then it 's too late to try to change them around at that point . 
but everything should be started on the lower levels 
and certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant 
but you 're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians . 
and perhaps it 's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run that only the most wealthy can do so . 
and they 're not always the best person for the job . 
but they have the money to be able to do it . 
so that there are a lot of problems along that line also . 
a good idea for the young kids like that too , is to have a mock one . 
and this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen 
and this candidate tells you some things . 
then the kids in that class , they are not going to let them vote this time 
but they have to do whatever these people , whichever one the other people elect do . 
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them , now you 're not going to get to vote 
but you 're going to have to do what that person says , 
they would understand probably by the time they were in high school , 
they 'd be ready to vote . 
that 's right . 
and i think that 's an excellent idea . 
they would put them to realize that they 're going to have to do what someone else says even though they did n't vote for it . and that maybe they need to think twice about voting . 
and you do that in the primary . 
they can declare anything they want 
but it 's just a sad situation 
and i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to teach everyone , more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting . so that they 're making some more intelligent decisions . 
i think that sounds great . 
it 's going to take a whole generation of my feeling before that 's going to be accomplished . 
they 'd have to start when they 're real young . 
that 's right . 
it would have to be a child that is just coming into school . 
because i 'll tell you another thing too now . 
the first time i voted , i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines , 
this sounds dumb , 
but i did not know how to use those voting machines 
and nobody ever showed us or anything 
so i did n't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question , all the other kids laughed at them . 
they thought that was funny . 
she do n't even know how , . 
so there was n't any way i was going to go in there and vote . 
and it took such courage you would n't believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because i did n't know how to work the machines . 
it is . 
that 's bad . 
and i was out of school . 
i was a married person . 
and i did n't know how to work the machine . 
and it really scared me , really bad . because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i do n't know how to work this machine . 
where if they 'd had a class or something or , said this is the way , 
just the opportunity to try the voting machines , 
it 's , this is the way it 's going to be . 
and my son was exactly the same way that i was 
and i did n't realize it until his senior year . 
and he said , i did n't go vote . 
he said , there 's no way i 'm getting in that machine . 
then i realized it 
so when we went and voted the next time , i asked the lady , 
i said i want my son to come in with me 
and she said why . 
he 'll have to come back out . 
i said because i want him to know how to use one of these 
and i said , i wo n't turn any of the buttons down 
but i want to show him how to use it so that he 'll be able to vote . 
so he went in 
and now he 's a registered voter . 
good . 
but he would not vote before then . 
and i think that 's bad . 
sure it is . 
here i was . 
and even , of course there 's a lot of years between the two of us , 
do you have any pets ? 
i have three cats and a dog . 
sound like us , 
go ahead . 
we just got the dog less than a year ago 
what kind is it ? 
he 's a mixed breed , 
he 's got a blue tongue ? 
he 's got little spots on them . 
but i was out ruled , 
but i just love them to death . 
was the guinea pig for your child ? 
daughter , 
as if the dogs were n't enough , had to have , a guinea pig , 
so , anyway she enjoys her though , 
so that 's what matters . 
they 're registered 
and we 've been breeding them . 
but i 'm kind of concerned about having cats , and how they socialize with cats . which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed . 
because we thought they would socialize easier , 
and so far he 's bitten ten people . 
and the people that he got the from , used to have cats 
and they no longer have any other cats . 
it 's telling 
we had a cat when we first married , 
we had the cat first , 
and they 'd just play 
and they never harmed her . 
so they got along great , 
i do n't know how it would be bringing in cat to a full grown dog . 
i would n't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog , 
i think they would socialize easier . 
i think , so , too . 
how old is your child ? 
five . 
five ? 
she 's a real . 
so , you had the dogs before you had the baby ? 
i think a lot of that , that we hear all the time is how you bring them up . 
and ours are real friendly , 
they 're protective , 
but they 're very friendly , and lovable , 
what color are they ? 
the female 's red 
and the male is black . 
i bet the black one 's pretty . 
he 's a big old thing . 
and i was concerned about the female mainly , 
about your baby . 
i think that really helped my daughter since she has been playing with them 
and they let her tug their hair and get on their back or whatever 
and she 's grown up with them and loves them to death 
and they love her , 
i think it 's good for kids to grow up around pets , as long as they do n't have any allergies to them or anything . 
i do , too . 
but i think it really helps them to understand when they go to other people 's houses 
and they have pets , 
they . 
that or , the other extreme , 
and i hate that , 
and they should n't be , 
some maybe 
she would n't harm them at all 
and that 's mainly people that have never had pets around their children , 
so , i think it 's a good idea to have them . 
we 've had those , 
and those are neat , 
are they ? 
a lot louder than a dog , 
but they were neat , enjoyable animals to have . 
we 've thought about getting an aquarium , partly for the cats , 
i think the cats would really enjoy it , 
with a lid , . 
of course , , 
and they 're so , expensive to start up . 
they are , 
the saltwater fish have so much more color 
and they 're so , much more beautiful , 
i know they are . 
most of them really are n't that pretty , 
i really do n't care much for them . 
i do n't blame you there , 
i do n't know , 
those fish are just beautiful . 
like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something . 
rather than just little fish . 
and it finally died 
and that was neat , 
she ca n't play with it , 
you can just look at it . 
and then my cats would knock it over . 
i have to be real careful about where i put things , 
if the cats will jump up on things and knock things over all the time , 
they 're always up where they 're not supposed to be . 
and that 's hard . 
that 's just like kids , 
they know that they 're not supposed to do it , 
but they 're going to do it anyway because they know they 're not supposed to . 
that 's right 
and they 're so , independent . 
i love having them for that reason . 
and until we got the dog it was real easy to go to town for three day weekend or whatever , 
and now , it 's like a major production , trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you 're gone . 
that 's right , 
that is hard . 
we knew it , 
but we never even thought that when we got the dog 
we just saw him , 
he 's so , cute , 
let 's take him home . 
and then the first weekend we had him we were in a two bedroom apartment , 
fun . 
and i had to work twelve hours that day , 
and so , i left the dog locked in the bedroom 
and i put paper all over the floor . 
when i came home , i opened the door 
and there were chunks of carpet , padding everything , all over the place 
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door , 
i guess you did n't get your deposit back , did you ? 
i had the carpet fixed , 
i did n't even tell the apartment manager , who got it . 
so , this was , to me , a whole new experience . 
it is . 
only it was n't like cats at all . 
i wish it was . 
i wish they were in that instinct . 
but they do n't . 
and we found , she 's right at a year 
and we finally got her house trained and everything , 
her only problem is trash . 
if you do not pick the trash up the container , and put it on a table or chair or something , she 'll knock it over , 
i do n't care how full she is , 
so , it 's not like she 's hungry , 
it 's just she wants to get into trouble . 
my cats do that if i through anything away that 's any kind of meat or anything , like that , 
anything that they think is good , 
they 'll get into the trash , 
and then it does n't matter where you put it and where you hide it , 
and how tight you have the lid down on it , 
they 'll get into it . 
i 've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor . 
i hate that . 
and the cat 's just looking at me like , sorry . 
you should n't have left it there . 
i could n't help myself . 
i just hate that when she does that , 
and she knows it 's wrong , 
you 'll walk in the door 
and she 'll cower and go hide under the table . 
so , she knows she does wrong . 
but she continues to do it , 
but he 's still chewing . 
is he ? 
who is your favorite football team ? 
guess . 
i bet you ca n't guess . 
you got it . 
and i want to tell you something . 
what 's that ? 
they 're going to go somewhere pretty shortly . 
i think they are because they 're getting better every year . 
i do n't think so . 
we went to the playoffs . 
i like them , too . 
so , it 's good to see the bills doing so well now 
they are . 
they are doing a whole bunch better . 
who 's , their quarterback ? 
what 's that ? 
who 's their quarterback ? 
i like to watch them , too . 
i like to watch almost all the football 
but of course , i watch every saints game that i can watch . 
but i think they 're really going to do good because it seems like they 're finally all coming together . 
now , they 've been able to get some good players and come around 
and then they were n't getting the draft picks 
look at the cowboys . 
they 're hurting . 
really bad . 
but they got so much bad publicity , too . 
and i think that hurt a lot of people even wanting to play on their team . 
does n't give you much respect for their team at all . 
and just because they had a couple of bad seasons . 
and you ca n't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching . 
his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs , because of messing with young children 
and it was just one thing right after the other , with them . 
and had a lot of trouble with injuries , too . 
he 'd never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy . 
you 're right . 
people were jumping ship right and left . 
and , i do n't know , 
that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem , 
but then the team was sold . 
when he bought the team and all it just seemed like he just decided this is the way it 's going to be 
and it was bad . 
it really was . 
to me it was like it 's going to take them quite a while to rebuild 
that 's the way i felt about it . 
but , i tell you what , 
there ai n't nobody going to beat us then . 
because look how good we did without a quarterback this year . 
i know . 
who was the quarterback ? 
they , had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it . , 
and then i ca n't remember that guy 's name , the one that held out for the money 
and he was across the river . 
i ca n't think of his name now , 
but really we did n't have a quarterback . 
that , was the whole problem . 
we had one guy that could n't throw 
and we had one guy that could n't run . 
we really did n't have a quarterback . 
it was defense won all the games . 
were they able to draft anybody this year ? 
i do n't know 
so , i do n't know . 
i had n't heard whether they have a new one or not . 
not yet . 
but i do n't know whether they have one of the first choices of somebody , 
that would be real good . 
everybody gets in draft . 
but , i do n't know whether they 'll be far enough up where they can do any good . 
or even making the playoffs 
so that does n't help you in the draft . 
but really and truly we just do n't have a quarterback , 
that 's all there is to it . 
but , the players and stuff , they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too . 
that was a few years ago . 
he was good . 
but every time we 'd get a real good player they 'd treat him bad . 
and , of course , we had a different coach then , too . 
but they 'd treat him bad 
and then he 'd leave . 
and it was weird . 
if you were good let 's do n't have you on our team . 
but this year they had all good players except for the quarterback . 
i ca n't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks , 
but all of them were bad . 
they were terrible . 
they could not pitch . 
it was , terrible . 
but all the other places our defense was unbelievable . 
it 's one thing , 
did you get to watch any of their games ? 
i 'm pretty sure he was this past season . 
and it seems that they 've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as problems they had in the past 
and now they 're really playing good together as a team . 
when i can . 
i 'm a musician 
this is just something on the side 
i 've lived in so many places . 
teams in your area . 
first of all , first and foremost the bills games i want to see . 
i know it . 
but first and foremost the bills . 
i got to go to a bills game this year , which was fun . 
that 's neat . 
and it was good weather . 
ice and rain and everything . 
but , i tell you what , 
if you get to watch some of these , 
i do n't know how it will be this year , 
but these games go right down to the wire . 
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair going . 
i ca n't remember . 
it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs , or not . 
so , we 're watching the game . 
the other team got the ball 
and we got the ball back . 
that 's the way it was . 
and they had to kick . to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us . 
so we had to sit there , 
and they cut the show off and started showing us another football game . 
we did not get to see the end of the game . 
you talk about people calling in . 
it was wild . 
here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair , 
and then they changed the game . 
and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another one that was going on . 
cut us off right there the last few seconds . 
it was the network . 
because it was funny . 
everybody was furious . 
i was so mad i got up and went and called , 
i could n't believe that . 
but , almost every game that i watched it would come right down to the end , 
we would be ahead , 
but then in the fourth quarter they 'd let them get up there either with them or right ahead of them . 
and it 'd come right down to the end 
and either we made it 
or we did n't . 
and it was something else . 
if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the super bowl . 
there 's no question about it , because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks . 
and the quarterbacks just did n't do anything . 
that 's the guy that counts . 
but , maybe we 'll get your guy . 
all set . 
do you want to start ? 
i can go ahead and start , 
go ahead . 
i know it 's worse in the larger cities . 
it 's kind of a concern for me , 
in fact , at the moment i 'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment 
i am single and female , 
i live on a third floor now , 
but , i 'm real concerned that i do n't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that , 
do they have many buildings that have security there ? 
some buildings do , 
it depends on the location . 
the area i live in right now , is real good as far as crime rate is concerned 
and we do n't have anything at all , 
some places do have guard gates that you have to get through , or electronic access gates and things like that . 
and i 'm a little familiar with the city area , forest lane and through that , off the freeway . 
because to me where we live out here in the north east , there are a lot of buildings very close to each other , 
and they 're going to the big cities . 
it makes it very difficult . 
it really does , 
and i 've seen the same thing that you 're talking about much more crime than ever before . 
and i do n't know , 
a lot of younger people into more violent crimes . 
that 's really sad , 
you got young boys or girls , at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders 
and , no remorse , what so ever . 
it 's really sad . 
it is 
i agree . 
i think that people are getting off too easy . 
they 're just getting put on probation or something , because the prisons do n't have enough room 
so they get lighter sentences , 
and some of those people , they do n't deserve to be let loose . 
in fact on the news last night we were watching this man who lost his ten year old daughter . 
he ran out to the store for a few minutes 
and he had left her home alone . 
ten years old , 
she 's old enough to be alone for a few minutes . 
and while he was gone , he had went looking for a job and stopped at the store , 
that 's what it was . 
and someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets , these two men , went in , raped the girl , murdered her , and the whole bit . 
and the other one was in for life imprisonment . 
and he 's out . 
that 's terrible . 
i should n't say innocent , because i mean , actually if they commit a crime that they 're in the same circumstances 
the reasons that they 're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it it 's two different things . 
sometimes when you lose someone that you really love , you do some crazy things 
i do n't know , 
it 's a little more understandable under the circumstances , i guess . 
especially if they 're found guilty of the crime . 
once they have been arrested 
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt , these people are guilty . 
that 's it , 
we do n't take care of them , 
we do n't support them , 
nothing , 
they go right back where they came from . 
we have enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is . 
so let their country take care of it . 
but they 're , so close , 
and it 's like they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago . 
we 've advanced beyond that , 
you know what i mean . 
it was amazing 
and the guy said let me ask another girl here 
and she thought for a few minutes 
and she said , no . 
and he said is there any place you would n't go by yourself . 
she said , no . 
and they said , it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway 
and somebody will turn it in 
and nothing will be missing . 
they said they can just about guarantee that there , that , that would happen if you did that . 
you better believe it , 
you would n't even have to leave it , 
that 's true , 
it would get snatched right off your arm . 
that 's true . 
i could n't believe that she could n't think of any place . 
that 's amazing , 
what 's the difference there , 
do you know ? 
i 'm not sure what it is there . 
and they really enforce it , 
i believe in the death penalty , 
i really do . 
for drugs they enforce the death penalty for that . 
they 're just , very , very tough , 
they 're just very tough on criminals . 
i think that we 're too easy . 
and we take the , civil liberties stuff too far . 
people that are in prison we did n't put them there . 
they put themselves in that situation . 
we educate them , 
we feed them , 
we take care of them 
and they no sooner get out on the street 
and they 're back in again . 
i 'm not saying they 're all bad , 
but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes , do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives . 
i think that they should be put away . 
get rid of them . 
i think that that 's the whole key here . 
i really think we 're going to far overboard with all of this . 
same with drunk drivers . 
i think it 's too easy for them . 
you have to set an example . 
you have to start somewhere . 
and i think that people know that they 're going to get a slap on the wrist , they might serve a little bit of time and that they 'll be out on the street again . 
and let 's face it , 
what do they get paid . 
not much . 
twenty thousand dollars a year , if they 're lucky . 
i would n't do it for that . 
and especially not in some of these big cities , 
they 're up in the top five of cities that are getting policeman killed in the line of duty 
and that 's really sad . 
it is , 
it really is . 
and they 're the first ones that take the brunt of everything . 
and i 'm not saying that they 're all good either , because there 's good and bad in everything , 
but they have three strikes against them when they 're out there . 
because they 'll arrest someone and go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this , and having all kinds of evidence 
and you have to even be careful how you arrest them , how you talk to them what they say , 
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next ? 
what do we currently have , 
what year ? 
and i 'm ready to get rid of it . 
actually , 
it 's not pretty old . 
and it got wrecked , 
and i 've had a lot of problems with this one , 
you think their quality control 's going down over there , kind of ? 
it 's kind of funny , 
i know a lot , 
it 's true , 
but that 's one reason 
there 's no question 
that 's true . 
and they 're still beating on them , 
that 's true . 
and it 's just amazing 
and they 're not making them like that now , , 
not at all . 
and it was the worst car i 've ever owned , 
it was just a wonderful car 
and then it got wrecked 
and i would n't even look at another car , 
i did n't look around or anything 
i just said that this is what i want , , 
and i really have had a lot of problems with it , 
but i do n't know . 
i 'll probably hold on to it since it 's still under warranty 
but in the first twelve months that i owned it , it was in the shop an average of about once a month , , 
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months . 
that 's a lot . 
it was , 
anyway , 
so , what 's your next purchase supposed to be ? 
i know this , 
if you had a choice of your car , what would you get ? 
this is going to sound really strange , , 
i really like those 
and i have kids , 
i 'm not sure i 'm real familiar with the body style on that . 
i do n't like those styles , 
i do n't know how to explain , 
more of an old fashioned type . 
i 'm not sure how to explain it , 
what 
something like that , 
do you have a family ? 
i have a couple kids . 
that 's probably influenced maybe a little bit . 
but , i know that it 's got to have a radio , it 's got to have air conditioning , , 
it 's got to have those things , 
otherwise , i do n't care . 
when i bought my car , it was right out of college 
and i always been looking for something sporty 
and i ended up getting basically something that i could afford . 
and they 're pretty fun to drive , 
so , i think that 's what i 'm going to have to get next time around , 
i keep holding off 
and then i could upgrade now if i wanted to 
it 's just such a huge expense 
and , i 'm just going to keep holding off 
sports car . 
i 'd like to have a sports car too , 
but it 's not practical for me , 
are you still there ? 
there 's some kind of problems . 
are you still there ? 
something 's wrong . 
wonder what happened . 
i do n't know , 
it sounds funny though , does n't it ? 
it just depends , 
i know that 's what i want , 
but i do n't know if i 'll get myself to spend that kind of money , 
at least , 
i know , 
new cars are n't cheap anyway , 
maybe someday . 
we all have those kind of dreams too , do n't we ? 
you there ? 
this is strange . 
i think , something 's wrong with this . 
i hope it 's recording . 
you there ? 
it may be my phone , 
it 's the only car that says sporty and class , 
you 're right . 
and those are fun . 
those are nice , 
they 're cute cars . 
they 're only going to make three or four thousand . 
so , he went out 
and he traded the other one in and got this one , 
i have n't seen those . 
but i have n't seen one yet either 
but supposedly they have some real wood built in to the clutch and all this and the steering wheel , 
so , it 's very authentic 
and there only is supposed to be limited edition 
no matter what it is , if it 's a limited edition , it 's usually worth something later on . 
anyway hope it 's not going bad , , 
it 's going to bump me out . 
so , i do n't know . 
i would have never figured that , 
i would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that 's limited edition . 
i do n't know , 
i think the demand 's gone all , down a little bit . 
the prices are n't as high , 
and they were n't really that bad though when they were introduced were they ? 
that 's true . 
and they may have gone down a little bit 
they 're still pretty much in demand . 
i think there 's another car coming in , 
and i ca n't remember what i read about that 
i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular , 
it really is . 
that 's the same manufacturer 
those are nice . 
so , they just market them . 
but 
those are supposed to be very performance power 
big time . 
the expensive ones , 
but those are pretty stripped , 
and there 's nothing , 
that one 's just more for looks , 
it does n't have really the performance that the expensive one does . 
but i 've seen one of those , 
it 's not quite as nice for a little bit less . 
they 're not really that bad 
but i do n't know , 
like i said it 's still not practical for me . 
i have a hard time looking at cars like that because i think , there 's no way i can do that . 
i 'm being single 
and no other responsibilities for yourself , 
i 've been pretty happy , 
i , have n't tried to upgrade myself right now , 
i could get something nice and upgrade 
but i 'm consulting right now , 
i just made my first job hop about eight months ago , 
there are quite a few state parks , 
and there 's a couple of national parks that you can camp at . 
most of them have pretty good facilities . 
part of them are . 
so , that 's probably a pretty nice place to go . 
they 've got real nice lake system , around their parks . 
one of them the gray it 's real nice there , 
a bunch of lakes around it , 
what about you , 
and i did n't camp for a long time , 
and then maybe camp another night and drive home . 
and that was pretty good 
and i still do it once in a while . 
i think we 've collected stuff off and on over the years . 
we did it we get about it . 
in terms of north , south i would say it 's , a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it . 
an area . 
they 're about three hours away if you go due north . 
and you can pick those up going west , 
but then you 're talking about six to eight hours . 
the way it works . 
but it 's a real nice place to go and camp , 
they probably just do n't spend as much money as a lot of other states might . 
we 've been down the parkway a lot , 
i think there 's quite a few . 
i ca n't say i 've checked them all out though . 
that seems , like a challenge . 
it 's actually kind of incredible , 
it 's really , really nice . 
i like it better than almost anything i 've ever done . 
just the sky is so amazing . 
you really can probably count thousands of stars , 
and it 's just kind of nice . 
i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which a lot of people do n't realize , 
they hear desert 
course , it has all of those qualities 
but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just do n't find anyway else except in a desert . 
so , it 's pretty nice . 
the movie , the doors , has some nice desert scenes , 
of course , they drag a lot of drugs with them 
but the shots are pretty nice 
and it 's sort of like that , 
it 's just almost surreal , in some places . 
it 's very pleasant . 
are the temperatures real extreme there 
they can be , 
you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what 's going to happen . 
it 's just beautiful . 
but it 's quite bearable 
it 's just great . 
it 's really very nice . 
i do n't know when i 'm going to get a chance to do that 
that would be pretty nice . 
that 's okay . 
a lot of people like to go down and camp down inside , 
i was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking , especially with my gear . 
i 'll bet . 
that one thing you said about the stars is really true 
so it 's nice to get away . 
it 's just amazing , how much you miss . 
it , 
it , 
otherwise it 's just too faint . 
i guess we 've talked as much as we need to on the subject . 
i think we fulfilled our obligation . 
thanks for calling , 
nice talking to you . 
what baseball team are you familiar with ? 
come on , 
after that , if you asked me that i would n't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball . 
i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later 
i heard a joke on the radio yesterday in regard that he did n't design the patriot missile system , 
and the radio 's kind of cruel , 
how humiliating for a man to do that , any man . 
i do n't care if you 're president . 
but at the same time , i do n't know , 
it 's pretty far to throw that far . 
i could n't do it . 
i know 
but he 's a man 
come on , 
men know how to do that ? 
he 's supposed to be able to do that . 
i know 
so , i felt kind of sorry for him . 
that must have been hard on him because he 's just a person 
a major owner of the team here . 
i did n't know that . 
i thought he was the owner 
but it turns out my mom said that he 's part owner 
but he must own the biggest chunk 
i even know his name because he 's on the news a lot , 
and i never had to watch the news not like some people hour and a half a day or anything . 
my husband 's french 
it 's incentive , 
i saw that . 
did you see that , where the guy asked him for proof of who he was , 
i know 
and see a credit card . 
i know 
and he said 
it does so fast , 
i heard it on the radio . 
i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car 
but i did n't see it 
it was so funny to see , 
it was a really cute little kid too . 
that 's about my extent about baseball , 
i do n't know , that much about it . 
because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game , 
and i could n't tell you who pitched , 
but they won , 
did they ? 
not my a lot , 
and then somebody else lost , 
that 's so stupid that you all have two teams . 
that 's really stupid . 
then they can have them play against each other . 
i know . 
i thought they were moving to new jersey . 
this is how much i know about baseball . 
we did go to a baseball game last year . 
he makes good money too doing that , 
i was shocked , 
he did n't want them , 
so they gave them to us , 
with baseball tickets . 
and we ended up with them . 
and so we were , walking up 
. 
and i looked at my husband 
i bet these are really good seats 
and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor , 
they called us at five 
and the game started at seven 
so we just threw everything together , ran over and got the tickets and walked 
and so we took two kids with us 
because they 're fancy seats and stuff . 
and you just sit down 
and all the girls were all dressed up , 
i just was there , 
like i 'm loaded , 
i 'm here , 
but we got to sit by first base 
if they did hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in . 
i know i 'm always scared of that whenever i go to a game . 
i rarely go 
but we went last year 
he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff , 
and if there 's a game on , he 's watching it . 
that 's all there is to it , 
i 'm glad my husband 's not like that . 
i 'm glad my husband 's not like that either , 
i 'd kill him . 
my brother 's like that 
and he goes to a lot of games , 
not a real lot , 
but he tries to go , 
then my father got us some tickets , 
so my brother 's wife and my husband and i went . 
and he describes it as , you sit there in a crowd , 
it was nice weather and stuff , 
it was n't a real problem , 
but you sit there in a crowd , 
and you 're waiting and waiting and waiting 
and you eat the hot dogs , 
because we made him try a hot dog , 
that 's funny . 
so you sit there 
and you wait for the longest time really bored , 
and then all of a sudden something happens 
but you happen to look the other way during the time , 
you miss the whole thing . 
and so basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen 
and when it happened he missed it , and did n't understand it 
that 's funny . 
he grew up in , which is the , sort of strip east to west , eastern part , 
he 's not that far , 
and she 's lived there off and on for twenty years . 
is she still there ? 
and it sits right at the limit , 
that 's neat . 
she married 
and they have twelve children . 
twelve children ? 
she has twelve children . 
the poor woman . 
she looks gorgeous , 
she 's gorgeous 
and she just liked having kids 
and she 's thin 
and four or more children are thin , 
you probably ca n't afford to eat if you have more than two of them . 
i have a friend now that has seven . 
and they 're all nine and under , 
they 're all real young , 
they 're just raised right 
but they 're not condemning you , 
we only have one child , 
they do n't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy for them to do that , 
you get a conviction like that 
and you think everyone should have it . 
and so i 'm real proud of them because they do n't do that at all . 
you go in their bathroom 
and there 's ten tooth brushes in there . 
and i always give her a hard time 
but how do they afford to even have the kids , 
we 're expecting our first baby , almost any day 
they live lean for one thing 
it puts a whole in your money bag , 
i think that helps a lot . 
i think that 's the key , in his sales last year 
he just works a normal job . 
it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done , 
and he got to do it 
and we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that , 
but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things 
but it 's a different kind 
and a lot times people think , i 'm not blessed 
i have an old car . 
but you 've got five kids , 
a lot of wisdom in it . 
and the kids at bible talk about anything but training , 
and training is different than anything else 
psychology does n't address it . 
the good stuff that 's in psychology it just comes out of the bible 
but the things that work in psychology other the years that they 've proven to work , they just come out of the bible 
and so this book it just really 
how to train them so they 're going to be a blessing 
and so they do that 
and they just live lean pretty much 
it 's pretty nice 
and everything 's pretty expensive 
and you just ca n't do that 
and you do n't go to baseball games as much 
or you get pictures like we did . 
you know what i mean ? 
you do these fun things in other kinds of ways 
but it 's kind of a different situation because you 're probably living in an apartment ? 
that makes a really big difference . 
but , still it 's just as hard as having , that , 
but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids . 
they 're not all boys 
and right now we do n't have a girls ' league because i 'm the one that 's supposed to start one 
and i just have n't gotten around to doing it . 
i keep saying we need to have one . 
they go , then start one . 
but everybody wants to do it 
and i just had n't gotten around to doing it , 
so they could really only have four members on the team . 
i think they only have four boys . 
i do n't even think they have but two old enough to play yet . 
but then you did n't believe me about her kids 
they are so good . 
but she does work with them 
and it 's a commitment 
and , that 's what they 're called to do . 
i really can . 
i know , 
i do too , 
most of my friends have three or four kids 
and some of the people in our church use birth control 
i had my tubes tied 
all kinds mostly between the ages of two and ten . 
a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer 
and they became like my children . 
i 'd think so . 
and they live in an apartment complex 
and we played on the playground a lot 
and there was always an activity , , 
and i do n't know 
it just seems like there was always something to do . 
children are so full of energy . 
and they just keep you going . 
was this a one parent or two parent family ? 
one parent . 
one parent . 
how much time did she spend with them ? 
not much at all . 
the children usually were n't awake by then . 
and she would get home at five thirty in the afternoon . 
and they would have dinner 
and then it was time for them to go to bed . 
now at this particular time the children were two and six . 
he 's nine now 
and i 've watched him grow up 
and he 's like a little brother to me . 
and it 's changed over the years , 
we get along a lot better now that he 's older . 
and we do different things now , 
we used to play ball a lot 
and he 's into wrestling . 
we went to go see a movie and things like that 
but i feel like when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them . 
you say you go to school ? 
and what are you studying ? 
communications . 
i love children . 
i do n't know , 
when i was growing up my mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high . 
i think it was very beneficial to us . 
in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books 
and she was just always there for us , 
but nowadays if there are two parents to a family , the mother works just as hard as the father does , 
and the children either stay at home and get into trouble 
or they 're stuck in a day care . 
and i just do n't want my children to have to be raised like that . 
all my friends , their parents worked all the time , 
they got to stay at home by themselves 
and when i was younger i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things , like i could n't ride my bike across the street , but they could because their mom would never know it . 
but now i realize that it was better because they have got into a lot of trouble , because of lack of supervision . 
you say you 're in communications , 
what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to ? 
i 'm majoring in public relations . 
public relations , 
so , you would have a job with a company ? rather than radio or television or newspapers or , what have you . 
and then you 'd be willing to give up your job to stay home or stay with the children ? 
i would like to stay at home with my children for at least the first five years . 
but what i plan to do in the future is go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters , and work on my doctorate and teach college , 
and in that case then i 'll be at home when my children are at home , 
and then i would be at my school , teaching . 
that is an advantage of being in the education field . 
what grade ? 
i started out with college and then went to high school 
did you ? 
what did you teach ? 
i taught physical education . 
i sure did . 
and it worked out fine from that standpoint , 
and then our son , he had to get on the bus , 
and he did get on the bus , 
it was his responsibility 
absolutely . 
i was in physical education then 
and i just kept getting pushed into administration , 
wound up in administration , 
and so , he thought surely that i would have bought a hot line , to know if he ever skipped school , which , of course , was not the case 
and i would n't have checked on him . 
however there are , points both directions in that from the standpoint of parents working and not working . 
i listened to more than one parent say i do n't know what this child wants . 
i 'm working two jobs , 
they each have their own television , 
they each have their own telephone , 
they each have their own rooms , 
they each have this , 
they each have that . 
i 'd say , but what they do n't have is you . 
that 's right . 
they need some attention . 
absolutely . 
because that is the way of getting attention . 
whenever my mom stayed home with us , we did without a lot , 
it 's hard to make it on one income , 
that 's right . 
but we did 
and we only had one car , 
we only had one telephone , 
we did n't get to eat out all the time 
but i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar , 
and i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up , 
and i hope that i can provide that for my child too . 
and we need more of that , 
we need more parents willing to supervise , 
though we 've had such a breakdown in the family structure , from the standpoint of , church and school and everything along the way . 
we have . 
and that has contributed much to the delinquency that works and the poor school results that we 're having . that the students ' parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning 
and i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one , two , and three . to get the students off to a good start let them have positive experiences , from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and keep going and not wait until they 're in the ninth and tenth grades , 
it 's too late then , 
you can not , reverse that trend at that point . 
it is . 
it 's way too late , 
i agree . 
and while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child 's in the elementary school they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point . 
and , that is just as valuable , at that time , as to the rush in the elementary . 
it is . because all the peer pressure , it starts in high school 
and the parent really needs to be there for the child . 
and the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something . 
we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football 
and i did keep statistics for his team , 
and , his dad did take movies of the football team and movies of the basketball team , 
and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time . 
so , i feel that i learned a great deal from my students with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents . 
when i was your age i did n't have this or that , 
i guess that was good that you were hearing it from other students . 
and i had to deal with their problems 
and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect 
and our son would share this 
and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of , lines . so that , i think he benefited from my experiences . 
he works for a different company . 
and we did n't even know it . 
he did n't even tell us . that he had three jobs 
but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account 
and we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go , 
if he got married he was on his own , 
on a scale of one to ten being ten , no , kind of legislation and zero being total ban , i probably would lean more towards six or seven . 
i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands . 
and they have a total ban on guns 
and i saw that , it did n't stop crime in that state . 
or was that on rifles ? 
and also i think there was a fine . 
and that did n't help at all ? 
the crime is not any better or any worse , 
i should n't say i do n't know if it was any worse , 
but it certainly did n't get any better . 
i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the , three , where i do n't think you should necessarily ban guns by any means , 
but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature , 
you should n't be able to go out there and just buy one right off the shelf . 
i agree with that . 
i think that the law on who can buy a gun are way too lax . 
and , so , i think that kind of control would be good , 
i 'm trying to think of how many times you make the statement and , just to kind of it a little bit 
only the guns were in the hands of the criminals , 
i guess i have never heard of a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who 's being robbed had a gun . 
and maybe they just do n't report those 
or i 'm not sure 
but good thing they had their gun on them 
and they thwarted the robbery attempt . 
i 'm not really sure , 
personally i do n't own a gun , 
and i do n't think i probably ever would although i would like to know how to handle one , 
and i think everybody should learn how to handle one . 
you just never know when you might come into contact with one . 
how about that . 
so we ended up with these guns , 
and really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right 
and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb 
and so that was really the only experience that i 've had with guns 
and it kind of scared me . 
but i think that if i learn how to use one , i would feel better . 
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately , 
of course in this world anytime you 've freedom you can be able to get anything you want . 
that 's true . 
i do n't know if that 's a large percentage of crime or not 
but i guess it would be some . 
and i think that that 's a good idea . 
i would definitely support that . 
and i know this may sound kind of stereo typical 
but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks . that 's kind of scary to me 
that 's crazy . 
i do n't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles . 
especially not in the back window , for everybody to see . 
that 's kind of wild . 
that is kind of wild . 
that 's all very interesting . 
thanks for talking . 
you 're welcome . 
so do you have a personal computer ? 
we do have one in our home , 
but it has been used tremendously , mostly by my children for playing games . 
but it does have a word processing program , which all of us have used for reports and papers and that sort of thing . 
when this subject was mentioned to us i went , that 's all i use mine for is a word processor , 
and i have n't used it since i got out of college , 
and that was six years ago , 
my sister bought it 
and my father had a small business 
and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business , 
and he never did , 
he always did everything out by hand . 
he only had three employees , 
so it was n't really worth it to him to do it . 
it would be worth it , if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand . 
like pay , the payroll 
and there are , lots of them on the market . 
basically payroll . 
but you do have to research that , find out what works for your system . 
what kind do you have ? 
i think it 's a professional three hundred , 
that 's the digital one . 
that 's a nice computer . 
she moved 
and my father was n't using it , 
so she took it with her . 
do n't blame her . 
so i do n't know if she 's going to even use it anymore . 
encourage her to try other things , 
i work in a school system , 
and i teach writing 
and we use the computers a great deal for word processing because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer , as you probably found out yourself , 
but i also am sponsoring a literary magazine , 
and we 're doing our entire layout on the computer because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have , a publishing program . 
that 's neat , 
that 's , a very good use . 
so , it is wonderful , 
once you get into some of the programs that are out now , you can do so much with them , that you do n't do until you really make yourself use them . 
i know there 's got to be a lot of uses , 
but it 's just you have , to have a need . 
you have to make yourself do it , 
but you have to have a need . 
i really have no need for it at all , 
i work for digital equipment 
and we have a powerful computer down at work . 
so , you do n't need a personal one ? 
and i still really do n't do that much , as you say , play games on it , 
they 're great for playing games . 
my son is studying electronic technology , 
and he 's been able to do things on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his reports , and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way . 
if you 're doing that sort of thing it 's really useful , 
but unless it is , i guess it 's kind of a waste . 
that 's , fascinating . 
the c a d . 
i knew what you meant , 
and that 's really neat , 
but this is one step above it , 
but it 's actual drafting , 
you can do wonderful design . 
you have to be so precise . 
and the computer does it all for you . 
so it was really neat . 
i wanted to go to that course , 
but my boss would n't pay for it , 
i 'm i 'll get a job some day 
and my boss will pay for it , 
i 'll be needed . 
because i did n't want to go do it myself 
because i did n't think i was really going to use it . 
i got this cough , 
it was bad . 
what a change ? 
it was a big change . 
you could n't really wear a coat because it was so hot , 
and then , again , i picked up a cold . 
but i 'm doing all right , getting over it . 
that 's good . 
so i do n't even know how much personal computers cost nowadays . 
they vary tremendously . 
the ones that were made a few years ago have come down in price significantly , 
i 've seen them for five , and six hundred dollars , 
you ca n't do very much on them . 
it 's just that you have to be able to get your program in , 
and , many of the programs are so big , 
they take up so much space that you do n't have any place then to work . 
but if you want to go into one that 's really useful , you 're going to have to go over a thousand dollars , 
and even for a personal computer it 's probably smart to spend that much , 
ours is not quite that powerful , 
some things we ca n't do , 
but then we have n't needed to either , 
but we 've been able to do what we can . 
i have n't even begun to reach the limits , 
junior , 
and it 's not quite as useful , not quite as powerful . 
they did , 
that 's very true , 
that 's very true , 
they did . 
very competitive . 
i do n't even know my sister spent on hers , 
but i just thought it 's going to be a waste , 
she 's , not going to use it . 
sounds that you were right . 
she likes it , 
she gets to write her reports , 
but like i say , she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted . 
and she could have bought a typewriter also . 
a typewriter with memory would have been fine , 
it 's all she uses it for . 
i think it might have a spelling editor on it , 
i 'm not sure . 
if it does n't she could easily put it on . 
that 's the one great thing about it . 
which program did you use ? 
did you use word perfect ? 
it was six years ago . 
she pretty much set it up . 
she goes , you make your file , 
and then you can edit it . 
i used the one at work a lot , 
write a couple of resumes , 
and i was just great , 
and all you have to do is just put it in the spelling check mode , 
and i do n't even have to look my words up anymore . 
they 're great , 
you 're right . 
i guess we 've spent our time . 
i need to go help my daughter do something , 
so this has been fun talking to you . 
good . 
good luck . 
i guess i do n't really have a problem with capital punishment . 
i know that they have capital punishment for certain crimes , 
and that 's probably the way i feel about it is , it kind of depends on the crime that 's committed . 
seems to be a lot of controversy about that . 
i tend to agree with you , 
probably pretty similar views on it , 
but that 's one of the things i do n't understand is so much of the controversy 
because i do also , myself , believe in capital punishment , 
that 's true . i guess , 
there 's probably two or three different types of views as far as the controversy goes . 
that 's kind of the way i feel . 
he 's not going to get any better , 
it 's just not going to get any better . 
a lot of people have the opinion that , do n't have capital punishment , 
but give them life in jail 
i think that 's what aggravates a lot of people , is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty , 
but the problem is not so much with the prison system , 
they 're trying to cope with them , 
the thing about capital punishment , 
a lot of people do n't think it would be a deterrent to future crime , 
and the way it is now , it 's not . 
and that 's certainly no kind of deterrent , 
and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it 's not a deterrent , because it 's not . 
it 's not . 
you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after committing a crime are really pretty slim right now . 
and you can , probably spend a lot of time or maybe eventually just waiting it out , 
they may spend years , 
and the last i heard it was costing ten , twenty , thirty thousand dollars a year to keep these guys waiting . 
it 's amazing . 
there 's a girl i work with , our secretary , as a matter of fact , 
and the guy , that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death he 's been on death row for eight years . 
but still , for some reason this guy 's sentence has not been carried out , 
he 's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people , 
and the state still ca n't bring itself to execute , this guy . 
to carry it out . 
it sort of takes the justice out of the justice system . 
it does , 
it really does . 
she , and they have to go back , 
and just ever so often she mentions , she 's got to do something else write another letter , or do something . 
it should be over and done with . 
she should be getting on with her life getting that part behind her , 
but yet , it 's kind of tied to her the way it is now . 
it is . 
a victim , 
not only indirectly of the crime , but also indirectly by that , indirect involvement . 
it 's ridiculous . 
she 's an emotional victim . 
it 's terrible 
i could n't be a cop for that very reason because they do . 
the criminal gets right back out 
and the cop 's just got to go back and do his thing all over again , because so many of the crimes are done by repeat offenders . 
they are . 
that 's about five minutes , 
it 's a pleasure talking with you . 
we 'll see you later . 
what , 
go ahead and tell me about your home . 
my home at the moment is an apartment . 
is that right ? . 
that 's interesting . 
and let 's see , 
we are to compare homes . 
correct ? 
my home is typical for the area . 
i live in a development , 
it sounds like i 'm bragging . 
that 's okay . 
but it 's upper middle class kind of an environment . 
it 's a two story colonial , which my wife and i designed . 
that 's neat . 
that 's large . 
and i would imagine in terms of size and so forth , it 's relatively typical for the area . 
i would say it 's probably midsized for the area . 
there are some smaller , 
and there are , several larger . 
it is probably ten years old . 
that 's not too bad , 
that 's still fairly new . 
the housing there is extremely affordable compared to other parts of the country , 
do you mind if i ask what it 's worth down there , 
so , i have n't really priced in the market , 
although right now it 's a lot lower because of all the layoffs and everything 
the economy around here is real poor . 
i thought that was on the upswing again now . 
not really . 
there 's been tremendous amounts of , layoffs 
so , really housing is real bad . 
the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad , 
but housing is still real bad . 
it really is a buyer 's market there now . 
there has been a lot of speculative building . 
i do n't know , 
a new carrier was coming in and the attendant support vessels . 
that 's no longer , the case . 
it is . 
the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population . 
and so overbuilding has been a real problem there . 
so you can still get a good house for a very , very reasonable price . 
let 's say typical , say three bedroom two and a half baths , on a half acre or so of land , 
and probably , perhaps , cheaper , depending upon the neighborhood . 
what about your home ? 
but it is a home . 
it 's a four bedroom home . 
it 's on one floor . 
we have no basement . 
i do n't know , 
nor do we , 
i was n't sure . 
most of the ones up north and everything do , 
but anyway it 's also pretty typical for the area . 
most of this area was developed , 
it 's almost twenty years old , 
and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style . 
we have a friend that lives two blocks over , 
but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same . 
so i think most of them are 
like most areas that are built there were probably two or three styles you could choose from . 
and , that 's pretty much all the houses in the area , for probably a square mile at least , maybe even a little bit more than that . 
we are west . 
they designed it and everything , 
and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand . 
that 's not unusual , 
for example there is a condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live , 
and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium . 
it was very nicely done . 
sounds like a lot of money though , 
i ca n't envision spending that much money , on something along those lines . 
maybe a little bit higher than that now , 
but that same house here , you 'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year , taxes on it . 
that much of a difference ? 
it 's really sad . 
this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country . 
why is that ? 
do you know ? 
they do have such things as extremely good school systems , for example . 
it has one of the best school systems in the country . 
public employees make great salaries around here . 
this is the figure , 
they did not define it , 
what kind of a car do you drive now ? 
do you ? 
i bought mine a year ago 
so i 'm not buying a car any time soon . 
me either . 
i just bought mine , 
it will be a year in august . 
i love it though . 
i think i found my car . 
i like where all the controls are 
they 're in good spots 
and i have an automatic 
i ca n't drive a standard . 
i have a standard . 
an it 's supposedly real reliable 
i had n't heard that . 
what did you have before you bought that . 
did you ? 
and that was the worse car i 've ever driven in my life . 
it was nine years old 
and it , was still going strong . 
and that was the only major problem that i had 
and i had replaced the tires 
but it was a standard also 
and the clutch went out on it toward the end , 
i had it five years 
and the last two years it seemed to go out really easily . 
i think it went out twice in two years 
and that 's a lot 
it should n't go out that much . 
but i do n't think i 'm going to do that again . 
i think i 'm going back to automatic now . 
i kind of know how to drive standard 
but i 've never owned one 
so i do n't drive one a lot . 
i do n't feel comfortable in traffic with it . 
and for everything i 've heard it 's a lot easier to sell an automatic . 
it is . 
and resale value is really important to me . 
that 's true . 
it is too 
not at all . 
but , it still looked real nice , 
the interior was still really nice , 
there was n't cracks all over the dash board and stuff . 
and it had some nice features . 
of course , i may never sell it , 
i may drive it until it 's dead 
i like foreign cars a lot . 
i was looking for a four door car having driven the r x seven so long , 
and it was so small 
and it 's really impractical . 
so , i wanted something with a real trunk , and four doors something easy to get in and out of 
and those were really nice 
and i can get them for a great price . 
but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through . 
i was n't even looking for a car when i bought this car . 
and she was going to sell her car because she did n't need it anymore 
and it was only a year old 
and i had never driven a prelude . 
so , i went to a dealership because they had the same year and same model , of prelude on their used car lot 
and i went 
and i test drove it 
they 're nice i think . 
and i , bought it loaded . 
i have to have them loaded , 
i love all those little things that you do n't need 
but they 're so wonderful . 
i went there looking at a used car 
and two days later i bought this car . 
i felt like that was largest impulse that i had ever made . 
i understand . 
i go for the big stuff . 
i noticed . 
mine was definitely not impulse 
i really needed a new car . 
it was getting worn out from being a sports car . 
i drove it kind of hard , 
and i got it right after high school . 
so , by the time i traded it in it was ready . 
ready to go . 
did you ? 
but i guess this was n't really an impulse 
, buying it right then and right quickly was kind of impulsive 
but i 'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years 
and i was just scared to . 
that 's the same with me . 
would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself ? 
buy a used car ? 
i was going to buy one once 
but i worry about who 's driven them and what they 've been through and the warranties and things like that . 
just , i ca n't seem to get over that . 
i do n't know why . 
and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars 
and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff . 
that 's true . 
they ca n't stop you from doing it . 
that 's true . 
i guess that 's all . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
i guess we 're on . 
hang on 
do you usually get a message ? 
hang on 
let me check on it . 
i do n't know . 
let me try it once more . 
i think we 're on , maybe . 
i guess we 'll find out . 
i really was n't from here 
and besides i like the city . 
but i do n't know 
is that where you are now ? 
and unfortunately , of course , the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years . 
i do n't know , 
they 're still behind them 
but it 's not like it used to be . 
you back the winners 
and you do n't back them when they 're not doing well . 
that 's right . 
they always went out and tried to draft the best athletes . and did n't really draft for any particular spot . 
but they would go out and try to go for the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche . 
and then about four or five years ago , they started going after specific players or positions , 
and they 'd go after them saying what you really need is a defensive end . 
so they 'd go out and try to find a defensive end 
and when they drafted somebody and he did n't work out at that spot it really was n't a good enough athlete to move to any place else . 
so i think it was kind ever interesting . 
i think the decline of the cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started with not drafting the best athletes . 
it makes sense because you 've got the flexibility 
if they 're good athlete they can do a bunch of different things . 
my main sport is baseball 
but i 've been enjoying football 
but i do n't know it as well . 
cowboys are going to have a problem are n't they ? 
or what was the whole deal on that ? 
they still have some draft picks that they got , 
they do n't , have anything high do they ? 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
it went the other way . 
what was i thinking . 
my brain is really working well tonight . 
that 's okay , 
i 've got a friend that lives right next to the cowboys ' training camp . 
and he sees them out running a lot 
and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys 
and they 're all thinking that they really got something going this year , 
but i guess when you have a whole bunch of professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody 's got great hopes . 
i guess it 's the same way with baseball or anybody , 
spring training until you actually start going out and getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good . 
because , i know in baseball any manager you go to say , we 're going to be in the world series , even though there 's not a prayer . 
this is the way it is . 
they finished pretty close to five hundred last year did n't they ? 
they did . as a matter of fact , 
because they only won one game the year before ? 
i enjoyed that because it was against the skins . 
you do n't like the skins ? 
and i really do n't like d c a whole lot at all . 
they got a big thing because of the expansion going on in baseball . 
d c is talking about how they 're going to get a baseball team and everything . 
it 's you guys are n't going to get a baseball team , 
i 'm sorry 
it 's not going to happen . 
but anyway i 've never liked d c a whole lot 
of course , 
the first thing is the phone call from the league saying he was coach of the year 
can you believe that . 
i used to travel out that way a lot 
they 've built a new stadium downtown , 
it 's opening next year . 
i forgot the name of it . 
the inner harbor . 
it 's a couple of blocks west . 
there is an old railroad yard , basically , 
and then there 's an old station 
and they 're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the inner harbor , which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the inner harbor 
but they 're building the baseball stadium 
you know ? 
sitting here and talking about all the cities that i hate , 
and i was not real happy when they left to go there of all places . 
that 's true . 
i take it you 're an east coast type guy ? plus the west , coast , 
kind of all over the place but , east coast lately , 
what do you think about it ? 
most of the stuff up until now , in the recent months , i do n't have any problem with . 
i do n't either . 
i do n't think it 's going to change very much 
i agree with that . as far as the mess that 's developing as a result , 
in fact , it really was to begin with . 
and i heard a comment on the radio this morning that it gets to a point where if enough people are going to be slaughtered over there over the internal problems somebody may step in again . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
you ca n't please them one way or the other . 
and i think that , i agree with you , 
this is exactly the right course . 
it has nothing to do with us . 
that 's right . 
these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time . 
all the time . 
and it 's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years . 
and it 's going to continue . 
that 's right . 
as long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power , it 's going to happen all the time . 
that 's absolutely right . 
and this is just another time that it 's happening . 
that 's absolutely right . 
they 'll regroup out in the mountains 
and they 'll try it again in a couple of years . 
it 's a very opportune moment for them to try . 
and i do n't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it . 
but , i 'm not real sure that we promised them anything . 
that would have been stupid , 
and i do n't think we did it . 
everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right . 
i do n't think they would have done that . 
i agree . 
but it really does n't make any difference . 
this is just another chapter in middle eastern history . 
and there are many of them . 
there 's no doubt about it . 
the french occupied it , 
we 've done it . 
it 's happened so many times , 
this is really nothing special . 
and so many of the conflicts really do n't have a basis in , politics or human rights or anything like that . 
it 's religious based 
that 's right , 
it 's mostly religious anyway . 
and it is right . 
and then we go on from there 
it 's a mess . 
there 's no doubt about it , 
that 's right . 
their politics really is n't politics . 
it 's religion couched as politics . 
and there 's a big difference . 
we sit there 
and we think that they think the way we think . 
and that 's a big mistake , because they do n't . 
you bet . 
you bet . 
because there 's a complete different set of values . 
there 's different value placed on human life possessions and everything else . 
and what 's right is wrong 
and what 's wrong is right in some cases . 
that 's it a lot of the time . 
i was stationed in turkey for a year and a half . 
and it was tough , understanding those folks . 
it was very strange . 
i believe it . 
it was very interesting . 
i can believe that . 
i do n't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means , 
i think some of these people that they claim as middle eastern experts do n't have a clue sometimes . 
that 's probably true , 
that 's probably true . 
they sit there and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert . 
i 'm not real sure that 's appropriate . 
a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field . 
and we make experts by reading books . 
that 's right . 
that 's right , 
that 's an everyday occurrence . 
it 's like our car industry , 
i agree . 
it 's an overall problem in this country understanding foreign cultures , or even accepting them . 
but it 's going to get even worse later . 
looks who 's getting the engineering degrees and , the math and the science and everything . 
that 's right . 
it 's not us . 
that 's right . 
we 've got folks running around here who get degrees in basket weaving and underwater psychology , or some ridiculous stuff like that . 
and where are the engineers coming from ? 
they 're coming from various places , 
and a lot of them are going back there . 
it 's not industrial engineering , 
it 's human factors . 
his degree was in industrial engineering . 
i see . 
and the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it . 
but i see it all too often . 
we 've got loads of foreign students 
and they 're coming here , going after the hard degrees 
and they 're applying it there . 
that 's right . 
and i do n't know , 
to me it 's amazing . 
i do n't know what we 're going to do as a country . 
we 're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later . 
the country 's got a problem with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that . 
and the long-range views are just kind of , become a thing of the past . 
i do n't think there can be anymore long range planning . 
here 's a crisis . 
let 's plug it up . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know what the answer is . 
it 's far beyond me . 
that 's for sure . 
that 's the way things have gotten . 
all we can do is keep plugging . 
i wonder , 
at a price tag of six thousand bucks , i do n't know if they 're going to have a whole lot of takers . 
but i 'm sorry i got it . 
it 's slow , 
the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school 
but up to that point i had always said i would never have one because i would n't pay that kind of money for their name . 
that 's right . 
that 's absolutely right , 
you watch , 
it 's already outdated . 
it 's obsolete , 
and we fight that battle every day here at work , 
i can imagine . 
and things just kept changing so much 
and i kept getting rid of them , 
and i finally said , you ca n't do this . 
that 's right . 
you 've got to buy something and stick with it , 
that 's right . 
at an opportune time i got one that suited my needs 
and i 've just stuck with it . 
the only thing i 've done to it is just add a mouse and a hard drive . 
and that 's all i plan to do . 
of course , i 'm limited on memory now because i 've got the low line . 
but i 'm not a power user 
so it does n't matter . 
that 's the key , 
whatever works for you . 
and if it does the job , then that 's what you need . 
he 's looking now to get rid of his . 
what do you think about the peace corps or public service commitment ? 
that 's the first i 've ever heard of it . 
i have n't heard anything too much about it . 
i think it was thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft 
and people said , young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country , 
but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from some sort of public service , like the conservation corps back in the thirties or various other things of that sort . 
and it seems to me that it 's not a totally bad idea , 
but i do n't quite see how they 'd make it work . 
my first impression was it would be very good . 
i think it would be good for people to serve , 
but i do n't know if it should be an option . 
it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids . 
and i think there are some available now where they are able to work , 
and some people would get military service 
and some people would get civilian service , like working in hospitals . 
they were allowed to do hospital service or things like that , 
or farm work in world war one i remember reading about . 
and i suppose that there is justification for taking everybody if you take anybody . 
it 's a possibility . 
i 'd much rather work in a hospital than to go war 
and i 'm sure most young men and women would . 
it was something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life . 
that makes sense . 
and then you run into the bureaucracy in running it . 
how you going to cover that many people 
because we 've got a lot more people now than we did then 
and , in addition to that , we have the cost because you have to pay something for , their room and board 
even if it 's like the peace corps where they do n't get most of it until they come home , you have to pay them something . 
plus the training involved . 
that would be expensive in most cases . 
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization , 
but on the other hand , i 'm not sure what the permanent value of it was . 
i do n't , know what we got for all the money . 
but i do n't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went , in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better . 
and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me . 
but i do n't know if i was doing it in different situation not a really religious background , if i would get a lot out of it . 
i think i did because it emphasized that sort of thing . 
a lot of self evaluation . 
and it was definitely voluntary , too . 
they were not drafting you and sending you , against your will . 
and i 'm sure that would make a big difference , too . 
what about a voluntary program ? 
do you think that would be a good idea ? 
like i say , i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for teenagers to go and do work in the national parks and work in neighborhoods to clean up and that sort of thing . 
but i do n't know what organization it 's under . 
i do n't know if it 's a government run or if it 's a private charity that 's put it together . 
i do n't either . 
the ones that are not dangerous 
and they , do forestry work . 
they maintain trails 
and they put up signs 
and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort . 
and that i know is run by the state , 
but there may be other things . 
i 'm not so sure what kind of training that is for the future for those kids . 
how much benefit , it 'll do them in the long run ? 
it 's probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble , 
but whether it 's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject . 
especially if you take a child that 's from the inner city and then put them in a middle of a park , 
if they go back to the inner city , they may not see trees for a while , much less be able to take care of them . 
that 's true . 
good point , 
so that may not benefit them in the long run . 
i 'm sorry , 
i 'm going to have to go , 
but my other line is blinking . 
thank you . 
but it was good to talk to you . 
you , too , 
it 's very easy for anybody to find out about you . 
i do n't really like that very much . 
what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff ? 
it was just as a demonstration to show those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person . 
mostly it dealt with marketing companies , these direct marketing , associations . 
that was the primary subject . 
and they 're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer . 
that 's not really good . 
i do n't know , 
i guess that 's an invasion of privacy . 
i 'm not sure that that 's an everyday thing , though , at least not for an individual . 
something that i feel is pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that 's really so common that it 's accepted as the norm now , is the open office concept . 
the open office ? 
that 's all fine and good , 
but you do n't really have any privacy at all . 
i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen . 
and it 's not just that , 
it 's the whole thing about if you 're trying to concentrate it 's rather hard , 
sometimes it 's almost impossible to do because your space is not your own space . 
and i work in a situation like that 
and i really kind of have a problem with that . 
do you work with mixed company , male and female 
is there anybody who does n't ? 
there are a few out there . 
i suppose it depends on who you 're working for and where at . 
but my own environment is open totally . 
there 's nothing to block anything . 
so 
but i guess we 're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody 's record , 
or the computers , the big advent of that because they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button 
and it appears in front of them , 
i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families . 
that 's no secret , 
and it should n't be that way . 
i do n't think that 's quite right either . 
it 's not really government for the people and by the people , 
i 'll tell you that . 
what do you think could be done about it ? 
it 's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that 's serving in the office . 
the only thing that can be changed is for everybody to say , we 've had enough of you , 
out you go . 
but i do n't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that . 
it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done . 
i do n't know , 
it 's still a free country insofar as we 're able to obtain information . 
and i would n't be for total banning of all information 
or , it 's mostly the private information that we 're all concerned about . 
but it 's hard to define a lot of those boundaries . 
it really is . 
something that i 've just had a dealing with is a credit bureau . 
they take my name , which is a very common name , 
and my last name is even more common 
and they check that name against their list 
and they find several . 
and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all , they just report everything under that name . 
they do n't even check my social security number . 
and companies are paying them good money to report accurately , 
and they 're not , 
they 're so lazy . 
they 're just not doing it . 
they just find your name 
and they match it up . 
then to get it removed they say you have to write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them , 
and then it takes three weeks and all . 
and i 'm baloney . 
you fix it . 
is that usually what you tell them in the letter ? 
what i 've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report 
and i do n't . 
and i said i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you 're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you 're providing to them . 
so then they can call the credit bureau and say , we 're paying you good money to report this properly 
and you 're not doing your job . 
good idea . 
so that 's what i 've taken to doing lately , 
and it seems to work pretty well so far . 
that 's good . 
any other problems ? 
not that i can think of . 
i can probably go on , 
i probably better let you get back to work . 
it 's nice talking to you . 
maybe again . 
there we go . 
how way back 
what 's that ? 
is that right ? 
so he 's still kicking around . 
that 's interesting . 
i saw them , 
i was out there last summer , 
is that the stadium ? 
i could n't tell you for sure . 
it 's been a long time . 
so there used to be a race track . 
that was impression i got when i was there 
i think that 's right . 
so had a lot of fun 
actually i like minor league baseball , a lot . 
it 's cheaper for one thing . 
that 's true . 
but they 've never been able to do more than one of those in any given year . 
i think they 're in for a odd year this year , 
i do n't either . 
he ca n't field 
and he strikes out a lot , 
but he 's done that for five years . 
why get rid of him now ? 
he 's not the liability that he was , that he used to be . 
if he strikes out a lot , so what . 
but that does n't mean get three other guys who hit , 
all they can do is hit home runs and strike out which they did . 
i think the pitching 's deep enough that it does n't matter . 
it may be . 
i like them a lot . 
i think they 're going to go all the way . 
and , by saying i like them , i like their chances . 
i 'm a giants fan from way back . 
but butler did n't hurt either . 
who 's the last one . 
he 's a pretty decent pitcher . 
he is . 
and that guy the short stop , is going to be good . 
it should be an interesting year . 
i 've already been to one game , 
and i should have been to two 
mostly die , 
and i do enjoy them . 
three hundred miles . 
keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes . 
it 's incredible . 
there you go . 
and saw the cardinals and cubs last year , and a bunch of teams the year before . 
you are a baseball fan , are n't you . 
i try to see whatever i can . 
hope i 'm going to do it this year because having a kid this fall , 
so it 's so much for going to lots of baseball games . 
so do it while you can . 
seriously . 
it 's been good talking with you . 
good talking with you . 
i would n't mind it . 
i 'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right . 
and good talking with you . 
and good talking with you . 
take care . 
do you have any children ? 
i do n't . 
you do n't . 
do you ? 
i have one . 
a five year old daughter . 
did you ever have her in child care ? 
i do . 
i stayed off work with her for little over of a year when she was born . 
and then i had her at a private sitter for two , two and a half years after that . 
and how did you choose that sitter ? 
she was referred to me by a couple of people 
and she turned out to be wonderful . 
i could n't have asked for anything better , i do n't think . 
i did n't want to send her straight to a day care . 
and , even though she was that old , i still did n't want her to go to a day care . 
and this lady , you would think it was her own . 
she 's real good . 
it 's hard to find people like that . 
it is . 
and she 's really , really doing good and learning a lot . 
and , actually , i 've started working up there in the afternoons , too . 
that 's neat . 
i guess . 
i 'm going to quit as soon as the school season 's over . 
but i really enjoyed being with her up there . 
i hate it for her , 
she has to stay that much longer , 
do they have classes for them during the summer , too ? 
they go year-round teach them . 
now , in the summer they have a lot of field trips . 
there 's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one , and stuff like that . 
it 's a lot more lax . 
but they still go through all their curriculum as usual . 
what kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there ? 
my husband and i both went . 
we kind of give her the third degree . 
i 'm glad to hear that . 
we went over to her house , 
we just told here we 'd be over that day . 
we did n't tell her when . 
so , that way i did n't think the house would be cleaned or anything for me specifically . 
and she had a daughter , 
and i want to say her daughter was six or seven , right around first , second grade . 
and at the time she kept one other child about a four year old . 
but it was only a part-time basis . 
so , we went over there 
and we questioned her about what she fed them and what she did with them during the day and just how she treated them , how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and , stuff like that . 
and we really seem to be pleased with her . 
did you introduce your daughter to her before you made , your decision ? 
and she still loves her to death . 
when they see each other they just love each other to death . 
and she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter . either making her clothes or , buying her things . 
so , we 're real , real lucky . 
so she stayed with her about , roughly two years , 
and she had to go back to work , 
they had some other expenses that came up 
so she had to go get a real job . 
get a real job , full time . 
i checked a lot of places out the kinder cares and the , stuff like that . 
and it had been recommended by some friends of ours 
but it 's an older place . 
and so , i checked out all the new places that were near us 
and then i checked that place out 
and they did n't just play all day long , 
i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went and or interviewed at , they did a lot of play work and stuff . 
and i thought , that must be pretty good if everybody 's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into , their school . 
and they made sure they pointed it out . 
one place i think i did n't take her . 
and , i just kind of let her go , see what she felt like doing . 
if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them . 
so , i felt more comfortable at , that place . 
that 's , the true test . 
and she was real comfortable . 
and she has really , really done good . 
it 's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her . 
but , she seems to me to be pretty quick and smart 
and she 's already reading and writing and stuff , like that . 
that 's good . 
and she just turned five last month . 
that , is good then . 
i think so . 
i did n't want to rush school at her the whole time , 
but , . . 
i wanted , to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next five months , because i know she 's going to have to face that . 
and . here we go . 
that 's right . 
i just hate that , 
but . 
so , you do n't have any children . 
i have a nephew . 
he 's a little brat . 
my sister 's not real bright , 
but he 's always sick . 
he has always got some kind of , cold or something . 
and , i do n't know , 
i do n't think this place is a very good place for him . 
it 's just kind of convenient 
and she 's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else . 
that 's a shame . 
i do n't think she checks things out very well . which , really surprises me . 
that 's , scary . 
it is scary . 
i was petrified . 
i know . 
i would be , too . 
i do n't know , 
that 's just it . 
and that 's why i do n't mind paying more . 
i do n't know . 
and that 's one reason i like working up there a little bit is , because i know what 's really going on . 
that 's right . 
i think that 's an ideal situation . 
because at her school as soon as you drive up it 's got a circular type drive . 
they sit 
and they have car callers 
and some kid goes out and gets the kid 
and , it 's time to go . 
at first that always kind of bothered me . 
not bothered me , 
but i thought , i 'd like to see what she 's doing . 
and it 's hard to get them out , 
and a lot of parents have places to go and things like that . 
that 's right . 
and it 's late at night , 
so now it does n't bother me at all 
i 'm not sure what the street is , 
is it near country club , 
that one that 's , set back in the woods ? 
i 've seen the signs 
that 's it . 
but i 've never actually seen the place itself . 
it 's pretty , set far back , off the road . 
and that 's something i like , too , 
that little kinder care , whatever it is ? 
this is on a highway , too . 
there 's a difference . 
i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out , 
or , if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could go , in and get one . 
that 's right . 
or a car accident . 
and , that was one of the places i had checked out . 
and it was brand new when i checked it out 
and , of course , it was beautiful and , clean and smelled wonderful in there , 
but i 
i did n't base everything on that . 
because that all wears off . 
that 's right . 
that 's exactly right . 
you get some kids in there 
and it 's , over quick . 
but i 've been real pleased , 
knock on wood . 
i 'm scared to death . 
i do n't know , 
i do know why 
because drugs and , everything else 
i would be , too . 
and , they talk about how soon they start that 
and that scares me . 
i know . 
it is scary . 
do they teach them in school right now where she 's at about drugs ? 
they 've had police officers come in and talk to them about it . 
but , of course , they still have no concept of , what in the world drugs are 
and what to do when they 're faced with it . 
but i just think of her , 
is n't that , sixth grade , 
and that 's a big gap . 
it is . 
and i can honestly see the peer pressure there . 
i can , see it , too . 
those kids getting snatched 
and i 'm probably a little too over protective 
but nowadays you have to be . 
nothing wrong with that . 
you do . 
i do n't think there 's anything wrong with that . 
i was going , how can you be so protective ? 
but , it 's easy now . 
now you understand . 
that 's what i 'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say , when you have kids of your own , you 'll understand . 
that 's exactly right 
and i do . 
but . 
are you married ? 
are y'all planning on having kids ? 
we 'd like to . 
that 's good . 
because they 're really neat . 
what 's your most recent one that you 've seen ? 
i have n't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months , 
so i have n't really seen any movies in the movie theater 
but i rent probably four or five movies a week . 
i used to do that too , 
but i have n't been doing it lately 
we 've got a good video place out here 
and i 'm just trying to think of all the movies i 've recently seen . 
i have n't seen that one , 
is it good ? 
it depends , 
i know that sounds funny coming from a woman , 
but usually i do n't . 
what type of movies do you like ? 
action . 
i guess two of my favorite movies is probably lethal weapon and lethal weapon two . 
and those are two of my most favorite , 
they 're just really good movies . 
and i liked bird on a wire . and movies like that . 
do you like suspense movies 
or do you like just action 
what do you mean 
are you talking about movies like die hard two . 
or fatal attraction . 
i liked that , 
that was pretty good . 
that was okay , 
i guess i thought it was too far fetched 
but so many people said it was n't . 
i hope i do n't run across them . 
i do n't know , 
i just did n't find that one to be real , 
i just thought it was too far fetched . 
what was your favorite all time movie ? 
i ca n't think off my head . 
i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most that i was really the most in shock with was probably star wars . 
when that first came out , i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that . 
out of all the movies , i 've never been as excited to go back . 
i was ready to go back and see it again 
you 're right about that , 
but that 's really an all time classic . 
i do n't think anything could ever beat that . 
i 've never seen that . 
you have n't ? 
should i rent it ? 
should i go rent it tomorrow . 
that 's a real interesting movie 
and it 's got a good historical perspective to it . 
that 's probably something i need to see right now because i 'm taking history in school . 
so it 'd probably be a good thing for me to see . 
primarily one of his brothers , 
and i wo n't give the whole plot away 
but it 's really a good movie . 
and one of them was lost for many , many years 
and he turns out to be a law man . 
it 's really interesting 
you just gave it away , 
i guess i ca n't go see it , 
that 's okay , 
i did n't give away the whole thing , 
i just gave away just enough to get you interested . 
that does sound good , 
i guess it 's a rental . 
it is . 
i may have to do that . go see it , 
or go rent it . 
what 's his first name . 
i ca n't remember his first name . 
i do n't know , 
i do n't watch that . 
i ca n't even remember the name . 
he said he would n't really talk about it . 
did n't want to talk about him because he did n't think he was such a good action guy . 
i ca n't remember . 
i ca n't remember the guy 's name . 
that 's one side of the action that i did n't really care for 
i do n't think he 's really a very good actor . 
i know that sounds awful because so many people think he 's so wonderful 
that 's pretty good . 
i do n't know , 
i just have never seen any interest in him , 
we actually rent probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films . 
do n't watch really very many horror films at all . 
i do n't either . 
i do n't know , 
you 're right . 
and so , when i watch movies like that , it 's this can not happen . 
so , i just do n't enjoy it because it 's just come on , give me a break . 
and so many of them are done so poorly , 
it just does n't even give you the effect , 
some of them are done good 
and they do scare you . 
i do n't know , 
i 'm not really into those . 
that was one of my favorites , 
i thought that was a very good movie . 
i was really impressed with that one . 
what i liked about it was that it was a new subject . 
nobody had ever touched it before . 
and it was done so well , 
students might try to do it . 
and it 's not like there 's a lot of scientific data on it . 
that 's probably true . 
but it was a very good movie . 
it was done real well too . 
there was n't any part of it that you really felt this ca n't happen . 
it seemed real , 
it was really good . 
it 's not my all time favorite movie 
but it was good , 
it was really good . 
and i do n't know if you like this kind , 
but i thought pretty woman was a really good movie , too . 
that was a great movie . 
we 've seen that two or three times . 
we waited 
and we rented it , 
but it was really good . 
i have n't , 
i do n't know if i 've even heard of that one . 
it must have what 's his name in it . 
it does n't , 
i 'm surprised . 
that must be pretty good then , 
was it good . 
it is , 
it 's kind of a poor man 's pretty woman in reverse . 
but it was kind of cute . 
i though that was a really cute movie , 
i enjoyed that . 
it was . 
there was another one , 
i have n't . 
you 've got to see that one , 
that 's probably true , 
that 's probably true . 
it 's very , very good . 
very good . 
i was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it . 
and he signed it . 
and he signed it . 
he happens to be a friend of one of her business associates . or , not a friend , a cousin . 
that 's impressive . 
but we got a nice picture 
so we 've got to try to get out there and see that one . 
it 's really worth it . 
it 's a very good movie 
and i would suggest seeing it at the theater . 
i know that they 're still playing it 
and they pushed it back , to playing it in the theaters until august , 
and then when it won all those awards they pushed it back to august , 
but 
that one is definitely worth seeing , 
it 's really good . 
and i did n't think that one was near as good . 
i guess it was okay , 
it was all right , 
i do n't know . 
and yet , for whatever reason his crime was not considered a capital crime . 
and quite honestly i feel very strongly that the , man has no redeeming social values 
i do n't know , 
i do n't think our prison system is n't set up , where we rehabilitate , or restore anybody . 
i think it 'll only make them worse , 
and i do believe that capital punishment is , uh , alternative . 
but you still have to pay your visa bill . 
that 's right . 
you still have to , 
and those prison people they know a genuine turnaround in a person 's character , 
they see that . 
did you ? 
i have a degree in social work . 
you see it the ones that have a genuine character change . 
it is obvious . 
and they know that . 
they 're not going to pardon someone from the governor , 
you know what i 'm saying , 
they 're not going to go , without going through every channel of authority in the prison . 
so i feel like there is occasions where they do spare lives 
punishment . 
thank you , 
i 'm sorry , 
i just got home from work 
that 's okay . 
i agree with you that , a person 's heart can be changed , 
right then it was , almost immediate . 
we do n't have a speedy trial , 
we do n't have speedy punishment 
and so it kind of loses its meaning , if you sit on death row for months and years and so forth . 
we do n't , 
but the base is still there , 
the foundation is still there , though , of the system , 
but , i know what you 're saying , 
but also , they 're under a law , because we have n't been removed from the law 
we 've just been taken out from under a law . 
because under the law if your child back talks you , he would be stoned . 
that 's correct . 
under the law he would be stoned , 
so we 've been removed from being under the law 
but we 're still accountable to it . 
we do n't need to back talk , 
but in the new , he 's looking at your heart 
and so , i guess that 's what i mean by their character changes 
and what i mean , it 's like looking beyond what they 're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart , what 's the character showing me here . 
i believe crimes against children should be punished by death sexual crimes , unless there 's a true change of character . 
i tend to agree on that , very strongly . 
and that 's where we just have to trust the authorities . 
and they 're not going to excuse people , if it was run like that , 
there would probably be very few exceptions to that 
and if it was done quickly and done swiftly 
, because the judicial system they 've rejected the answer to all these problems they have , pretty much . 
and having sat on both uh , criminal and a civil jury , some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time . 
because we 're suit happy . 
but back to the capital situation , sounds like you and i have a lot of , common ground at least as far as capital punishment is concerned . 
i would like to see some kind of reform , or some kind of streamlining so that , if a person is convicted , and sentenced to death , that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with . 
and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way , because it does n't do the criminal or the victim 's family , any of us , the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years . 
anybody , 
him could be a her . 
i know that they have crimes punishable by death , 
and i 'm sure they hit a few every now and then , 
and i would n't want to be one of them , that are not guilty . 
but , i know that they have their , crime rate , 
i ca n't remember which , 
my husband 's going . 
and they do n't have a lot of the crime because there is a law 
and the law is enforced . 
the law 's not being enforced 
and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack 
we were across from that big bus station , 
i forget what you call it , 
and , you 'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days . 
that 's sad . 
because , the answer is not being given to them , in the court system 
and it was really an integral part , 
and 
you ca n't force people , 
but i think people are hurting 
and they 're out doing crack sitting on the street . 
they were the kind of people that mostly , we would want to receive it . if it was presented to see . 
i do n't know , 
you know what i mean . 
i know , 
you 're right , 
they would lobby that 
and i see that , 
and that 's why i 'm what 's my role in this thing , what 's my part , 
because i do n't think the system is going to get fixed . 
i think it 's crippled ... 
but it is something that i 've done in the past . 
how about you ? 
we try to go once , maybe twice a summer . just for a short weekend or something . 
that 's pretty average to me . 
we do n't go for the week long thing . 
do you tent camp 
a tent . 
that 's how i camp too . 
me too . 
the rest of that is really not the same . 
as a little girl i 'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother , 
so , that 's really wild . 
where are you ? 
so we have a five year old , 
the kids love it . 
i know . 
they just love it . 
it 's wonderful for them to be outside . 
i know , 
and they do n't have all these modern toys , 
and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like , that to play with . 
and i like that . 
it 's pretty fun . 
it really is a good family thing , to do . 
we try to go with another couple that have children also . 
and that makes it a lot more enjoyable . 
plus we do n't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff , 
we kind of split it up . 
good planning . 
even the sleeping bags , those are running a good thirty dollars a pop , 
and so we 've built that up . 
you 're right . 
do you have a boat ? 
want one bad . 
do you ? 
actually , you know what i would love ? 
but that 's what i would like , to have . 
i would too . 
would too . 
let 's see , 
we try to go to a lake . 
and , so we 'll go to a lake where they can go do that . 
we 're close enough so they can do that , 
and the girls can play on the beach area . 
and i would play on the beach area too . 
that 's what i would do . 
that 's fun . 
i 'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that . 
but you know what 's really funny ? 
and there is just no way i 've not picked one up . 
you do n't sound like it to me . 
i 've only lived here about six years . 
have you ? 
so , if i have one , it must be very , very slight . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
i do n't think i do , 
i have more of a twang , to my voice . 
i sure am . 
i 've lived here all my life . 
good for you . 
we went last summer , actually . 
this , 
i 'm wondering , 
i 'm really not familiar . 
is there ? 
that would be fun though to go . 
that 's one thing my husband wanted to do , on this summer 's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went . 
and i said , i 'd love that 
it takes a lot more planning . 
it does , 
so , we 're hoping to do a three day weekend . 
i do n't know if you have ever heard of it ? 
i have n't . 
i think it 's around two hours from here . 
and it has dinosaur tracks , and stuff like that 
that sounds great . 
and it 's got one of those wildlife parks . 
i think that 'll be fun . 
so we 're going to try to do that on a three day weekend , go there 
i have n't . 
where at ? 
it is beautiful . 
is it ? 
absolutely beautiful . 
i 've just been up there skiing , 
but i would love to camp , in the mountains . 
that 's what my girlfriend says . 
she loves that place . 
you need to go there . 
she loves that . 
and there 's this little mountain lakes 
and it 's very peaceful . 
i ca n't remember what type of trees they are , 
but all the leaves turn yellow , 
and it 's just brilliant . 
i love that . 
you would . 
you 'd like it very much . 
that 's neat . 
that 's neat . 
i know you would . 
i was too . 
all the time . 
i got real used to it then . 
i felt like we roughed it then . 
we did , 
we really did . 
that is it . 
you say you have n't been in years ? 
i have n't . 
i 'm a struggling single mom . 
thank you . 
time is precious , 
money 's precious . 
i think i have n't been able to do it , 
and that was one of the things i really thought i 'd like to do with my children again . 
and i 'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women . 
i do n't blame you . 
you know ? 
i do n't blame you at all . 
years ago it would have been fine 
i have gone on one little vacation , just the girls and i . 
and that was great . 
and , i stayed in a nice place . 
but it 's real different not to have another adult with you . 
you know . 
i can imagine . 
i 'm just a chicken . 
i know lots of women would do it all the time . 
i do n't blame you , not nowadays . 
i have n't quite adjusted ? 
so it was a good plan 
but i have n't yet . 
have you ? . 
i got into sales , 
and , i 'm selling telephone systems . 
that 's neat . 
and it 's fun 
and it 's interesting , 
but it 's also pretty challenging , 
and i have n't started making money yet . 
. it 's hard is n't it ? 
so 
it 's hard . 
how old are your girls ? 
so i 'm old . 
you 're not old . 
you 're not old at all . 
excuse me just second . 
go ahead . 
there 's someone at the door . 
do you need to go ? 
i 'm going to listen . 
we always check and see if we should answer the door , at night . 
that 's very smart . 
so i 've enjoyed this . 
me too . 
and good luck . 
how many have you made so far , calls ? 
i have n't made any . 
have you ? 
this is only about my second one i 've ever made . 
how many have you had so far , 
do you know ? 
i think i 've had about four . 
four , 
that 's good . 
very good . 
that 's four each . 
it 's like what are you interested in , 
and it 's virtually anything . 
i 'll talk about anything to anybody . 
i do n't , 
you bet , 
you bet . 
and it 's been real interesting , the different personalities . that i run across . 
i know . 
i always try to find out where they 're from , 
because it is neat . 
it really is . 
then , i guess i 'll let you go so you can go get the door 
thank you . 
and i enjoyed talking with you . 
me too . 
when you go next time , think of me . 
thank you . 
go ahead . 
by the time you get off work , go by and pick up the baby from the baby sitter , it 's after six 
i guess that 's the way i am too . 
sometimes i hear some things on the radio . 
i only get the newspaper on the weekends 
i do n't even have , time to read the newspaper except in passing , 
i 'll look over my husband 's shoulder and see what 's going on . 
i guess occasionally i 'll hear someone at work say something though . 
we have a news thing on the computer that i 'll try to look at every day . 
and it 's pretty much headline news . 
which is n't pretty much what we look for anyway . 
what do you think about it ? 
i guess it 's pretty good . 
there 's a lot of competition in the media . 
and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who 's going to get the best headlines . and that they 'll run a topic into the ground . 
and they try to play public 's opinion . which i think is awful , because it usually works . 
i 'll bet that was the case of the war in the middle east . 
that , 
so , it will be interesting to see what happens . 
trying to think what else . is current . 
i do n't know what to say . 
that 's a bad one , 
i hate to see that , 
we can deduct that from our federal income tax . 
but we need good schools . 
we 're more involved in that now . 
and , i think it 's better for everybody if we had better schools . 
that 's true . 
i would think they could find a better way to fund it though , 
i wish they could have gotten a lottery . 
they 're struggling with it . 
i think the lottery could have helped , with that . 
it would n't have been as painful as what we would 've paid in state income tax . 
probably would have paid the same amount 
but it 's not the idea of your paying income tax . 
i 'm not sure there 's a positive solution for that . 
it 'll be interesting to see what happens . 
trying to think what else is current . 
i have n't seen the news in a couple of days . 
i 'm a little behind on things . 
that 's sad . 
they had to choose between the better of the two bad situations , 
and i do n't know what i would have done in the situation . 
it begins to make you wonder why we did n't go ahead and go on in and , finish the job while we were in there . 
and he 'd have all these people jumping down his back , even though i 'd agree with it . 
i think he should 've gone in there and blew them away . 
seems to have helped him though , popularity wise . 
it did a lot . 
he did a real good job i believe . 
and they stayed active . 
it was a new situation . 
i 'll bet . 
i do n't really have much more to say . 
i do n't know anything else that 's current other than the weather 
you 're right , 
we got some awful rain the other morning . 
we did last night . 
apparently , i do n't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too . 
caused some damage . 
it did ? 
we may get some more tonight . 
. we 've just got slight chances of rain . 
the ground here is so flat , 
and it 's all saturated now , 
we 're getting some flooding . 
last week , we had all the rain ? 
i think we had about eight inches . 
it was between six and eight inches here where we are . 
and you walk out on the ground , 
it 's awful . 
it 's just so soggy . 
it 's a lot more humid down that way . 
in fact , miserable . 
i guess that 's it . 
that 's about as much as we can do with current events . 
it was nice talking to you . 
the public school systems everybody has known they 've needed renovation for years , but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it . 
the first direction that i would love to see them go with . 
kids learn at different rates 
and for too long they 've kind of lumped everybody together . 
you 'd learn at this rate 
and that 's the only way it 's going to happen . 
that 's true . 
you 've got some kids that 'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you 're talking about it , 
that 's very true . 
one picks up real quick 
and the other one does n't . 
and you 're right , 
they do get bored really fast , if they already know what you 're talking about . 
what do you propose that they do ? 
what is your suggestions ? 
out of each child . 
out of each child . 
each individual child . 
some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff . 
other kids are going to be really into math , 
some are really going to be heavy into reading . 
instead of pushing the scales too far either direction it 's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff . 
but why not hit the points the kid 's really interested in ? 
because if he 's interested , he 's going to study it , 
and he 's going to learn it , 
and he 's going to remember it . 
that 's true . 
i think the only thing that they would argue about that , is that every child needs to learn every subject . 
that might be the only thing . 
but i definitely agree with you . 
they need exposure to every subject . 
they do n't need to be masters of it , 
that 's true . 
i definitely agree . 
there 's no doubt about that . 
i can relate to that because i 'm going to college right now , 
i 'm taking this history class . 
and it 's so boring , 
and i just hate it . 
and i think , why do they make us take this stuff ? 
what does this have to do with getting a computer science degree or whatever ? 
what type of history class is it that you 're having to take ? 
combine that into one . 
and make that your second step because , to a point the early parts of it , you 're giving the foundations of the nation 
that 's , basically what they 're doing . 
they 're almost trivial with it . 
i agree . 
they were great men , 
and they 're the father of the country and all this . 
he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else . 
if not more . 
that 's true , 
i tell you , 
i saw something on the news maybe two weeks ago . 
i do n't know where you 're from , 
they had , not a table , but a desk in this closet , 
and they had to sit in there by themselves . 
parents were getting really angry about this , because they said , why is my child being put in this closet . 
how is that helping my child . 
they said , we 're giving them isolation time 
and this helps them to think . 
if the isolation concept really works that good , why are our prisons overcrowded ? 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
but 
i definitely agree with parents . 
i think that is a very wrong way to handle disciplining a child . 
putting them in their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms . 
but they showed these rooms on the news 
and they looked like a closet to me with a desk in it , real small . 
but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms . 
i said , how is this helping ? 
either way i definitely had to disagree with that . 
i think that 's not the way to discipline a child by putting him in a closet . 
then the extreme came in , 
so we now isolate them . 
let 's find a middle ground . 
there has to be some sort of discipline , 
let 's put him into a situation where , you crossed the line , 
you broke the rule , 
you 're going to have to pay for it . 
but , it 's going to tax you physically . 
that 's true . 
the kid 's having to give up his , quote , play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong . 
but he 's seeing something constructive come out of it . 
but 
for instance , one of the things they do at my kids school they have what they call caught being good slips . 
and when the kids are in halls and stuff , and if they 're being really good just being excellent , they 're not cutting up and so on . they 're just standing in line , doing whatever they are supposed to , they get one of these caught being good slips . 
and then , when they collect them at the end of each week , they get to go to , what they call their caught being good store , 
and then they get to spend these like money . 
to me , that positive reinforcement , is much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids , because they 're going to be good and try and earn those things to get the positive part of it . 
so , they 're definitely going to work towards being good rather than trying to act up and be bad . 
i think that not only applies inside the public school system , but in society itself . 
there 's been too much negative reinforcement . 
that 's true . 
but i really do try to use positive reinforcement with them at home , also . 
and it really helps . 
but they do when they deserve it . 
but that 's just my personal opinion , 
i do n't think that law will ever change . 
do n't you think ? 
but i do n't know . 
there 's a point of over kill , 
but somewhere you 've got to find an even line . 
there 's so many parents that say , you can deal with a child without spanking them . which is true , 
you can . 
they do things that they need that . 
in your spare time . 
who has spare time ? 
i used to . 
i used to do salt ornaments and things . 
but that was good many years ago 
my spare time 
i usually go do aerobics and read , 
and that 's , about it . 
i understood that . 
i work full time 
and i have two kids 
so my spare time usually involves something with the kids . 
it 's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend . 
we like to , go out , 
family . 
and the things i 've tried to do just do n't look very good , 
and then you have their birth date on them , 
and then you have a little picture of them 
and you frame them and stuff , 
but nothing steady . 
just when i get some spare time here and there i 'll work on it , 
it 's not , like you sit and knit every night . 
not at all . 
i do n't even know how to knit 
and my mother used to knit all the time 
and i do n't even know how to knit , 
i 'm that 's a lost art from this family . 
but , it 's not a very good topic 
it seems like it 's easier just to go out and buy it already made . 
i do n't know what , , it 's like there , 
and you can go to a flea market and stuff 
and there 's just tons of stuff everywhere 
and people just do it in their garage 
and then on weekends they go out and sell it 
and during the week they go back and do some more . 
and they make it cheaper for us to buy . 
it was relaxing creative , 
you felt very creative . 
but , it just was so much time involved and the different steps and things . 
i think we 're okay . 
i think we did the five minutes , 
so we do n't have to keep talking about nothing anymore . 
thank you . 
i hope you have a good rest of your weekend . 
this is a good subject , is n't it ? 
it 's something that you can really talk about . 
i do n't know what we 're going to do about it , 
but it 's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about . 
when they say the middle east , it 's such a big area 
and there 's so many different problems there . 
what do you want to concentrate on . 
it does n't matter to me . 
i 'll tell you something , 
and they 're really quite arrogant about it all . 
they believe that they belong there 
and they 've belonged there forever , 
they consider them second class . 
they 're really quite arrogant about it . 
i do n't know if that contributes to the problem . 
how did they feel about the united states intervening with patriot missiles , 
but , i did n't really talk about that with her . 
, and they 're nothing but really servants for them , 
and they really treat them like second class citizens . 
they do n't really want them around 
but they really do , 
they look down on them . 
and , i do n't know , 
we give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we do n't see all the crime and , all the hurt in the big cities . 
because i 've heard that they 're terrible , 
it 's just like it 's a dog eat dog world . 
and here all my black friends are professionals 
and they do n't go out and abuse drugs 
and they send their kids to school 
and they really encourage them to go to college and stuff . 
so it 's just a different world . 
and they said that you have quite the problem with the ghettos , 
i do n't know , 
but i do n't think it 's any different of a problem than any other major city . 
but i heard that it just has a really bad problem . 
there 's a lot of crime ? 
there 's quite a bit of crime . 
we 're so protected up here , 
it 's really strange . 
our red light district you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life , 
and we 're just so protected . 
so they do n't have that . 
it 's just what do you do for them , 
you want to do something for them , 
but you do n't want to get so directly involved that you 're occupying the country . 
we ca n't get involved in their civil war unfortunately , 
but we 've kind of driven these people out . 
to do it , 
and that 's what they did 
and now they 're asking him for help 
and he 's we ca n't get involved . 
my husband had very strong feelings , 
i think the war ended too soon . 
that 's what everyone says . 
it 's real easy to say that . 
we did n't damage enough of their arsenal . 
we damaged most of it 
but we should have made sure we got everything . 
i do n't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy 's going to do with the rest of his war machine . 
they 're going , it 's not going to hurt us 
so we 're just going to let them go , 
they stuck right to their goals , 
what they were going to say . 
they were playing it very safe , 
what do they say , 
and it 's too bad that he just did n't have the ability just to do it the go ahead to do it . 
he knew what was going to happen , more than any of us . 
because i did n't realize that it was going to make such a mess . 
i feel really sorry for these people , 
these people are middle class people , just like us . 
and you knew this , 
these people are going to come 
and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you . 
of course , you 're just going 
and you 're going to run . 
and it 's just too bad that we could n't see that . 
i just have a feeling that the military involvement is n't over yet . that i still feel like there 's more to come . 
i do n't think this whole issue is settled as far as we 're concerned . 
you know what i was hoping ? 
i know , 
it 's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict 
but , i do n't know , 
i think they should have just done more , 
and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid . 
it 's just so complicated . 
i do n't know , 
you 're damn right , 
i 'm going to protect my family , 
so , i was amazed too . 
i was really , proud of them , though , that they stayed out of it . 
from what i can tell if they had gotten into it , it would have started a whole new war . 
that part scared me . 
and i just saw atomic bomb , 
do you want to start ? 
i 'm trying to think what i 've seen lately . 
did you see the movie ? 
we 've seen that , 
did you like it ? 
it was great , 
have you seen it ? 
i thought it was very well done . 
how about ghost ? 
an , we liked it 
but i did n't think it was as good as all the hype was about it . 
i feel the same way about that too . 
it was okay . 
i could n't see it worth getting a nomination for best picture . 
let 's see , 
but i rent videos , 
do you ? 
you watch many ? 
do you like the classics like gone with the wind and the older movies . 
i 'd like to see those , 
there 's three movies that i keep telling myself that i should see one of these , some day that i have n't seen that are classics . 
that was good . 
that was good , 
and i 've been wanting to see all of it 
but we walk into the video store 
and we 're why do n't we go see this now , 
it 's true . 
one of the movies we saw recently , we saw misery . 
i did n't see that one . 
that was good , 
it was great . 
there 's a couple scenes , at the end 
there is , some blood and everything 
and there 's one really bad scene where there 's not blood but it 's pretty graphic . 
but it 's a really good movie . 
is that the one where the guy gets captured by that women ? 
he 's a writer 
and she 's his biggest fan 
we have n't , 
i saw that one , 
that one was n't that great either . 
it was n't ? 
i did n't think so , 
i heard mixed reviews of that , 
that 's on our list of things to see . 
i know , 
i was curious if you had seen it 
our big thing is movie prices up here 
i think it 's six bucks now in the theaters , 
and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape . 
that 's us too , 
true . 
i know , 
it 's too bad that they 've gotten so expensive . 
have you seen that ? 
it was great . 
it was , 
it 's an odd film 
part of it , 
i never really watched the whole thing . 
he 's , a very odd man 
i think he 's very interesting 
and i liked those two movies of his a lot . 
that was pretty good , though , really . 
it was good , 
when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies . 
you see it for a couple of hours or an hour 
there 's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars , and all the different stuff like that . 
who 's your favorite actress or actor ? 
do n't really know , 
but i 'm a big baseball fan 
that was good , 
i saw that movie too . 
that was very good . 
which one ? 
field of dreams . 
field of dreams was good , 
and , i think , i liked the other movies he 's done . 
no way out was really good 
who was that with ? 
let 's see . 
the title sounds familiar , 
it was a big western , 
and i think it was a three hour movie or two and a half hours , 
and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they had n't cut a lot out . 
but it was really good . 
i might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although i would remember , with him in it . 
how about revenge , 
did you see that with him ? 
i did n't , 
is that any good ? 
i thought it was , 
i like everything he 's done so far . 
it 's one of those movies that it 's not a great movie 
but it was okay . 
we were in the video store today 
and somebody was recommending it to somebody . 
the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else . 
it was not a bad movie . 
i 'll have to catch it one of these days . 
you said you seen no way out ? 
that was excellent . 
that was very good . 
that 's another one i wanted to see . 
in fact , that was advertised not too long ago . 
cable ? 
it was on one of the networks last weekend . or two weeks ago . 
i know i saw something about it . 
i wish i 'd seen it when , it was originally in the theaters 
and i saw part of it again . 
and there 's this one actor , 
it 's really silly that i enjoy him a lot 
i do n't know him . 
you 've probably seen him 
that 's who the guy is . 
do you remember , 
i do n't think so . 
did you ever see the movie star man . 
i do n't know why 
but he 's always a lot of fun in every movie he 's in . 
he was the accountant . 
i know who you mean . 
he was in honey do n't shrink the kids , was n't he ? 
but he 's not . 
that 's the one i was thinking of . 
but i 've seen quite a few movies , 
i enjoy them . 
i think that it 's kind of good entertainment . an escape type of thing . 
how about some of the ads , 
do you go by the ads when you look at them , or the reviews ? 
do they influence you a lot . 
a review usually wo n't make me go see a movie i had n't already wanted to see . 
i want to see it . 
that was pretty good . 
but my girlfriend 's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago , 
i was just going to say , you should see those first if you can . 
if you read the book it 's even better . 
the book was excellent . 
i have n't , 
never read it . 
it was not bad 
but , i expected more , i think . 
so , it was a fun movie . 
do you like his stuff ? 
cocktails , 
that was good , 
they sound familiar . 
i probably saw parts of those . 
a lot of times i 'll start watching a movie 
and i 'm tired 
especially if there 's commercial in it . 
and then the titles might sound familiar 
but i really do n't know what they 're all about . 
they 're all pretty good , 
i think i saw that one . 
i do n't know , 
i 'm not a real great football follower , 
i guess , there are two basic teams that i seem to follow every year . 
i see , 
every year . 
it 's funny . 
how about that . 
but i always enjoyed watching them , 
and there 's always been an interest there . 
it 's kind of same for me , 
i grew up in southern new jersey 
and they were thirty miles right up the river 
i guess you keep those things you grew up with . 
but , they were kind of closer to home when i struck up with them . 
i really do n't know what 's going to take place with the cowboys this year . 
everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they 're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year . 
in a way that happened this past season , 
and i think that 's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there 's a chance that maybe these guys are right , maybe they will come through and do something this year . 
i look for it to be a pretty good year . 
they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago . 
they did , 
they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we were n't familiar with . 
some of them turned out to be pretty good players , 
some of them did n't 
at least we hope it will . 
they make it to the playoffs for the last few years 
but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there . 
and they 've got a lot of the tools to do it , 
but if they ca n't just put it together , 
but they have always been a really strong team . 
and without a whole lot of big name players . 
they have got a few anchors on offense and defense 
and they 've managed with those guys 
and i do n't know . 
once the pressure gets turned on they seem to loose it . 
i guess , 
it 's funny , over the years . 
it 's been a rough road to hoe ever since he left . 
i do n't know why it 's so hard to find a good quarterback these days . 
that says a lot for his ability , though i think . 
he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform , 
every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through . 
but the guy winds up getting hurt every other game . 
i tell you , 
it 's difficult in that guy 's position coming into that because there , he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things . 
they did . 
they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside . 
it 's funny watching them play , 
he 's probably like a lot of quarterbacks , 
when the pressure is really on when it 's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best . 
and i have n't quite figured that out , 
they say , we got to do something now . and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes . 
so , i do n't know 
i 'm looking for a good year . 
i guess we 're always looking for a good year . 
obviously though , do you think they 're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the super bowl this year 
or who do you like to do that this year ? 
i do n't think the cowboys have got a chance . 
i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year , 
and they 'll get close to it . 
they 'll probably get everybody 's hopes up and blow it toward the end . 
so who 's going to beat them ? 
who are they going to blow it to ? 
that 's a good question . 
i 'm not real sure . 
they 'd some big changes , speaking of them . 
they did . 
so , i do n't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team , 
sometimes it brings in new motivation 
and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come . 
but i sure am scared of them giants . 
that 's true . 
those guys are tough . 
they are tough 
and they 're big , 
they 're mean 
and they are going to come right through you if you do n't do something . 
that sure was a fun super bowl to watch this year . 
i was n't pulling for either team . 
but that was just a good football game . 
and it 's funny , . 
but he 's a good quarterback . 
he 's got a good arm , 
sometimes it 's too good because he throws too hard . 
l a you mean ? 
i mean l a , 
we 've been trying . 
i was just up there , 
and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground . 
that will make the skiers happy . 
they got that much up in the mountains just west of there . 
you bet . 
good to talk to you . 
you guys have a good time , 
keep those printers coming . 
we 'll do it . 
go ahead . 
do i still feel that the soviet union , as such , is still a threat to the civilized western world ? 
absolutely . 
and my reasons are based upon not only what i see on the newspapers , but . 
i guess i do n't see them as much of a threat as they used to be , 
but i think just the instability of the country right now is , sort of scary . 
the soviet union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat . 
and they were all shooting state of the art soviet weapons . 
do i consider them a threat ? 
absolutely . 
they 're teaching terrorism . 
and let me tell you , 
they are nothing nice to go up against . 
these guys are top of the line . 
when they graduate from there , they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world . 
and they are very , very good at what they do . 
so until i see the entire , quote , old guard of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear , preferably buried , i still consider them a threat . 
i guess that 's what concerns me the most . is they 're so unstable that somebody like that could make decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people . 
each one of those sectors has got a soviet general over the troops that are there . 
there 's probably five or six , which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs , that are in positions over some of these soviet states . 
it looks like it 's come close to that as it is . 
they 're showing remarkable restraint . 
and they , would level entire areas . 
and there wo n't be anything left alive . 
and they can do that in about four minutes . 
if the bombs do n't get you , if the bullets do n't get you , then the nerve gas definitely will get you . 
the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time . 
they drink that much fuel . 
have you , 
i take it you have n't spent any time in the military ? 
i have n't . 
as a civilian that 's never been attached to any form of the military , i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in , never did make the newspapers . 
but , during that same time frame , did n't you get some feeling , that they 're getting all these weapons and stuff ? 
did n't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff ? 
you mean in the most recent conflict ? 
definitely . 
i think we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too . 
it 's bad enough that the soviets do it . 
it 's a matter of money , to a certain extent . 
it 's scary to know that they 're supplying that many people with weapons . especially when it 's to the south of us . 
the ones to the south are more regional conflict . 
they 're not really that worried about invading north . 
they 've got a screwed up situation , 
i 'll give them that . 
the situation down there is weird 
and it 's very screwed up . 
inflation is out of this world 
and the governments , which our government has technically supported for years , are corrupt as all get out . 
and generally the people , are getting screwed , 
and they 're tired of it , 
and they 're willing to try anything to get out from under it , even if that means going to communism . 
that 's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing . 
and he 's had his problems with some of the old guard himself . 
true . 
i do n't know , 
i sure would n't turn my back on them . 
i thought that was great . 
but by no means do i endorse or approve pulling everybody out . 
it may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there . 
but you still better have the key players in place , if something does go down . even if it 's a regional conflict . 
but it 's got to be able to walk the walk . 
it 's got to have the stuff to back up what it 's saying . 
if you 've only got a token force there , you ca n't hold your ground . 
at least they 're learning a little bit from history . 
i usually ride my bike . 
i have a stationary bike and a regular bike . 
and when i can , i like to ride my regular bike outside , because it 's so much nicer . 
the stationary bike is so boring . 
boring . 
but i have head phones , 
plus i have it in the living room 
, or we have a fish tank , 
so i watch the fish . 
whatever i can do to keep myself occupied . 
it kind of takes the time away 
and then usually after i 'm done riding the bike , just to cool myself down , i usually take a walk , 
and that just kind of gets me , to where i 'm not quite as tired i guess . 
but it 's definitely a task . 
you think so ? 
i ca n't say that i really enjoy it . 
i wish that i did enjoy it more , 
but i do it because i have to not because i want to . 
i bought a stationary bike , 
but i find that if i sit on that seat too long , it hurts . 
and i have n't figured how to get that soft , 
and i love it . 
i just love it . 
so is it just women that go there ? 
it 's totally women . 
i think that 's what 's my biggest problem with going to a health club . 
because i do n't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise . 
so i have tried to just do stuff at home 
and i just feel conscious about it . 
i 'm not big or anything , 
but i still do n't like other people watching me . 
i like to be able to sweat , have my hair a mess . feel that if my bathing suit slips a little bit i do n't have to be conscious of it being a little bit too low . 
and my bathing suit 's just one piece , 
so there 's no big deal all the way around , 
but i do n't have to be conscious of what i 'm doing or how i 'm doing it . 
and it 's a total free relaxation . 
because you can do what you want . 
you 're a female , 
and they 've got such fantastic equipment in there . 
that 's great . 
how , 
and i love the water aerobics . 
i love the water aerobics . 
do they have a pool 
they 've got a nice one . 
they have two types of water aerobics . 
i 've heard that that 's really good for you to do . 
it pushes you because you 're pushing against the water in itself . 
because you 're pushing it yourself . 
so you 're doing it yourself . 
so you do n't really feel like you 're really working that hard , do you ? 
when you 're in the water ? 
the only thing that i ever felt was , every time i stop and start going again , because i end up getting two jobs once in a while . 
i end up having to quit for a while . 
that 's funny , 
i never would have thought of that . 
so they just wear them right into the pool . 
are they water shoes ? 
no big deal one way or the other . 
that 's really funny . 
so no big deal . 
but it 's fun . 
so , how often do find yourself going ? 
if you 're doing it on a regular basis , how often do you go ? 
i try to make it at least three times a week . 
for a while i was doing it every day . just , going five days a week . 
i wish that i could make myself exercise every day . 
but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week . which i do n't feel like is enough , 
but it 's at least something . 
i have to force myself to do it , like i said , because to me , i really do n't enjoy it . 
but i know that i have to do it . 
it 's not a question of whether i want to . 
and i 'd be at the swimming pool . actually about four thirty because they start at five to six , 
so i was there by four thirty , every night . 
and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet . 
because no matter what i did or how i did it , i invariably got myself wet . 
so it 's your choice where you want to go , 
but , i enjoyed it higher . 
i 'm sorry . 
that 's okay . 
did you ever try that ? 
i have a bad back , 
so i 'm very limited what i do . 
it 's like i can walk , 
especially when you 're on cement or anything that 's hard , 
it will bother me . 
it will bother me . 
i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you , would n't it ? 
what pushed me that way though , basically was the fact that when i went in there , is was n't for the water aerobics . 
i went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles . 
and she said , go for the swimming pool . 
she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor . 
she says in fact you get more . 
i said because i 'm not a swimmer . 
i like water . 
i 'm not scared of it . 
i guess i could swim across the pool , 
but i 'm no swimmer per se . 
but i found that this worked really well . 
and i came out of there 
and i saw my stomach going down well . 
i dropped almost twenty pounds . just by watching what i ate . 
and they fix you up with a diet , which worked real good . 
what if you 're already on one ? 
i mean , 
what ? 
a diet ? 
when you go in there , they would n't make you do theirs . would they ? 
they have nothing to do with that . 
and they go over all your health and all your history , 
and they show you everything to do , and how to do it , and the whole nine yards . 
so it became part of the package , 
so i went through it . 
it worked out well . 
but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program . 
is that what you 're saying ? 
you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too . 
i see , 
so it 's less than what you pay now for going in there , after all this time . 
so it 's like when i got laid off , i went back in there , and start all over again because it had been a while since i 'd done it . 
so i get all the same treatment again . 
so it 's kind of nice . 
like i said , i like it . 
i like the heat . 
i jump out of the swimming pool , 
and i love it . 
that would be really nice . 
i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore . 
but that 's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did . 
i knew i was pushing too far . 
it 's no big deal . 
it 's fun . 
it 's fun . 
i 've gotten on the bike . 
and they 've got the stepping bike , where you step . 
and i 've enjoyed that , watching how well i can walk up and down stairs . 
but most of the others to me are very dull . 
but i got talked into the bike instead . 
and i do n't know , 
i 'm considering maybe even buying one of those too . 
but i 'm not sure if i 'll get benefit out of both of them . 
i do n't know if it would really do any good having both of them . 
which one do you feel is better , since you use them both ? 
i get bored very easily . 
the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit . 
it would depend upon which one you want . 
but if i were you , i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while . 
because you can buy a month 's membership . and see what you feel is best for you . 
because i jump on the bike here at home . 
the handle bars go up and down , 
so i can sit there and read and listen to music , like what you said , 
and it has no effect on me . 
so it 's boring . 
one year public service for everybody . 
that was it ? . 
who wants to start this one ? 
i do n't know , 
i 've been sitting here thinking , 
because it took a couple tries before i found somebody . 
i 'm not really sure what i think about this . 
the first thing is if it 's going to be mandatory , it 's got to be mandatory , 
everybody , not just poor people and all that but senators ' sons and all that stuff too . 
everybody 's got to do it . 
i do n't know , 
it 'd probably be good , 
that does n't sound right . 
i guess i see overall beneficial , if we 're going from that point of view . 
. in the past , 
i do n't know how old you are , 
and many of my peers were being drafted . 
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever . 
but i felt strongly then that even if they did n't feel like they could kill someone , or go into a military situation , that they could help the country in other ways . be it cleaning out lots , in their neighborhood or , whatever kind of community or public service might be available . 
and i guess i see that as not so much a demand but a privilege . 
since we live here and we all benefit , rich , poor or in between there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest . 
i just see that as maybe a good idea . 
and i find ways to turn some of that back to others . 
and i guess i ca n't see that as being something to really object to . 
you 're going to go and fill pot holes and , all that stuff . 
i do n't know . 
i could see a gamut of different kinds of opportunities . 
i ca n't , imagine what kind of bureaucracies we 'd get into and expense having it be full time , 
you 're going to go to this camp 
back in the depression , the c c c , the construction corps that went out and did things . that was great , 
it was needed , 
it gave some folks some jobs , 
and we got some great public works out of it . 
but i do n't see that as being necessary now . 
i can see it being done on a regular schedule . 
everybody has to put in so many hours of public service in a given time , perhaps . 
i guess i see all of us benefiting , 
but i see so much going on , that 's bad . 
and this would give them a chance to have some positive self-esteem . 
something that they turn , back . 
and also you feel more like you 're actually part of the community if you 've done something , in it . 
that 's right . 
you take pride in that , and get some positive feedback from those who benefit , besides yourself . 
and i see it being most beneficial if it 's in at least the area where the person lives . 
definitely . 
it might not be the same neighborhood , but the same city or county , because then you 're coming in contact with it . 
it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual , on going . 
that would , be a nightmare . 
and just getting it going . 
i , see a lot of things like scouting boys clubs , girls clubs , things like that , that kind of get into that citizenship the looking after the environment sort of thing 
and i guess , i do n't see this being that different . but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in , and would take a turn in . 
do you have kids ? 
not yet . 
in about six months we will . 
good . 
you 'll have a little time . 
when i was teaching school i saw so many kids that were at loose ends and that did n't really have a purpose . 
and i can see some really significant things coming out of it . 
but that would be a part of selling it to the community . 
the adults ahead of it would probably never serve and to each succeeding generation . 
i do n't know , 
around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for . 
and i 've seen it in other states too . 
they have , that here . , 
i do n't know , 
and there were those that said , you ca n't do that , i 'm sure . 
it was interesting because that 's an interesting question . 
should these people be allowed to or not ? 
and i had n't even thought about the other end of that . 
that 's an interesting situation . 
i had n't thought of that . 
i do n't remember for sure now . 
and i do n't know about your part of the country , 
but down here in the last year plus there 's just been more of a turn toward environmental concerns , 
and they 've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said , it 's not feasible , 
it 's not a good idea . 
and , i see that as being a change for the positive . kind of along the same line as the mandatory thing . 
but then they lost , too much business . 
it 's just a part of everyone 's consciousness . 
and then it kind of just went out of vogue . 
and i 'm worried that the same thing will happen . 
it 's like environmentalism was really big for a couple of years 
and even if it 's not environmentally safe , who cares . 
there have been too many other things that it 's done that for , just in my life . 
and if you look at history at all , you see that we go from one side to the other on just about any subject , that one might care to bring up . 
but , it is comforting to me to see more concern about some of these things that cost us money . 
it makes me feel better . 
it 's just probably a good thing that the oil 's burning and may , make some people realize that this stuff runs out . 
what was it when we had the last oil crisis ? 
and we started getting smart 
and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth . 
or we 'll suddenly be in the dark and say , now we do n't have the ability to go on to some new technology . 
my dad 's in the solar energy business , 
so i wonder sometimes if he knows what he 's doing . 
just about anybody you could name , whether i voted for them or not makes decisions that i just ca n't go along with . 
but that 's why they 're there and not me . 
i do n't want the stress . 
do you want to go first ? 
you can go first , 
or i will . 
you go ahead . 
i 'm going to tell you what i 'd have . 
it sounds fantastic . 
and you put a bay leaf and put some red pepper over it . 
you can either use the kind that comes in the little can 
and you put a little bit of that over it . 
if you use the dried kind ? then you would only use two of them . 
and you put that in there , 
and then you pour two bottles of beer over it . 
two pounds . 
two pounds , 
leave the shells on them so they wo n't just roll up . 
and you pour the beer over the top of it , 
and you cover it . 
then you remove it , 
and they can just dip it , 
and they shell it as they eat it . 
and what you do is , you just wash it , 
and you core it . 
a glass dish . 
but it 's got to have one that has a cover on it . 
and then you cook it for seven minutes on high . 
and you rotate it one time . 
and are you cooking the whole head at one time ? 
when you core it , you be real careful so you wo n't knock your flowers off . 
i see . 
and you just set it in there , 
and you microwave it on high for seven minutes , 
and you turn it one time . 
and i mix it all together . 
and i shred up some just regular white cheese . 
and after that 's cooked , you take it out and pour this on top of it , 
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that . 
and , it 's done . 
that sounds fantastic . 
it is good . 
and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that . 
and you have all the different seasonings and stuff , 
and then i just fix little individual cups for them . 
and it 's not much work . 
but it looks like it . 
i bet it tastes good too . 
and usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up , and put some color into it , 
and i 'll lay those on top of my salad to make it look nice and things like that . 
how many could you serve ? 
it usually serves six . 
i figured about that . 
that 's good . 
out here , we have so many ethnic people . 
and it depends , out here ? 
so it 's hard , 
and they 're big on finger food here , too chicken wings and ribs , and that kind of stuff . barbecue and cooking out in the yard , when it 's nice . barbecue outside , chicken and that kind of stuff . 
they are good . 
but that 's one good thing about living down here is , usually anybody that comes over even if it 's out of town guests and stuff , they want our cooking . 
of course . 
they want it from down here . 
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is . 
it 's similar . 
it 's similar . 
it 's got a taste of its own , 
but it is similar to , because you only eat the , tails of it . 
it does ? 
does , it look like a lobster ? 
it looks more like a crab . 
it looks more like a crab . 
are they thin , long or wide ? 
i guess it looks more like a cross between a crab and a lobster . 
because it 's small like that 
and we call them mud bugs . 
but they 're fantastic tasting . 
they are so good . 
everybody , 
it 's the season for them right now . 
and where did you say you were from ? 
i love blackened the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff . 
! we have a few places up here that do that . 
and if ever i see it on the menu , i always get it . 
it is so good . 
you know , 
how do they do the blackened ? 
i did have . 
i do n't have it now . 
i guess you could cook it in that too , 
you now , 
but i do n't know . 
i never have . 
does it have to get extremely hot ? 
but it does n't burn or anything like that . 
i see . 
i see . 
and , it comes in a bottle , 
you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would , prepare it any other time ? 
is that what you 're saying ? 
and that is so good . delicious . 
but you do have to have it hot when you cook it your pan . 
it does have to be really hot when you put it in . 
but it 's not like it 's burned , 
and it is so good . 
it is . 
i love it . 
i have a passion for all that type of different tastes . 
that 's why i enjoy going to restaurants and trying different things . 
i would love to . 
you ought , to come down . 
you do n't have to go that far south . 
but of course , the further south you go , the better the food is , as far as i 'm concerned . 
is that right ? 
and fact is , we 're going to take a vacation this year . 
and we 're only going down there for the food , though . 
where do you go when you go there ? 
we go to the french quarters and stuff like that . 
and i have some friends that live down there . 
and so , usually we do n't go to the tourist ones . 
we go to the ones that they tell us to go to . 
i see . 
and we went to this one , 
it was called the back porch . 
and they were cooking the stuff while we went on this boat ride . 
and then we came back and ate , out on this back porch . 
that 's nice . 
there 's no where you can miss . 
i have never gone to a restaurant , and not just been so full , 
it 's so good . 
i 'm trying to think what they call their soup . 
i do n't know . 
jumbo . 
is that with seafood ? 
you can even make it with chicken 
or you can make it with seafood . 
you can ? 
that looks good too . 
and it looks delicious . 
and i 'll tell you what . 
we do a thing , 
i wonder , 
the assumption is that it is a problem , 
but it 's not clear to me that it is . 
it 's a problem if those voting do n't represent the population demographically , or in terms of their opinions . 
that 's interesting , 
i feel that it 's a problem also , 
but , i see your point on that . 
poor blacks , for example , vote very little , and things like that 
and i assume that they would vote differently if they were voting , than your average voter . 
but i do n't know if that 's the case . 
in fact i 've heard of studies that suggest that that is n't . 
apparently they do n't think it 's a problem . 
i guess not , 
i vote religiously , 
i really do . 
i guess i 'm a fan of democracy 
and wish i could vote on more things frankly . 
that 's right , 
we have these state initiatives now . 
and that was whatever , ten years ago 
and you had to vote for yes or no on each of them 
and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them 
and it was incredibly complicated and difficult . 
they said we do n't want to have to decide all these things , 
that 's why we hire people to make these decisions for us . 
i kind of feel the opposite , though . 
i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things . 
i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us 
but they 're not speaking for me . 
i would n't mind having more votes than i get to have , frankly . 
that 's true . 
anyone who does n't vote , it 's fine with me as long as i can have their vote . 
that would make me happy though . 
maybe not in a deep philosophical sense , but in a selfish sense , it probably would . 
i do n't know , 
it 's interesting , 
some countries voting is obligatory . 
is that true ? 
i did n't know that , 
that is one solution to it . 
i do n't know how i feel about that . 
that 's not really democratic . 
not what i 'd consider truly democratic . 
and it 's not for me to say that they 're not . 
here you have the right to vote 
and they simply define it as a duty there . 
just as we have a duty to pay taxes , 
is that democratic ? 
we do n't have the right to pay taxes in this country , 
we have the duty to pay taxes . 
it 's a duty . 
and in that country it 's a duty to pay taxes 
and it 's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent . 
and it 's not clear to me that , that 's so much less democratic . 
. i do n't know , 
but part of me rebels against that , 
it 's complex question when you start thinking about it , is n't it . 
and some people do n't vote , 
and i think they 're eligible for a fine . 
i do n't know if they actually are fined or what happens , 
but you 're eligible for some sort of fine if you do n't vote . 
that 's interesting . 
i have people here that i know that have never registered to vote . 
and i think they feel they can criticize if they do n't . 
i told them if they do n't vote they do n't have the right to criticize . 
that 's how i feel . 
and you can say something 
but if you do n't vote , part of me feels like , if you did n't vote , you get what 's coming to you . 
that 's right , 
and certainly that 's true in the overall , 
no one individual that 's true for 
but for the population as a whole , i sort of feel that way . 
especially when , they do n't vote for someone because they do n't like any of them and then the person gets in and they do n't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for , or something like that . 
i think it is too . 
sometimes it is a difficult choice . 
you do n't feel as though you have much of a choice , 
it 's funny because technically you do . 
you have the right to do a write in candidate . 
but of course that 's not really a vote . 
it does n't really gain anything . 
it really does n't , 
and so it 's a complicated situation , 
i do n't know , 
i 'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting , but just because of a job opportunity . 
i see . 
i 'm interested . 
i 'm not . 
not , 
i just wondered . 
so i 'm really quite curious , how that would work , to have both , 
soviet bloc countries you are obliged to vote too . 
in fact , it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for , up until fairly recently 
and , that 's what i think of when i think of you 're obliged to vote . 
i do n't know , 
part of me is wary 
and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty . 
maybe they should , 
perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age . required to register and vote for four years , 
that 's a thought , 
or certain privileges come from voting which are n't that important but are nice to have , 
i do n't know . 
maybe it should go with a driver 's license . 
actually 
that 's considered a privilege , not a right . 
that is a privilege , 
technically it 's a privilege , 
but most people think of it as a right . 
in other words if the government denies you a driver 's license , people get very upset . 
but actually it 's a privilege , which is allowed to be revoked . 
it is . 
that 's correct . 
maybe it should be . 
except if you 're a felon , 
if you 're a felon it is taken away from you . 
they will take away your right to vote , under certain circumstances . 
that 's right . 
so we do n't have a great solution yet do we , 
i think i checked that as a question i 'd be willing to discuss too . 
i have n't . 
a republic , not a democracy . 
where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues . 
in other words , you vote for representatives . 
and the whole idea was presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person , and , a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy , 
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single bad ruler or something , you can have a tyranny of the majority . 
and he makes a very passionate , good argument for why you do n't want some things decided by democratic process , 
because anytime you have a majority they can change the law in a fully democratic process 
and there are cases when you do n't want that to be the case . 
if there 's some minority that people do n't like because of racial hatred or something like that , the majority can just simply vote against them . 
and cases like that need to be constrained , 
and i agree , except that i do n't trust the people who are appointed to vote . 
sometimes i think we have that right now , with congress . 
i think they 're looking after their own self preservation more than they 're actually looking after the good of the country . 
and , so they work on that job . 
and they 're all fools , 
that kind of thing . 
and , there 's a notion that somehow , if someone is n't as much as a government person , they 're less corrupt and they 're more likely to be good which is really strange , 
i was just trying to think about how i dress for work , 
and what i usually do on the weekend is lay out five outfits 
and then progressively through the week , i 'll wear nicer looking things 
that 's a good way to approach it . 
i do plan my clothes a week in advance . 
actually , i plan them a month in advance . 
i usually do a month at a time , 
so i do n't repeat an outfit . 
but i do n't work outside of school . 
i work in the computer lab at school 
so i can just wear whatever i have on for school , 
and then in the winter time it 's jeans or pants . 
college is so casual , 
you really do n't want to dress up unless you , have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that , 
where i work , it 's pretty casual , 
i guess it 's more like a college campus 
and they dress up when customers are coming in , or when we have department meetings or something like that . 
that 's good that they 're so casual . 
and he 's a computer engineer . 
and whenever he was going to school , he was expecting to to wear a tie or a dress shirt everyday . 
and he just loves it . 
that 's what i 've heard . 
i would hate to be in that atmosphere . 
but they just moved into the new building , 
he calls it the new building . 
i do n't know , 
it 's where all the executives are . 
i see . 
he was so excited about going . 
but he did n't carry any ties or anything because he just went over there with that attitude , if i do n't take it then they wo n't make me wear it . 
that 's true , 
that 's a good idea . 
he 's not really into all that . 
he would wear it if he had to for his job and all 
and also to get off the clothing , the smokers , you know , how they have the different designated areas for smokers and stuff . 
i think that 's great . 
do you smoke ? 
so much smoke in the air . 
the smoking area , it 's closed in , 
and if you do n't smoke and you go in there , 
everybody that goes in there smokes 
so it 's full of smoke when you go in there . 
i used to smoke a long time ago . 
i used to burn my clothes , talking about getting back to clothes . 
i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes . 
that 's one of the reason that i stopped . 
you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college . 
when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions 
she always had to have a lot of clothes . 
that 's how i am 
i was n't either , 
my daughter , she 's real good at finding sales though . 
me to , 
she 'll buy a lot clothes , at the end of seasons and just have them for the next year . 
and she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and buys clothes . 
so i 'm still learning how , 
and i 'm getting much better at it 
and i 'm going to be able to make my own clothes . 
that 's great . 
but i just have n't fit it into my schedule yet , 
that 's something that i 'd be very interested in learning . 
because clothes are really expensive , 
they 're outrageous ! 
it 's marked up . 
just a little shell to go under a suit . 
it is really outrageous 
i never understood this then , 
but i do now , 
but she never would buy me the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars , 
and she always told me it was because i was still growing 
and she was n't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week . 
especially to pay that kind of money for it . 
she had a little boy 
and she finally learned that you just can not do this . 
so now she finds the basement sales just like everybody else . 
that 's the best way to shop . 
i always thought my mom was being mean to me 
but i look back at it now 
i 'm going to raise mine the same way . 
i do n't know , 
it 's just incredible . 
i try to always catch the sales . 
always . 
and 
and you just have to keep buying them . 
if you 're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the quality is really not that great for the price that you pay . 
there 's always a reason why they 're on sale . 
so that has a lot to do with it . 
and it was really pretty , 
it had leather designs and some other little things on it 
and i just thought it was so pretty 
and i got it at a real good price , 
that 's great . 
and it was so pretty , 
and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why it was so cheap . 
and that 's why it was so cheap , although , it 's not really noticeable from the outside , 
but still , it 's really not a good quality . 
the defect . 
they do n't really buy the first quality , 
they buy the second . 
they 'll send them back every time . 
i have n't gotten really involved in anything extensive in car repairs in probably a year or so . 
i had a similar thing , that i 've worked on cars ever since i was a kid . 
and that was some time ago , 
i try to buy as simple a car as possible . 
i know what you mean . 
or fuel injected , 
and if the fuel injection system breaks down , there 's no way in the world you 're going to work on that . 
there 's no way . 
i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it 
and a woman asked me what that meant 
and i said that means that i ca n't work on it . 
basically that 's it . 
regular gas engine , 
and that engine i understand , 
i can actually work on that engine . 
and basically it was a motor 
and you did n't have all the other junk around it , 
and you could get to it to work on it . 
i had to change the water pump in that , here about a year ago . 
and it was really fairly easy . 
and you can just stand there and work on it . 
the hardest part about water pump changes is getting all the junk off , before you can get too it . 
that 's true . 
you 're right , 
i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went . 
that 's kind of the way i was , 
i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went , 
and i do n't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together . 
when i came back here , i brought the car back here 
and i do n't know , 
though for what you could get for one , you might as well drive it over a cliff . 
so i found a outfit down here to rebuild it . and reinstalled that 
and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time . 
i do n't think i 'd know where to start with a diesel . 
that 's true . 
i think the closest thing i 've come to a diesel is , i 've worked for a tractor repair shop when i was in high school 
and we used to overhaul farm tractors basically , 
and they were nearly all diesel , 
but as far as cars i 've never , never been involved with them . 
and you can get to them . 
you can get to them , 
and the ones in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with . 
i 've had a lot of good service out of that car , 
but i finally gave it to my son 
and he drove it literally into the ground . 
and he finished it off . 
i guess you 're right 
the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status . 
i do n't know exactly why . 
i 'm beginning to wonder where do you get gas at . 
i do n't know if it 's still limited like it was , 
what , 
the availability ? 
you mean the diesel availability ? 
i do n't notice 
but maybe because i 'm not looking for it . 
i really liked it . 
but it turns out a pickup was n't what i really needed , 
but sure enjoyed it . 
that 's what i like because , they 've got plenty of power , 
that was a short stroke engine 
it could really wind up . 
and it 's fairly easy to work with because there 's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong , 
i had a dodge pickup several years ago , 
and i ca n't remember the size of the engine 
it was a three oh , seven or something like that , 
but i remember working on those cars , 
you 'd open the hood 
and there was basically nothing in there but an engine , and a few things . 
now , you open the hood 
and it 's scary . 
and i was look under the hood of that the other day 
and like you say , you can see the road . 
it 's amazing . 
if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to . 
you could stand in there if you really wanted to , i guess . 
and he was showing it to me 
and we 're looking under the hood 
and everything 's nice and clean 
and i said where are the other three . 
and he 'd never really thought about it . 
and he says hopefully i wo n't have to change them , before i trade it off . 
it 's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall . 
within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i 've paid any attention to it . 
and it had all the air pump and all that stuff . 
and that was really a mess back under there in that van . 
and all that stuff loads the motor down . 
so it 's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things . 
but that 's one good thing 
it 's that one that 's about an inch and a half wide . 
i have n't had to replace the thing yet . 
and i had to get all those off when i was replace that water pump . 
and i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where . 
it 's kind of like the inside dual on a truck . 
when one of them breaks , it 's not the outside one , 
you bet , 
everything else 's got to come off first . 
everything 's got to come off . 
it 's a pleasure meeting you . 
how many times have you done this ? 
so i guess i 've done probably seven or eight of them . 
this is the first one in a week or so . 
i have n't gotten any calls in two weeks , 
so i do n't know , if it 's tapering off , or what . 
if it 's winding down or what . 
i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting answers . 
let you go . 
thanks for talking . 
i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on 
and so there 's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really did n't have a clue as to what was happening . 
looking back maybe some of the things that i know now , i 'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives . 
that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about , 
because we never went to war . 
i do n't think we were committed to winning it and getting out 
and i feel like it went on and on . 
i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman 
and i 'm not sure that 's our role , 
i agree with that , 
i was fairly young at the time too , 
i really do n't have very many memories about it at all , in fact . 
do n't you think that maybe that 's why we had it this time ? 
i do think that , it 's been too long in coming 
so many people were opposed to the war , 
what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it 
and those guys were there doing their duty . 
that 's right , 
they were n't there by choice 
and i think that we learned from that 
and i think it 's one of those things that you learn the hard way . 
it was a tragic mistake , 
the way that they have been treated over the years 
and i 'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally , on so many of the people . 
i do n't think you can 
and i agree with you that i think that the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in every aspect of it 
and i agree with you also , that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war . 
they 're still not settled over there . 
they 're not . 
i think we 're going to end up back there in a few years if not sooner . 
and then he has backed out , 
he has pulled out . 
so why are n't you helping us ? 
i think it would too . 
i do n't think he would do that , 
i think we learned too much of the effects . 
i agree with that . 
whether it was justified or not , i know , that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause . 
i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and beat the communism , 
but i think somewhere that got lost in the long term effects of the war 
he said that 's what we were going there to do 
and he did what he said 
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where it would have turned into more of a police action . or more of a political action you getting into their governmental affairs which you really ca n't do as another country . 
my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries 
and we have so many problems here at home that we do n't address . 
that we do n't get fixed . 
that 's right . 
i know . 
and i believe that we have to have a military 
and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us . 
i think there 's a lot of waste 
if they could just cut out all the fat and get it lean , and start addressing some of the other issues , i think we could take care of everything . and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world who just end up using things against us later on anyway . 
i know , 
i think that maybe we 're not their big bad enemy any more . 
and i think that 's good , 
i think that 's a good , 
a lot of good has come from this one . 
i think so too . 
because we said earlier , that , a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of that war 
so , i do think that , we 've learned from it , 
i wish there were n't war . 
but i do think we learned . 
they still do n't know what they were there for . 
there was no feeling of accomplishment , no goal , 
we went in 
but what did we do . 
we lost lives 
and what were we trying to do . 
who knows . 
that 's true . 
and , i think you 're right , 
i think you 're right there . 
i do remember when it was over . 
i remember when they were coming home . 
but , i remember the feeling back then , 
right now , i feel like this country has been behind this war . 
there 's a lot of people that are n't for war . 
i 'm not for war , 
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right . 
i just remember , our guys are over there 
and it 's sad 
and we should n't be fighting a war 
but there was no , let 's support them . 
i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity 
because those kind of people , they 're the kind of people who 've always got to have a cause , whether it 's good , bad of indifferent . 
they 've got to have a cause 
and , nobody says because you 're supporting the troops that you 're supporting the war . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
you have to support the people that are there . 
that 's right . 
and for some reason those people do n't see that . 
they do n't see it as supporting the folks , the people . 
they do n't 
i would agree with you there . 
i agree . 
he said look , 
i 'm sorry that you 're opposed to the war . 
there 's a lot of us that are opposed to war 
but you 're not helping the people that are over there by what you 're doing . 
and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that . 
they 're not helping anybody . 
that 's the whole point , 
they 're not doing anything for anybody except themselves . 
that 's true . 
and i do n't even know what they 're doing for themselves . 
giving a soapbox to stand on . 
but i 'm glad we 've learned . 
and i 'm especially sorry for the people that have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally , 
because until the past four or five years , nobody ever really worried about that , for them . 
that 's true . 
i do n't know . 
do you have anything else you want to say on this ? 
i guess not . 
i think this is the first time that i have n't been cut off by the computer . 
i know , 
we get cut off all the time , too . 
usually i can talk all day 
but this is something to me that 's sad . 
it is . 
have a good day 
and i appreciate the conversation . 
same here . 
what do you think about the metric system ? 
have you tried much with it ? 
with an engineering , degree , of course , it 's a whole lot easier . 
to use you mean , 
it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it 's all decimal . 
and it 's so easy to convert from one set of units to another . 
i 've lived both in the united states and in a country where they do use the metric system 
so i 've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over . 
the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and , pounds to kilograms , 
that 's right . 
and , i think that 's what hung people up the most is they went wait a minute , 
how on earth am i every going to do the math ? 
and get used to it from scratch , 
cause i still ca n't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters 
but i 'm perfectly comfortable using either . 
it 's hard to take it seriously . 
and as long as both were given , you , basically , just do n't read the kilometers per hour , 
you just say , read the miles per hour one , 
the other one must be for someone else . 
that 's right . 
i do n't know , 
and we inherited this mess from them 
that 's right , 
it 's all their fault . 
it 's more our fault than theirs at this point because they saw the light , 
i do n't know why they were more able than we were 
except i think , that they probably just said we 're just going to start using the things now 
is much more necessary for them than for us . 
that 's true , 
that 's probably true 
there 's an expression for that , 
with eyes on the past , backing confidently into the future . 
i 've never heard that one , 
that 's very nice . 
so i 'm all for the metric system and converting over 
i guess , my feeling is the way to do it is to just start giving weights have a very brief transition period and then just start giving kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert . 
remember me getting a package of something that said one pound , 
this is a package of dates , 
it , was , presumably something you weigh fairly precisely , 
it said one pound 
i do n't think it could ever happen with a quick transition . 
you do n't ? 
i think that would be the easiest way 
but human nature being such as it is , i would think it would take , probably , two or three years before people could completely cut the cord . 
that 's what i was thinking by quick transition , 
at midnight , tonight we all switch over or anything . 
did they switch ? 
i believe so , 
and i think they did it overnight 
cause you ca n't do it gradually . 
that 's an example of something you ca n't do gradually . 
that 's true . 
it does . 
interesting . 
that was something that had to be done quickly because of external circumstances , 
i 'm sure . 
so i think it 's essential that it 's done 
a little more attention to human psychology 
and after all , the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers , 
so they do n't deal with thirty seconds of an inch 
and so 
the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented . 
really , i think . 
i saw that , 
i saw that the other day . 
i do n't drink soda pop , 
so 
things like that are a good start 
that 's true . 
sure have enjoyed our talk . 
get back to what you 're doing 
and i 'll do the same . 
i enjoyed talking with you too . 
do you do a lot of cooking in your family ? 
i do some every now and then , 
i work 
and my wife 's home during the day 
so she usually ends up doing most of it . 
when i was single we used to always cook , around the house . 
do you like to cook . 
i really like it , 
there 's a few dishes , 
so we definitely have different tastes , 
but that 's neat though , because you get to have different stuff . 
i 'm a pretty bad cook . 
i 'm pretty bad . 
my husband is really good , 
he put himself through college working in restaurants . 
and he 's much better cook than i am , 
so , when i was home i still cooked a lot 
and now , i went back to work about a year and a half ago 
so , one of the things that he took over was the cooking 
and the kids are thrilled , 
they 're really happy , that i do n't cook anymore . 
they 're preferring it now . 
they say dad , let dad cook mom , 
let him do it 
but so do you have kids ? 
you obviously have one . 
two , 
you have two . 
one is nine months 
and the other is two and a half . 
two and half . 
i was just going to say , makes a difference in what you eat does n't it . 
or are you not at that stage yet ? 
it does . 
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we , eat . 
she makes six different meals , 
like to have one thing , 
the other one like hot dogs , 
i could n't . 
i could n't do that , 
but 
let me think , 
i was thinking of the one recipe that we made . 
i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy , 
what 's that . 
it has a french name , 
and you pour it over rice , 
what is that , 
i ca n't even remember what the recipe 's name is anymore , 
and it sounds sort of funny 
but it tastes really good . 
so we had a lot of seafood before we moved down here . 
and that sounds delicious to me . 
that sounds great . 
we 're just thinking of having , a dinner party . 
we went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game , 
they had a murder mystery , 
and you came dressed as one of the characters 
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner , 
and it was really fun 
and so we were going to try doing it ourselves , 
and that kind of interrupted the game , 
and then you can make that ahead 
that 's another thing 
i have a problem with my wife , 
she does n't like the beef dishes . 
she likes the chicken and fish , 
and , like i said , we always ate beef and pork a lot , 
i know , 
my husband did too . 
and they always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table . 
red meat , 
plenty of good red meat . 
my dad could eat , a meal with out any vegetables at all . 
my dad would n't know what to do . 
that you do , 
that 's just part of it . 
but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly , 
there was dishes that he really enjoyed , eating . 
there were several things that he liked 
but it never was really , something that he would have chosen . 
it 's just that i cooked 
so he had to put up with it . 
but there was one thing that he could n't stand 
and that was soybeans . 
i tried it once or twice 
and he just could not eat it , 
i was limited . 
it 's hard to get a protein content up then . 
that 's true . 
i like them every now and then for a change , 
it 's nice . 
some of the stuff is good , 
but it was a tremendous amount of cooking . 
and we had little kids at the time , 
when i was home with them , and it was just so much cooking , 
i do n't like to cook . 
and i 'm not really that great at it 
so it just turned out to be too much cooking . 
so i guess i 'll let you get back to feeding your little one there . 
he 's all done . 
he 's set , 
i set him down . 
or do you get into that , 
we used to do that , 
and that would be it . 
then be gone . 
i know , 
and i can do a pretty good pie , 
we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother 
and my mother taught me how to make it . 
i can make a pretty mean pie , 
but i do n't do it anymore because it 's just too fattening . 
we had the same kind of problem . 
it 's supposed to save you money 
but you eat three times the amount of bread that you usually eat . 
it tastes so good . 
you ever seen the starter bread , 
i ca n't remember what it 's called , 
you just leave it out , 
i 've heard of it , 
but i 've never done it . 
. 
that sounds pretty good . 
but it 's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad 
and then you add all these other ingredients to it , 
and then you make the bread 
but you pinch off a portion , or save a portion of it for the next time , or something . 
you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else 
and that 's how they continue the thing . 
i do n't know how safe that was . 
i know it sounded strange to me too , 
that 's true , 
that 's got to kill anything i guess , 
i 'll talk to you later . 
where are you calling from by the way , 
where ? 
it sounds so close . 
i know we 've got a good connection , 
that 's where practically everybody i talked to is from . 
i think that 's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state . 
they 're trying to get all different amount of people . 
that 's where we went . 
you did , 
but i grew up right here in falls church , right outside d c . 
we 'd like to get back over to the east coast , 
i 'll tell you . 
it 's nice over there . 
it 's sort of funny , 
things are doing pretty good down here , 
you could n't get a job to save yourself over there 
so we decided we 'll try in a couple of years , 
we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there 
cash . 
you probably could , 
you probably could , 
it 's good talking to you . 
nice talking to you too . 
take care . 
what do you think about it ? 
the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so . 
i think a lot of it has to do with women working . 
i do too . 
in the future , i think all women are going to work . 
they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby , 
but that will be it , 
or either they 'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you just continue right on with your work . 
it really is coming to that because most women now days can not afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them . 
they ca n't even afford to take off to have children it seems like . 
and it seems , if you 're going to have kids that society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it . 
because if you have two if you go to work , you 're , just working to pay for day care , 
two or three . 
i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when i had them and when they were small , until my youngest got in junior high , i did n't have to work . 
that is good . 
i did n't work , 
but i did n't . 
she just had her fourth one in march 
and she does n't have to work either . 
i do n't know how they do it . 
i do n't know how people do it with one , 
obviously we do n't have any 
and i think that 's part of the role reversal , is it 's okay to get married and not have kids . 
and i think society for such a long time said , you 're married , 
now you need to have your family 
and i do n't think it 's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family . 
it 's getting where if you 're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you ca n't hardly afford to have over two . 
and it 's hard with two , 
i have two , 
i have a son and a daughter , 
and if i had a third one , i just do n't know where it would come from . 
because i work now , 
i work full time 
when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got . 
that helps out , 
but still , it cost a lot . 
just the cost of living 
and loans do n't pay for groceries and stuff . 
and cars and all their books , 
and the books are outrageous absolutely outrageous , 
i know , 
i know . 
and they 're getting worse . 
my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for one of her next classes 
i said is it , lined in gold . 
but it 's getting worse , 
and , if i 'd of probably had three or four children , i do n't see how we could have made it without me working . 
i guess it 's always not being able to picture one more , 
but in essence you probably would have worked out fine . 
but i think i would have had to work . 
even though he brings in a real good living and everything , in order for me to keep up , i would have had to work . 
but i think it 's getting more and more like , when you have one child that 's it , 
then you go to work 
and you work , 
because if you have two or three kids , by the , way the inflation 's going i think a woman 's always going to have to work 
and it 's just going to be an accepted thing . 
there is n't going to be any of this , 
very few people will ever stay home . 
and that 's all right with me , because i do n't want to stay home 
i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long . 
i ca n't imagine how i did , because now i work all the time , 
and i work all week , 
and i ca n't imagine how i stayed home . 
i think to myself , what did i do . 
my daughter , there 's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she 's at now . 
to her everything is , you 've got to go through college , you 've got to get a job . 
and then when everything 's set up , then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with , 
but it is so far down the road , 
, that 's what you did . . 
and then you got married 
and then you had a family . 
that 's just the way it was . 
and the woman stayed home and took care of them , 
i like the way it is . 
and so it 's not so hard for people , 
you 've been married three or so years 
and you do n't have kids , 
it 's okay , 
nobody does . 
a lot of the kids here get married out of high school . 
it 's real small town , 
and they ca n't imagine why we would want to have children . 
not everybody has to have kids , 
it 's your turn . 
whenever i was coming up and everything 
and we got married right out of high school , 
a year after i got out of high school , 
and i did n't have kids for four and a half years 
but that was because i wanted to work 
and i was n't ready for kids . 
i think that 's what it is , 
i 'm not either . 
and , everybody thought , what is the matter with her . 
they 're probably going , i bet she ca n't get pregnant 
they thought that it was terrible , 
but that you better just get ready now . 
you do n't just get ready . 
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time , they had kids within a year . 
and i just was not ready for kids . 
i wanted to get out and work a little bit 
and i wanted to travel and stuff like that , which we did . 
and kids did n't fit in right then , 
but , it 's getting more and more like that where there 's more and more couples 
i do n't care what anybody tells you . 
and i think that more and more the attitude 's getting that a way . 
because that 's like my daughter 
she says that maybe when she 's thirty she might want a child then . 
and even though i 'd like to have grandchildren , i can see her point . 
she finally told me it 's okay if you do n't , 
but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she 's from a very , very old fashioned family . 
and , she stayed home and raised her kids 
and , i was raised totally opposite . 
how we got together , i do n't know , 
because my mother had six girls , 
and she worked too . 
and i saw how life was when she stayed home 
and it was rough , 
it was hard , 
and it really is , 
i know , 
just like now there 's so much more now . 
all my income goes for things like luxuries , 
it really does . accept for what we give to my daughter , to put her through college and stuff . 
but the rest of it we just buy things like boats , 
or we go on trips , 
or just the more or less like entertainment stuff , 
i think you 've earned that though . 
i feel like i have because we 're just a age now , 
i 'm not old 
but , i 'm older . 
and i got to stay home with my kids , which i really wanted to do , 
but now i could not go back and do it . 
i really could n't , 
i do n't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing . 
and i did stuff 
but , to me it feels like i must have done nothing . 
and i think it 's just the new way that people are thinking . 
i think so . 
i think it would be neat if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you . 
more and more of them are , 
i do n't know if it is up there where you are 
but where i am , just all the hospitals , they 're getting day care . 
are they ? 
like you said if you had four kids , or even if you had two kids , you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go . 
more and more of our hospitals , especially , over here are getting them 
and then some of the bigger companies , 
but it 's mainly the hospitals . 
i know nobody around here does , it , 
it 's too small around here . 
i 'm pretty pro gun control over all . 
i 've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control 
and i 've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it . 
i guess on a scale of one of ten i 'm probably around a two in terms of 
i do n't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort . 
and guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me . 
i hope you 're ready for this . 
i 'll give it a try . 
i was raised around guns , hunting . 
so i do n't have a fear of fire arms in any respect . 
i respect them and what their capabilities are . 
it 's pretty is n't it ? 
and here you go , 
that applies to anything as well as guns . 
any of the big cities you 've got the different rival gangs 
and they 're going to fight with them . 
if they want it they 'll get it . 
they 'll get it 
and they 'll get across the border . 
since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony , if i wanted to buy one , i do n't think there should be that big of a restriction on it . 
if they want to run a background check on me . 
if they want to put a seven day waiting period again . 
you do n't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way , i would hope . 
is this guy a convicted felon ? 
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems . 
just proving that you 're basically a good citizen . 
you just told me that you 're going to get one of those guns anyway . 
because it does n't matter how restrictive your border control points are 
they 'll get it across the border one way or the other . 
so why have any restrictions at all ? 
go back to that one to ten scale where one , being , full gun control , ten being none . 
i 'd said about an eight . 
but whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able . you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon , how to safely handle the weapon , how to properly maintain it , the three basics . 
that makes a lot of since to me . 
i certainly feel that we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm 
but i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that . 
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon , as a pistol . 
i have a bicycle 
and that scares me too to tell you the truth because i 've been run off the road and all sorts of things . 
i 'm still puzzled though , 
what is the argument , 
how does the argument work if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway . 
basically , the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway 
they 're not going to take those courses . 
is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns ? 
if it 's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must 
does that mean advantage ? 
not necessarily a price thing . 
l a area ? 
bay area . 
you 've been to the city ? 
and all these people come around , 
i 'm out with my family 
we 've gone shopping , 
we 're fixing to get in the car , 
this guy comes up , 
i can pull a gun on him now . 
and when you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick . 
what if you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon ? 
then it 's still equally matched . 
having spent time in combat i feel it before they 'll get the gun on me . 
if i walk into a bad neighborhood i 'm sure i 'd want to walk through with you because i 'm sure you have far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything . 
in this sort of wild west scenario , you 're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature . 
it 's more of a police action in itself , 
and if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public , then this individual also knows this guy 's pretty good with it . 
whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not , that 's another trip , 
in defense of myself , defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat . even more so when it comes to my wife and son . 
anybody tries to hurt them i wo n't even blink , 
i know , 
i understand that . 
what if you think someone 's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake ? 
this is where the question of gun control comes in . 
that was the topic . 
what , i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot . 
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up 
i go ahead and pull my piece . 
and i make sure this persons sees it so that he 's got now doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then . 
and the only reason i feel comfortable doing that is because of the training i 've had . 
if i 'm the one doing the shooting i do n't miss . 
that 's the kind of training i 've had . 
i do n't know what you think about the , subject , 
, i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the sentencing to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that . 
i 've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while i was waiting for them to phone somebody , 
and i do n't know that that 's not a good idea . 
that 's not a bad idea 
they probably , need to change it somehow , 
the whole system needs changing , 
we 've just got too many people in there , and are putting too many people in jail that probably do n't need to be there 
i agree . 
and it 's another form of sentencing . 
but on that one thing , i still think it should be a unanimous decision , 
i agree . 
i think we 're getting to the point now where they 're going to eventually let it be majority vote . 
and that 's not going to be good . 
i do n't like that , 
i do n't like that at all . 
but it was a drug conviction 
and i do n't remember 
he had some cocaine and was accused of selling it , 
and i do n't remember exactly how much he had 
but actually not selling it , 
there 's a difference , 
and , he was a courier . 
and he sat on that jury 
and they found him guilty , 
and they went through the sentencing phase and everything 
and they were told during the trial that this is this guy 's first offense 
and he 's got this clean record , 
the jury decided , it 's time to crackdown here , 
and it was time to do this drug thing 
and let 's crackdown 
and after it was all over they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers 
however , they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal . 
so , the jury did n't know about it , 
so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy 's first offense , 
but it 's just , horrible , since it was first offense 
and he 'd been convicted three times before , 
and the jury was very upset 
and my husband came home , very upset , 
i wonder if a judge did n't have control of that if some of that would change . 
the judge might know 
or at least it would n't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better , 
if it did n't we can come back for something else 
that 's true . 
that 's very true . 
we definitely need a change in the system 
obviously what we are doing is not working . 
it 's not working , too . 
it 's just piling up on us . 
and there 's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way , shape , or form , 
and either they 're in there , forever 
or when they get out it 's a matter of a few months 
and they 're going to be right back for the same thing 
we 're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes , 
that 's very true . 
i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day 
and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive 
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves , 
i know people say it would be cruel to pull our aid from these other countries 
and maybe so , 
so tell them , you 've got five years . to work out a plan , to make it on your own . 
and , we will continue funding you for the next two years , 
by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help . 
and then we will have the money if we would do that to work on your own system because we 've got some serious problems here 
and we 're trying to , heal the world , 
very serious . 
it 's just not working . 
you 're right . 
and i feel sorry for them 
and i know they 're suffering 
and i know they 're dying everyday , 
but we 've got kids here in the united states that are dying everyday , too and being , abused and neglected 
and i do n't know . 
i just have this problem with trying to heal the world when you 're so sick yourself , 
you bet . 
we seem to agree on the jury thing 
but , we 'll need an unanimous verdict 
and , maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make , a decision . 
i think we should try it , like you say , 
if it does n't work , we can always come back , 
but i think it would be a good idea to try it . 
i do too . 
so , anyway we all agree . 
good . 
good to hear from you . 
you too . 
do you have any pets ? 
we got two cats . 
two cats . 
my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies , 
so i 'm used to having cats around , 
i like them . 
i like having pets around in general 
i favor dogs over cats actually 
i 'm not a dog person at all . 
i 'm a dog person . 
i guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid ? . 
probably , 
i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid , in fact , 
i may still be , 
but not cats . 
i wonder sometimes . 
but we house sat for my wife 's boss a couple weeks ago 
and he has a dog and everything , 
we were sitting the dog and everything 
and i felt just miserable all weekend 
it was maybe you 're still allergic to the dog . 
it was that could be it . 
you got to take them for walks 
and you 've got to pay a lot , 
you need to pay attention to cats and everything 
but it 's not quite the same thing . 
that 's true . 
and it 's just nice that cats , you do n't have to let them outside , 
all cats are indoor cats , 
limited . 
it 's a pain to clean 
when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time , 
it was really terrible . 
but now you get these liners , that is garbage bags , 
that sounds so easy , 
what i did , 
the cats do it in there , 
you pull it and take it out and throw it away , 
and that 's it , . 
and what we used to do was just put newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter 
and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing . 
same idea . 
then i would do it everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very , very rarely , 
everyday ? 
and so it was n't so bad . 
i see . 
two cats and just as easy 
it just never started smelling , 
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted . 
she 's got one dog now and the two cats 
and her dog there is basically a reject , 
somebody had bought him , and wanted him . 
and just was not mature enough to keep the dog , did n't realize how much work it was 
and she 's stuck with it . 
but i think that for me my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat . 
because that 's all there is to it . 
so , you know , 
so , you do n't have anything right now ? 
we do n't have anything right now . 
except the kid , 
now we have a kid 
but he was completely against having a dog or cat , 
he said , they 're as much work as a kid , 
and they 're harder to get rid of for the weekend , . 
we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out , 
and it 's not a big deal really , 
they 're happier when we 're around 
but they 're pretty much okay by themselves , 
and we could n't do that with a dog . 
that 's really true . 
but other friends of mine have cats , 
they have four of them , 
and if they go away , they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that 
and their cats they 're so used to the attention , that if they do n't get it , they get really upset , 
and they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that . 
and i killed that one within a very short amount of time . 
but they 're not that much fun , 
you ca n't take them for a walk , 
you ca n't , 
they ca n't fetch , 
they ca n't do anything , 
i think we had fish when i was a kid 
my brother had fish when i was a kid 
i remember that , 
i 'll never forget that 
because i remember my brother , he came home 
and he counted the fish 
and one of the fish was missing 
they could n't figure out what had happened 
it was not gross , 
i did n't see it 
trying to remember 
we had a dog for a while , 
and i do n't know if we got rid of the dog 
because my brother was allergic to it , 
my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he 's outgrown now , 
but because of that we did n't have very many pets afterwards 
and then he had fish . 
like you say , they 're not the most exciting pet to have . 
i do n't know , 
they 're pretty and everything 
but i 've just never seen the attraction of having fish . 
it 's not as much fun . 
a friend of mine had an eel , 
an eel ? 
i forget what type of fish it was , 
it was one of these fish that it ate a big other fish and things like that . 
now we really get sick . 
i could n't see having fish like that . 
i could see having , maybe some of the tropical fish , that are really , really pretty 
these are n't cats , , 
this is gross . 
what did they do , 
everyone come around and watch them . 
a cat will do the same trick . 
let 's see , 
i had a pet rat , , for a while , 
and it was a live rat , 
and this woman just offered it to me while i was in graduate school 
and , she was actually a very fun pet . 
i had a friend in college who had a pet rat for a while . 
i forget how she got it , 
but it was the same kind of a deal 
how did this work , 
a mill rat had been bought 
and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said this rat is acting really strange 
i think he 's sick , 
and she said , i do n't think he 's sick , 
i think she 's pregnant , . 
and so she asked me if i want one of those babies , 
and i took the baby 
and i got her when she was just this tiniest little thing like , half the price of a mouse , 
i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand 
and then she grew to be pretty big a pound or something 
i do n't know how much , 
and i had her for over two years 
and she was very affectionate . 
she would crawl on me 
and she would sit on my neck or my shoulder while i was working , and things like that . much more than you would think . 
if you get them young and everything before they go , kind of nuts , 
rats are not my favorite animals in the world , 
but i could see getting one from birth and everything . 
sort of weird for me to have had one too 
it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage 
and it was easy to take care of 
and they tell me the same thing . 
again it gets into much fun , what , i guess they can be . 
actually it was more fun than you would think . starting from the beginning 
it 's not fair to a pet to have a pet here , or certainly not a dog , 
people do , 
you see all these stately people , and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them , 
it 's really kind of funny . 
i was living in northern jersey when that law came through , remember hearing all about it , 
we were wondering if they had any special law for the horses in central park . 
they do n't . 
of course , not . 
they have the bags behind them 
but i think they 're actually supposed to keep them clean 
hit the bags . 
just the smell is so bad , of the horses . 
i have n't been up there , 
last time i was there was fall so probably was n't that bad . 
it 's not that long ago . 
it was twelve times , of the year . 
not this past fall 
i think was the last time i was up there and at center park . 
and i used to go up and visit her . 
that 's not too far from were we live , 
you said you had two cats , 
, are they breed cats or anything 
they 're just mutts , 
and this was before we even met . 
she 's had them for a couple years . 
and they 're really cute , 
they 're sisters , 
one of them is a lot bigger than the other one 
and , , she pushes the other one away from the food . 
apparently i do n't know all the details 
they 're both females ? 
let 's see , 
i guess it 's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing . 
i enjoy playing basketball and basically all kinds of sports . 
excuse me . 
not really 
i 'm really not too creative 
i leave that more up to my mom . 
i think it will become resume writing . 
let 's hope that you are n't employed by that craft for too long . 
i hate to think about it 
and i 'm getting rather good at reading want ads . 
what kind of time frame is it looking for the different shifts up there ? 
who knows . 
i 'm sure the number 's somewhere classified 
and twenty percent would be one thirty . 
how about that . 
that 's possible . 
how about that . 
that 's unfortunate 
are you in the defense ? 
is it many other corporations in the area ? 
i hear they 're hiring all over the place for that . 
apple 's coming to town 
and that has some opportunities 
how about that . 
personally i 'd rather die a slow painful death 
you in the computer operations or in the actual manufacturing ? 
i 'm a defense worker . 
i 'm , government tool control specialist . 
are you still employed ? 
exempt or ? 
exempt . 
unfortunately for myself it was purely by my own choice . 
there was no incentive for myself to leave , 
but it was just an opportunity arose 
and decided to take it . 
so , you did n't even get the severance package . 
i should have taken the , option when that was there , 
but it was just , i missed it by a couple months . 
but what can one do . 
i 'm just happy still to have a job . 
are you happy with what you are doing now ? 
i am kind of happy with it , 
it 's getting better all the time , 
i knew it would be different from the very beginning , 
i was in the computer operations 
it all starts to become similar 
there 's benefits 
and there 's things that were n't as good , 
but as an overall package , i 'd say i 'm pretty happy so far with the way it 's turned out . 
it has n't been a long time 
or i 'm significantly shaken by the situation , but not devastated . 
the one thing at least in your favor is the fact that , that is more in the support of the manufacturing 
to tell you the truth , i 'm not really worried . 
that 's great . 
that 's good . 
and i seem rather happy about it most of the time , just to know , what might happen . 
sometimes it 's good just to have everything out on the table . 
but still in all , it feels funny . 
it may be a blessing in disguise . 
actually , the positions that they found outside of the company were much , much better than the ones that they currently had inside . 
so , despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains , i ca n't seem to get into it right now . 
i doubt i 'll be here in six months . 
would you like to be there ? 
all things being equal . 
or even somewhere better , 
that whole area is actually quite nice . 
that 's a beautiful place . 
that 's just fantastic down there . 
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want , 
pick out where you want to live , 
and then once you pick that spot out , pick out what you want to do . 
that 's the problem . 
and now i feel lost . 
it takes a bit of a shift does n't it . 
i had job offers . 
but , i never found the one that was worth it . 
the best thing about it is that you can try something 
if you do n't like it move on to something else . 
that 's the way i would have looked at the whole thing here , 
i 'll take a chance , 
five years . 
. there 's a noticeable difference there . 
momentum is , uh , driving force in our lives . 
i 'm looking . 
that 's good , 
you 've got a good attitude about it . 
and i 'm looking at it as a change . 
and i 'm looking at it as an adventure . 
there you go . 
that 's the way to do it . 
there you go , 
that 's the thing to do . 
, how about we end this ? 
that will work out just fine . 
nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
so this is an appropriate topic the day after earth day , 
what do you think is the main pollutants in the air ? 
i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that 
i think they put off so much 
and they 're not regulated enough . 
that 's me too . 
and i 'm not sure about yesterday , 
we did n't really watch it too much yesterday , 
but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and how we 're affecting the earth and things by what we do 
and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot , 
and that actually as our population increases and our number of cars increase per the population , that 's the problem . 
but also like you said the industry pollution 
and their regulation that 's placed on them it 's better than it used to be 
but it 's incredible that they 're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air . 
i ca n't stand that 
it 's incredible . 
and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they shut down everything and they clean up their act , but on a normal basis that they 're dumping things , that they 're not supposed to be dumping , 
and i 'm if they 're getting away with it , can you imagine , 
i ca n't imagine plants , 
and then they also do testing there , 
but toxic can be anything that 's classified that can damage the earth . 
in packaging 
and just . 
i do n't think they do the packaging at this plant , 
but they do a lot of research 
and they do a lot of the refining up there 
the east side does . 
we 've got imperial sugar 
and they 've been there for years . 
you think about it , , 
i 'm not really sure 
but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down stream , 
or you can do testing on the ground itself at that point , 
but when they pollute into the air and you 've got movement through the air , it 's going to move a lot of that off . 
i know that , 
i worry every now and then , 
we 're still on a well water , 
we 're not on city water , 
i 'm not sure , 
i ca n't remember the name of the county 
i 'm not sure , 
i know it , 
i know we have a piece property there , 
so , they have a lot of cattle in the area , 
they 've got to have them there to be able to milk them . 
what it 's doing is it 's going through , 
their natural water , 
but it 's below the surface 
it 's not very far down , 
and they 're afraid that within a certain amount of years , that their water in that town will be totally polluted , 
it will . 
and they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area . 
these are well fed . 
these are well fed cows , , 
they are evidently . 
but they 're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it 's not a problem , 
but when they get them in these tiny little areas they 've got a real big problem , 
but the ponds because they 've had so much rain in the past few years , they just , overflow 
that 's bad . 
and i 'm just , 
but i do n't know 
if we keep putting that stuff into the air and if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it it 's really going to be a problem for the earth , what the earth is receiving back because how can you tell where it 's going to come down at . 
the rain forest and all . 
not me 
but it 's been suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here , 
i 'm no , 
and it will just take that longer to grow back , 
they do because carbon dioxide , they use that where we ca n't synthesize it 
believe me it 's just so much better . 
so 
i knew , 
i think there 's lots that could be done to improve how things are done now . 
i do n't know personally , 
nowadays they have the emission controls on them 
seems like they 've only just really started as far as the environment saying , we 're really going to get involved 
it 's really becoming a problem . 
what are we going to have , 
what kind of results are we going to have for the environment . 
this is really ironic that i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away . 
and it 's just been tearing me up all day . 
i bet . 
because we have just been looking all over for him . 
we 've been to the pound , 
we 've been to the adoption center , 
we 've just been all over the neighborhood , 
we 've been calling neighbors . 
so this is just really strange . 
i guess so . 
have you lost him before ? 
this is the first time . 
he 's gotten out before , 
but he 's always stayed right here , 
he 's never gone away . 
what kind of a dog is he ? 
i always forget . 
and 
he 's a big one . 
he 's pretty big . 
that 's why it really surprises me that he has n't come back , because , like i said , he 's never gone away like this before , 
and , i would think he could get hurt by a car or something . 
i do n't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big . 
but , i do n't know . 
i hope he comes back , 
that 's too bad . 
i do , too . 
how long have you had him ? 
about two years . 
that 's tough . 
you get very attached to animals , do n't you ? 
is n't that funny how we do ? 
they 're always there for you 
and they do n't talk back to you . 
and it 's kind of pleasant . 
they 're companions , 
do you have any ? 
and we have a cat , a white cat . 
how do they get along together ? 
pretty good . 
we had the dog first , 
and she 's kind of a wimp 
and the cat kind of rules , 
but she likes him all right . 
we had another cat about two years ago . 
so we had to have it put to sleep , 
and then we got this new cat , 
so . i have two children 
and they really enjoy the animals . 
and then my mother who 's very elderly lives with us , 
and she 's really good friends with the dog . 
they 're very , good buddies . 
that 's what are so neat about animals , 
like i said , they 're really companions , 
and they 're friends . 
that 's right . 
you can love them all you want 
and they love you right back 
that 's right . 
they do n't care what you look like , or what you act like , 
they just love you , unconditionally . 
i know . 
it 's wonderful . 
it 's just so neat , 
i do n't know , 
this is just so hard . 
i know it has to be . 
it 's like i said , 
we 've had him for two years 
he 's gotten out , 
but he 's always been right there . 
he 's never been gone at all 
he 's just always been right there when he gets out . 
it 's the first time he 's ever been gone like this . 
that 's really too bad , 
that 's awful , 
i just knew today that we looked at the pound , and that we just went all over the place , 
and i knew we were going to find him , 
and when we did n't it was , . 
so i do n't know . 
i hope you 'll find him . 
you most likely will . 
not yet . 
have you put any posters up or anything like that ? 
we were talking about that tonight since he just got out yesterday 
we were trying to find some pictures of him recently . 
but we just do n't have a whole lot . 
we have him on film on the video camera . 
you sure ca n't . 
so , i do n't know , 
we will put some posters and stuff up . 
that 's good . 
and hopefully that will help maybe around the neighborhood . 
but , we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood , 
they can keep their eyes open , 
that will help . 
i think that if he gets out he 'll come back . 
i really do , because he knows exactly where he lives , 
he will . 
i bet he does . 
i know , that it 's hard on you . 
i know that i 'd be worried , too . 
i know . 
it 's just so ironic that this would happen and i would get this kind of a call . 
is n't it , though ? 
i know , 
it 's very strange 
i know sometimes our cat will stay out all night , 
and when he 's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something 's happened to him , that he 's got in a fight or somebody 's hit him 
but he 's always come back eventually 
that 's good . 
that 's one thing about cats though , 
they 're so small 
and they can get hurt a lot easier . 
they can get hurt a lot easier , 
they can . 
so that would make you really , tend to worry about them if they 're not right there 
but he 's a real feisty guy . 
he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he does n't want them on our property . 
is that right ? 
they just really do not want other animals on their property . 
any cat that comes near , and even a dog he wo n't jump at them or anything , 
but he 'll sit 
and he 'll watch , 
and , i think maybe he would if it came real close , 
but he 's very protective of our property . 
i guess i really do n't know cats that well because my mother never liked them , 
so i never had them growing up , 
so i never really had them around me , 
they 're really a lot different than dogs because they 're very independent , 
and he 's very affectionate when he wants to be , 
but if you want him to be and he does n't want to be , he 'll either scratch you or run away . 
but when he wants to be he 's really affectionate . 
but if he 's not in the mood , you 'd better stay away from him . 
but , dogs seem to be always in the mood . 
that 's true . 
i like the way they come up 
and they 'll put their head underneath your hand . 
and most dogs do that . 
they do . 
i do n't know any that really do n't . 
they know exactly how to get that attention , 
they sure do . 
they just come up , 
or they 'll rub their head against you . 
he 's outside during the day 
and then we get home at night we do bring him in . 
the backyard , it 's really big , too , for him to run in and stuff . 
that 's why we could n't understand why he would want to get out because he 's had all this room to run in , 
how did he get out ? 
he dug a hole under the fence . 
he did it a couple weeks ago , dug a hole , 
and we filled it back up put him back in there . 
he did it again 
so we chained him up 
but we really did n't want to keep him chained up because we feel like that 's just too restricting for him . 
so we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it so that he could n't get out . 
he kind of ripped through the chicken wire . 
i do n't understand because it 's , like , he 's got a good home , 
we have two kids that just love him a lot , 
it 's like we ca n't understand why he kept wanting to get out , 
we just could n't , 
you know , that , animals are like that . 
they like to roam and investigate . and see what 's going on . 
i guess that 's probably true . 
i do n't think it 's anything we did . 
least i hope not . 
i know , 
he really does have a good home . 
how are your kids handling it ? 
i do n't know if it 's quite hit them . 
i have two girls , 
i do n't know , 
at first they seemed to be upset , 
but now it 's if he does n't come home , can we get another dog . 
that sounds like kids . 
it 's , wait a minute , . 
poor buddy . 
i said , he 's only been gone a day 
and you already want to replace him . 
what 's his name , 
buddy . 
buddy ? 
that was our cat 's name that died . 
is that right ? 
but , buddy after buddy bell , 
that 's funny . 
but , he was a good cat , too . 
we miss him a lot , 
and i just felt so bad , 
it 's real contagious 
and the vet said it runs rampant in this area , 
i did n't know that . 
they get it if the other cat has it 
i had no idea . 
i did not know that . 
i just felt terrible . 
i could never justify owning a personal computer at home , 
that 's quite an expense to look for , 
who is this , 
that 's actually a good question . 
my wife works out of our home . 
she has an office 
and in fact she sits in the office 
now . 
so that 's a very regular use of it that she has . 
i 'm a computer scientist . 
and so i write programs to do little things 
i 'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things 
nothing special . 
so i learned to repair one 
but i never really learned to operate one . 
that 's a key thing . 
there 's really two issues to that that there 's so many software packages available today . that just require no programming . 
in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming 
but if they were careful , they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works . 
but i think you really hit the nail on the head . 
for the average person is exactly what he can use it for . 
whatever 
your issue is then there really , 
space is a handicap with me , 
i live in a motor home . 
i see 
and i 'm preparing for retirement . 
i see 
and i 'm not to far from it 
another year and a half . 
actually one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap . 
but just like the computers . 
remember how they started out running three , four hundred dollars . 
the calculators you mean . 
calculators , 
they sure do . 
i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum . 
you can actually buy a whole brand new computer not a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars . 
including a printer ? 
actually i was n't including a printer , 
but you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars 
so make it seven hundred . 
a hundred ? 
a respectable one ? 
i do n't keep track of prices on them , 
but that does amaze me . 
the prices had plummeted , 
the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred 
that 's the deal is you 're not buying brands now , 
probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there 's a magazine called computer shopper . 
it 's a big magazine , 
and it 's probably an inch thick a thousand pages . 
but the magazine is full of these computer mail-order houses 
and they 're all competing with each . 
and you mix and match 
and then you do it by mail-order . 
but there 's no real brands 
it 's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards , the main computer , the circuit board . 
i see . 
how do you go about getting one of those catalogs ? 
you 'll notice that although it 's a magazine it 's large . 
and like i said it 's about an inch thick . 
i 'll tell you , 
first of all i do n't like a machine that 's smarter than me . 
they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten . 
that 's right . 
there 's great . 
anyway that 's one ever my favorite jokes . 
one and one equals ten . 
that 's great . 
course it 's kind of an inside joke . 
i understand , 
that 's great , 
that 's a good joke . 
i did for years 
and then i was a scientist over in central research labs 
and just recently i 've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing . 
now i type that one , 
but i do n't use it anymore . 
i just recently started using one . in connection with my work . 
i keep track of an inventory here . 
and of course that is where a computer is very handy . 
i agree . 
and it 's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated . 
i see 
that 's fascinating . 
so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated , 
and they 're dated . 
so i have to keep up with them , 
and it 's very handy doing it on the computer . 
it is handy . 
and i must admit that up until i did start using one i had very little interest in computers . 
but they are amazing . 
they certainly are . 
so let 's see 
i guess we 've kind of covered it . 
i think we did . 
nice little conversation with you jack . 
good day . 
good luck to you . 
thank you . 
same to you . 
i do n't know how much i know about this subject . 
i do n't know if i know anything or not , 
but i 've got some opinions on it . 
go ahead . 
those type of people that have the most opinions , ones that do n't know anything . 
i 've had teenagers 
and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers , 
and i do n't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective . 
i think this `` me '' generation has gone far too far . 
and the young people are overly impressed . 
and i think it would n't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint . 
that 's true . 
i personally know nothing about the peace corps though . 
me either . 
i went to college and then started working and then got married 
and i 'm out on a limb here , 
some type of college volunteer work for teachers , that they are straight out of college 
have you ever heard about that one ? 
i have n't , 
i have a twin sister 
and i know , that if you have college notes , if you teach in a lower income bracket where they do n't pay as much they cancel part of your college note or whatever . 
if it 's really a lower paying job where in a small town you do n't need as much as far as to live . 
and this is money that she 's borrowed to form her college education ? 
she only taught there one year 
but she got credits for it ? 
that 's very interesting . 
some group paid part of his college income 
it 's a nursing home or something like that . 
i think that 's a good way for people to maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want . 
i think that is an excellent program , 
i really do . 
i like that . 
as far as getting doctors and all that stuff , 
if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist , we could find one 
it would n't be convenient , 
but we could find one . 
so , i can see the advantage to that one . 
the peace corps itself is really dying out , is n't it ? 
i really do n't know that much about it , 
it 's still in existence . 
and do n't they go into other countries and stuff ? 
i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm dig their own wells , set up , their schools . 
and 
you 're right , 
i think it 's a sixties program . 
that was his big deal . 
but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it 's like if you do n't have all the money and ca n't have what you want when you want it . 
, i think i 've singled out my grandchildren 
but actually they 're pretty good , along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people 's children and grandchildren , 
mine are n't really that bad , 
but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good . 
i do n't know that you could require everyone to do it for a whole year , or two years or something like that , 
mandatory just like the draft . 
they could buy their way out . 
there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else . 
they 'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat . 
but , , i 'm wondering if there 's another issue here , 
and maybe this is why this has died out . 
and this was n't the question 
can they go in there 
and it does n't do any good . 
i do n't know that it does . 
we 're losing certain , races of people . 
but i never can remember what it was , 
sad little things . i felt sorry for them . because their society is n't there anymore , 
and their belief system and all the structures of their society are gone , essentially . 
and they 're just kind of more like a side show than anything else 
and that 's sad . 
but i do n't think there 's any way the peace corps could go in and rescue those people , 
so , i 'm wondering if the peace corps is , really an effective tool . 
good point . 
we 've got enough without a passport 
there 's plenty . 
i think we ought to worry about our own species . 
and maybe rather than just , require somebody to join the peace corps for a year maybe during college maybe have some kind of course where they 'd be required to do some kind of community service type work , and help people in that area or people in the united states . 
and i 've been out of school too long to answer this , 
but i wonder if there are n't some sociology courses . 
there probably are , 
people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff 
but i think that it would n't really be half bad for everybody not to do something and realize it 's everybody 's responsibility to help these people , 
i 'm not saying just give them money 
that 's the last thing you want , to do . 
i know that 's what my father-in-law was talking about , 
when you give these people money 
or , , what was it 
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give more money to these people , 
and that 's not really the answer because if they 're alcoholics they 'll just go out and spend , it on booze or something like that , 
that 's exactly it . 
they 're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it . 
come on , let 's be realistic , 
that 's just not realistic . 
or to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves , 
i guess we 're getting kind of off the subject , , here , 
we 're not . 
i think , that 's more realistic than making them go in the peace corps . 
i think that 's a lot more realistic . 
i think that we should be spending more time 
we 've got plenty , 
in fact , we 've got far too many . 
you 're in flower mound ? 
flower mound , 
that 's exactly what i was going to ask you . 
i guess i 've had to return something 
but i ca n't decide , 
mostly it 's been because i did n't like the color , 
or i 'm not sure whether i 've had to return that many things , 
i 'm having a problem right now with a computer that we 've just returned . 
are you ? 
for me it 's actually a pretty good topic . 
so , we 'll talk about that some . 
we could talk about that , 
and then we could talk a bit about just quality of products in general , if they 're better or worse if they last longer or something like that . 
let me tell you just a little bit about myself . 
but for the last four or five years i 've had eye problem , 
and i 've had two cornea transplants . 
shopping is no fun anymore . 
i can imagine . 
i ca n't see good enough , 
and it 's hard to tell what i 'm doing , 
you ca n't read labels 
i just thought of something we have to return . 
there you go . 
it 'll come to us , 
are you ready ? 
i think that sounds fascinating . 
we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project , 
and we called up the company and asked them details on it . 
we bought not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper . 
and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with , 
and they were very happy with the system , 
and they felt they 've gotten a good price . 
and we went in , 
we explained what we needed 
and 
and so we went there , 
we told them about the stuff 
and the guy said that the computer would fit our needs . 
these things wo n't make any sense to you probably 
but he told us we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer . 
and it 's called a user boards 
or slots is what it 's called . 
and we can put full size cards in there . 
and so we said , great , 
we 'll buy it , 
and we put in our order . 
and a week later we went back and picked up the computer . 
and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it 
and there 's only one slot we could put it in . 
and at this point we only have one board 
so it was n't so bad 
so we used it a bit , 
but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in . 
the computer was supposed to have two . 
it has them 
but the problem is that you ca n't put the type of card that we need to put in it , in it . even though they told us in advance that you could , 
i see . 
they told us there would be no problem because the salesman just does n't really know . 
i see . 
in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it . 
they probably did n't know what they were talking about . 
that 's completely it . 
the salesman did n't know . 
so , we went back in , 
so they did that . 
and we said are you sure this will work , 
and they were doing it at their own costs . 
and so we said , . 
and we went back 
and then we get the computer home , 
my husband goes to pick it up last week 
and we could n't go get it sooner because i just had the baby , 
and life 's just a little bit complicated . 
and he goes and gets it , brings it home , 
first of all they 're missing components of it like cables 
so you ca n't really test it out . 
and then second thing , we still ca n't put the boards in , because they have other things blocking where we need to do it . 
and now we 're dealing with having to bring it back again 
and we hope so , 
it really is . 
you know , it 's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on . 
and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction . 
i think that 's the worst part . 
so actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card 
and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation , 
and they said , you do n't have to pay for it yet . 
that 's an advantage , is n't it ? 
it really is . 
i think there 's a lot not to be said for credit 
but that 's one thing to be said for credit . how , it gets you some muscle where you need it . 
and i think that 's really important . 
because these guys if they give us a hard time we 're going to say , you , look , 
if you ca n't fix this to our satisfaction , we 're just returning the computer . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
and if we do that , i just tell the credit card company , do n't pay the charge , even though they 've already paid it . 
that 's right . 
but they 'll just undo the credit that they did to them . 
they will , 
that 's right . 
they will , 
they will put the kind of clout on them that you ca n't really do . 
and so she does n't remember anything 
but to keep her entertained , music and some of these things do help . 
the first time i turned it on i was recording , 
and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the , thing . 
so after that then , you could n't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side . 
and she says it 's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far , 
and so you ca n't get it to run the right way , either , 
what brand is it ? 
do you know ? 
so i wish i could tell you 
i really do n't know which brand it is . 
but i was wondering 
in our case where we knew we were buying a copy 
i think this is maybe a name brand 
and i suspect that it 's probably , just a fluke . 
i have the papers and everything 
and we 're going to just take it back 
do you buy it at some major store ? 
chain down there that i do n't know up here . 
do n't they ? 
this was a regular electronics store . 
so , i do n't think there will be too much problem 
but i guess i 'm not sure whether i think things are not made as well . 
i think a lot of things are not made as well . 
do n't you ? 
of course , it 's hard to think of an exact example , 
that 's good 
i like electronic stuff 
for one thing . i know their , work , 
cars i think are not made , as well as they could be . 
i think that 's right . 
they want people to replace it after , a couple of years . 
they may cost a little more , 
but they do n't have to take them to the shop every other day . 
and i loved it . 
it did a good job , 
so , part of it is that we need to develop more of a pride in , the kinds of things we do so we make them better . 
and it kind of has to start from the top or from the bottom maybe and go clear up . 
the people just do n't care about , what they 're doing . 
nobody 's , really paying , 
attitude is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do , 
give me my paycheck , so i can go home . 
what i 'm doing . 
i think that 's too bad . 
and it 's a shame too because when you get right down to it most things , if you do a good job , nobody can pay you enough . 
there is n't , any way to get paid enough . 
but if you do a good job , you feel enough satisfaction , 
so whatever you 're paid is enough . 
i do research 
and so i 'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done . 
and you get satisfaction out of it . 
that 's right , 
but i think things come both from the individual side and also from the company side 
you 're the last one hired 
so you 'll be the first one fired , 
and we just want you to do your day 's work , 
and we do n't really care about you , as an individual . 
when you 've got that type of attitude on it , the people do n't care , about their work . 
it probably basically goes right back into the home though unfortunately . 
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay . 
little value just in whatever you do . 
that the value is in doing it well 
doing a good job of it . 
the question was about physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise . 
i do n't do it as much as i should . 
i try to walk . 
and last year i did it every day , 
and so i 'm not doing it as much as i need to , 
but i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier . 
i agree . 
but it 's just to get motivated to do it , 
and once i get started , i do it every night . 
and what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again . 
and i was walking , 
and it got kind of dark . 
and i was by myself , 
so i kind of got frightened , 
and i kind of use that as an excuse . 
all i have to do , is start earlier , 
i have n't walked since , 
it 's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise . 
i know what you mean . 
it sure is . 
it sure is . 
how about you ? 
do you exercise on a regular basis ? 
i try to . 
i started at the beginning of this year , 
i decided i 'm going to start exercising again , 
i 'm going to be real good , 
and they run for two months at a time . 
and you do have to pay to take them . 
and i signed up for one that was three nights a week , an hour and a half , 
so that was four and a half hours a week . 
and i thought , that 's not cheap , 
that 'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money . 
and i had a friend of mine going , 
so i was real good , 
i only missed it about three times . 
and then march came around , 
and i signed up again , 
and then i was having to work some real late hours to get with my work after i got out of class . 
and so that was two weeks i had missed , 
and i tell you what , 
i 've been terrible ever since then . 
it 's once you get out of that habit you do n't get back into it . 
because i teach school , 
and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class . 
we went in together and hired a private instructor , 
and she came to our school twice a week . 
i would go faithfully , 
and then i missed once . 
then i went back again a couple times and missed another time , and then kept missing and never went back again . 
i think , you just have to stick with it . 
and this session is about to run out . 
now i signed up for a different one now that 's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes 
and some of them require me to go out of town , 
and , that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that . 
lately there 's been nights that i could have gone 
but i 'm fine this week . 
i could have gone tonight , 
and i did n't . 
and now it 's kind of this is the last week . 
i 'll just start fresh next week . 
but , i better do it . 
and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months was n't the second two months . 
she started taking tennis lessons , 
and so i have n't had that extra motivation , of us encouraging each other to go . 
that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same thing . 
it 's misery loves company . 
i do n't really love exercise . 
the neighbor across the street , she belongs to president 's , 
and it 's not president 's any more . 
i do n't know what the name of it is anymore . 
but she loves it . 
it 's an automatic high for her . 
she just enjoys it so much . 
and i do n't . 
i 'm the same way . 
i feel good after i do it , 
but i hate it when i 'm doing it . 
i do n't enjoy it at all , 
and she just loves it . 
so . even when she does n't go to the health club , she runs . 
and , it 's a daily thing for her . 
and it 's so hard for me . 
i envy her , 
i wish i could be that way , 
i do too . 
and i have an older sister that loves running , too , 
and she runs all the time , 
in fact , i do n't run . 
i hate to run . 
when i walk i 'll take along a radio or something 
and that helps pass the time . 
walking is kind of boring . 
i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood , 
and we used to try to get together , 
and i think now that the weather 's getting nicer we 're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking . 
there 's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex . 
and it 's not as boring if you get several people 
that 's right . 
and you can kind of talk , 
and it makes it pass pretty quickly , 
and the aerobics is n't too boring . 
i kind of enjoy it when i 'm doing it . 
it 's a lot more fun than some other things i could do , i guess . 
but i do have to make myself go , 
and of course while i 'm doing it i feel pretty good , 
and after i get finished i feel great . 
it 's great afterwards , 
i can go in there , 
and i 'll make myself go , 
and i 'll have headache and everything , 
and i get out , 
i do n't have a headache any more . 
i feel great , 
it 's amazing how much better i feel . 
and then just in general , i sleep a lot better 
that 's right . 
and i just feel much better . 
i 've been kind of dragging the last few weeks , 
and i know if i would just get around to exercising i 'd feel better . 
it does , 
it gives you energy . 
i 'm too tired , 
or i have a headache 
i just got over the flu , 
so i better not go . 
it 's kind of a vicious circle is n't it ? 
it really is . 
i find , too , that i have more energy when i exercise , 
and it 's silly not to , 
but , i do n't know , 
it 's just a put off . 
i do n't know why i do n't do more , 
and i know that it 's good for my health . 
i know from everything that you read and you see on television now , exercise is so important to good health . 
there 's no reason that we should n't do it , 
but i do n't know . 
it 's just hard to make yourself go . 
and i think one thing i do n't like about aerobics is that after i 'm finished it 's kind of late at night , 
does it cost the same for just two nights 
it 's less expensive . 
that 's good , too . 
but i 'm glad it 's not too totally cheap , because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more , probably . 
since it 's more expensive , i think , you spent that much money , 
you 'd better go . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
do you have a facility right at where you work ? 
it 's right there , 
they 've got two different aerobics rooms , 
you do n't like to see how you work . 
and then they hire private instructors ? 
that 's great . 
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms , 
and it 's a pretty nice setup . 
and of course it 's real convenient , because it is right there at work . 
i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere , i 'd never make it . 
and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the recreation center and do it helps a lot . 
i can see that would be easy . 
they make it as easy as they possibly can for you . 
do a lot of people take advantage of it ? 
quite a few do . 
they have some during lunch hour that are shorter , 
and i guess guys can take advantage of that . 
for me , i would n't have time to do an hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get dressed again . 
but there 's a lot more guys that do that one . 
they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that . 
so they have big variety . 
they even have some water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool . 
i 've never done that one before . 
you have a pool there , too ? 
how nice . 
it is a real nice facility . 
it 's also got a full inside basketball court , 
and i think they 're working on building a jogging track and some other things . 
but it is very nice . 
that 's great . 
i just do n't take as much advantage of it as i should . 
i 'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing . 
does it cost money to exercise in the weight room or to go swimming . 
do you have to pay for that , too . 
you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities , 
and it 's about eight dollars a month . 
that 's not bad . 
not at all . 
pretty cheap . 
and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership , 
but , i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced , from what i 've heard . 
i think so too , 
and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics ? 
people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics ? 
the topic was , should the united states adopt the metric system , 
how should they do it ? 
why did n't it work last time ? 
and why did n't it work last time ? . 
i 'm all for it . 
i am too . 
and i guess , they tried soft conversion and hard conversion 
one of them is where you just take whatever 's already standard 
direct conversion . 
i do n't know . 
and people if they have to are going to learn to think that way . 
they do , 
and it has the metric equivalent written on there , 
it figures . 
that 's the problem . 
so you can figure out what you 're actually paying for it . 
i do n't know , 
when i was growing up , we were talking metric system in school . 
not at first , 
but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway . 
i would expect people with any kind of buying power under the age of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is . 
i think maybe there 's where the problem came in . 
it 's kind of like learning a language , 
when you learn one from the other , you always end up in this conversion thing all the time . 
course this country is n't a dictatorship , 
thing is , it 's a global market place these days , 
something . 
i do n't remember what the other one is 
it 's just time for us to go over . 
we 're all around the world , 
you have to perform this conversion anyway . 
i do , too . 
with any drawing system you end up with things in parts of inches , half , fourth this sort of thing . 
and then some of them are done in purely metric . 
somewhere down the line they went standardized , 
but you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs . 
i can imagine . 
have you ever lived in a country where they use metric . 
and i had to get used to purely metric system down there , because they did n't understand anything else . 
if you start talking about miles , they 'd look at you like , what . 
so , i had a little bit of experience with it , 
and you get this funny looking coke , 
it 's in a can that 's taller but not as big around . 
it 's a strange looking can . 
but she gets real confused on distances 
if it 's between zero and ten , it 's cold , 
and if it 's ten and twenty it 's not too bad , 
if it 's between twenty and thirty it 's pretty warm , 
it 's getting warm . 
but , . the big problem is not having the resolution between a hundred , or what , thirty , zero thirty four degrees , whatever that is . 
you do n't get all the little differences 
is about twice as much , what it works out to . 
five . 
one point eight times as many points . 
something like that . 
and until we have to learn to think that way , we wo n't . 
they 're on metric , are n't they ? 
for the most part , i think so . 
we run into some problems once , 
and this thing was even different than s a e standards and stuff . 
he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing . 
he just get one more . 
but the threads were different , 
and it was a total mess . 
that would be a mess . 
but it 's got the hardest combination of metric 
and , most of the body parts seem to be metric , 
and most of the engine parts seem to be s a e , 
so . it 's just crazy . 
it just gets bad , 
you got to have one , and not mix them up . 
because you 're never going to get to one system if you still got a mix . 
and of course , here that would involve changing road signs all across the country , 
miles per hour to kilometers per hour , and the whole nine yards . 
kind of hard to do gradually . 
and you know 
you 'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour . 
you 'd have people going a hundred miles an hour . 
and , so . i do n't know , 
but it 's almost eight hundred kilometers . 
that sure seems like a long way . 
i guess that 's it . 
every road sign you come to , is i do n't know it . 
they could 've converted it to metric just about as easy . 
you still got cars on the road that do n't have both . 
not all that common . 
now cars , they have both . 
sooner or later they 'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way . 
and some are in kilometers . 
and you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour , 
start . 
right now they 've got kind of a central location off of the main highway , 
and i think they 've got some kind of container for aluminum . 
they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans . which we 're supposed to put all our week 's garbage into it , 
and of course it does n't fit right now . 
but now we start in may , breaking it down , 
and they 're picking it all up . 
and we have to separate our papers , and our glass , 
and then they have one day for everything you picked up from your yard , 
and we put that in disposable bags , 
so it 's really great . 
i 'm completely for it , 
i think it 's marvelous . 
that 's good . 
and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably , because they 're going to do it . 
i do n't know how soon they 're going to do it , or how organized it 's going to be , 
but they 're supposed to initiate that sometime in the next couple of months . 
i 've never noticed that . 
we do n't have a whole lot , because we 're in a hospital setting , 
so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria . 
down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your pop cans , and things like that ? 
there 's only one pop machine 
and it 's not accessible to the cafeteria now , 
so mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea . 
so you do n't have much choice there . 
not really . 
so it 's getting people . 
and they brought it down to the shelters . 
and , they have three that i know of for cans for people have pop , 
and they put them right near where they have the time cards . 
and it works great . 
and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too . 
that 's good . 
so they 're really going at it , 
and i think they 're trying to make some changes . 
and it 's a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil . 
i saw part of that . 
it was good . 
the only thing i thought that i have n't been trying , is when i go to take a shower , to save the water , and to put it on my plants . which i had never thought about before . 
i started years ago , i guess , 
not years ago , 
but 
i would say five years ago , 
but i did n't realize that was the biggest waste of water . 
that was surprising to me . 
i missed that question , totally really bad . 
i 'm trying to think , 
i did n't miss too many , 
i ca n't remember what my score was , 
but i did exceeding well . 
i was surprised . 
that was a shocker to me . 
there are a lot of things that are n't , 
that 's one of the things i wonder about , 
one of the questions was , do you think more should be done , or something else . 
i wonder about some of the products that they do n't take , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take . why they could n't do more recycling with those . 
and , what i do n't understand is there is recycled paper in there , 
and it cost more than regular paper . 
but , it upset me to realize that they 're going through the expense of recycling , 
but people are n't buying it , 
so the cost of it is higher . 
i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing , 
but the cost is double or sometimes triple , the regular fertilizers and things you buy . 
and , for the environment there 's a good reason to do it , 
but the cost is kind of prohibitive . 
that 's recycling , 
companies that do at least go into it , i 'd like to see . 
so that people would use this stuff over again . 
it 's a good idea . 
but lots of times you do n't even see the signs on the bottles . 
and if we 're going to really do something , they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it . 
that 's hard when you 're in a grocery store and you 're short anyway . 
you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf . 
you have n't got enough nerve to say put it back , 
i 'd heard something stranger , 
and apparently they do n't break down very easily , 
and , they do n't expand or contract when the weather changes , 
and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing . 
i know , 
the old ones ? 
smashing them up , because that stuff there is great in road work . 
and i thought , that 's good . 
and then i saw recycling , 
hoses were being used , 
what else , 
something else was made out of old tires , 
i was trying to remember what it was . 
i ca n't think of it now . 
but i was trying to get my kids to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes . 
but my biggest problem is , i take the bags out of the store , buy the bags to bring the back , 
and then i forget to bring them in the store . 
i 'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out . 
i wish they 'd really push this recycling bit , because i really did n't realize how much stuff i actually throw away . 
i think the more people are aware of it , the more they 'll do . 
i think that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is , and how important it is to do that . 
you know what i 'd like to see a little more . 
i do n't have any little tiny kids , 
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now , in five years , when they get bigger , it 'll work a little bit more , too . 
we 've all got to do it right now . 
i do n't think i can keep my own garbage . 
i might not have that much , 
both . 
both , 
are you at work right now ? 
so am i . 
in which building ? 
are you summit 
this is fun . 
what building are you in ? 
i 'm building one . 
i 'm building two . 
at least we found something different . 
i 've never had a call , 
not like that . 
neither have i . 
is n't that funny ? 
i got a woman in new jersey the last time i called , i think . 
that 's funny . 
that is funny . 
so how 's the weather in building two ? 
the weather in building two is cold 
it 's been cold . 
it 's been cold in the building . 
outside the building it 's not bad . 
listen 
i got me doing it . 
i 'm a transplant . 
how long have you been here ? 
five years now . 
i 've been here pretty long . 
you know about august then . 
i 've been through five of those . 
there 's no surprises left . 
if they 're going to go out of state for vacation that 's the time to go . 
good idea . 
real good idea . 
it was beautiful . 
that 's even farther away . 
that is really nice . 
it is so cool , you wear a jacket . 
even in the summer time . 
is that right ? 
they call it their liquid gold . 
you get sunshine , 
and it 's lovely , 
green . 
it 's pretty . 
not in the spring . 
i have to think every year to try to remember what 's it supposed to . 
spring is nice . 
because march we usually get a lot of rain , in march . 
it 'll seem . 
march we typically get a lot of rain , 
and we 've had this many inches , 
and we 're right on target , 
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in march , 
we always do though . 
it 's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like . 
i just wish it would n't come all at once . 
that 's right , 
and then we get all that heat . 
and . . 
when it rains , it rains . 
you got into that bad stuff . 
it did n't break anything , 
but we went out there afterwards 
is n't that strange . 
i know , 
you pick them up , 
and they 're perfectly round . 
and i go , how did they form so perfect like that . 
i think that 's one of the strange , strange things , 
and you very seldom see it though . 
i 've seen hail , 
really small . 
but this was really large . 
so it 's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently . 
is that correct ? 
i do n't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth . 
it 's not on the ground , 
but in the clouds it is . 
must be . 
i guess , 
and then , i think all that falling would warm it up and melt it , 
but maybe that 's what rounds it . 
but , tumbling . 
i was dumb . 
and i had called back to the house . 
i stayed the weekend , 
and i called back to the house . 
i said , okay 
and i watched the news , 
i do n't have anything to worry about . 
felt so dumb . 
finally i got home and found out my property was okay . 
there was no problem with it . 
but i guess you just tend to think of where your house is and nothing else . 
i see . 
the streets and stuff around that area , get a lot of flooding . 
that 's where i live , close to that . 
not quite , 
is that a nice area ? 
it 's getting built up with more new shopping centers and things , 
it 's a fairly new area . 
a brand new mall not too far away from that area , 
the house that i bought was really , really nice . 
it 'd be nice . 
really , really nice home , very pretty . . 
but you 're not living there right now . 
i 'm going to lease it . 
i see . 
it 's investment property . 
i see . 
but it 's a very nice place . 
i would cheerfully live there . 
of course it 's not my home , 
and i 've lived in my home almost ten years , 
and i 've got everything just exactly like i want it . 
but if i were to live some place else , it certainly meets my standards . 
it 's a nice house . 
that 's a nice area . 
is it on the golf course ? 
it 's not , 
it 's off the golf course , 
and i 'll be honest with you , 
i 'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is . 
is that right . 
that 's a nice area . 
it is . 
that really is a nice area . 
when they get that highway finished , you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick . 
another belt line , just farther out . 
just continue to do that . 
or used to anyway . 
i 've been through all of that . 
they 're not really hills , 
i 'm not familiar with what , 
is it along the coast or inland . 
. it may be a little bit more inland . 
out there , 
and we went up that coastline , 
and i was just amazed how unusual that looks . 
hang on just a second , 
valley . 
valley . 
i know where that is . 
beyond thousand oaks . 
i know where valley is , 
i 've been out there before , 
you do n't think that 's strange looking . 
i did n't notice anything strange about it . 
it 's just a strange landscape , 
i do n't remember seeing that part of it . 
i know valley , 
it 's just a suburb of l a . 
and they 've built some new highways out to that area , and things , lately . 
people can get in and out of l a easier . 
maybe it 's a place i went to , 
it was far extreme , 
thought we 'd never find the place . 
sounds interesting . 
i know exactly that area . 
it 's a nice area out there . 
i love thousand oaks . 
you just have less a variety , i guess . 
i do n't think it 's quite as green . 
it 's green with all the trees and things out here 
it 's green sometime . 
i do n't know . 
it does n't stay green 
all honesty , you have n't seen the hottest of summers if you 've only been here five years . 
we have n't had a really bad one , 
jack , what type of music do you like ? 
i like classical , and sort of popular rock type music . 
i enjoy classical too . 
i never really had listened to it till i got married , 
and my wife enjoys it . 
so i had never listened to it till then , 
but now i listen to it whenever she does . 
and even every once in a while i put it on myself . 
i used to play the piano , 
those are really nice . 
i like those . 
i do n't know all that much myself , 
i just know , when i hear it that i like it . 
what you like . 
how about popular music ? 
but sometimes i have a hard time hearing the words clearly if i 'm in the car and there 's noise and stuff 
i 'm pretty much the same way . 
i know . 
i know , 
i know . 
about the only thing i can remember after the song is over is the refrain . 
whenever they say it two or three times . 
i 'm the same way . 
it 's funny depending on where you live , 
and the difference in the radio with popular music , is totally different , 
so , it was sort of a funny thing . 
there 's a big variation among the country , 
i 'm starting to realize that . 
i never really thought about that much , 
but there is . 
and i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area ? 
i really did n't notice at all . 
it just seemed the same . 
but when i went more rural it really changed . 
does it ? 
you do n't have to wait till the hour mark . 
it 's sort of constant . 
you just turn there , 
and you get the latest news and everything . 
and it 's on . 
that would really be beneficial . 
so . 
because you never hear the news basically on the radio . 
i never get it . 
and if you do n't read the paper , you sort of fall behind if you 're in , the car all the time . 
that 's pretty good . 
i like to listen to tapes of music or , stuff on a long trip . 
and now you can even get books on tape . 
on fact my grandmother does that a lot , because she 's blind , 
or she 's losing her sight or whatever . 
i can imagine if you 're driving cross country listening to a story . 
lot of the classics are really , on tape . 
so , that 's a lot of fun 
that would be good . 
i guess so . 
but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening . so as long you 're listening . 
but if you do have to go , i guess we can just cut off . 
jack , it was nice to talk to you . 
and good luck , 
and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls . 
thank you . 
what 's that , 
the i thirty and central express ? 
is that right ? 
how about that ? 
it 's a new home ? 
it 's about eight years old , 
about eight years . 
it 's a duplex type thing . very modern and very open and light . 
we live in a brick story and a half , 
what 's your house like ? 
and have a big sun room on the back of it . 
so it 's got a lot of openness and light , also ? 
it does n't ? 
it does n't have . 
that 's what my wife really wanted 
with openness and light ? 
i understand that , 
i would love that too . 
our last house was n't too bad , 
but it was just too traditional , 
this is very traditional . 
the next time probably a year and a half from now , we 're going to try to build . 
so make one really contemporary , and very modern and very open and very light . 
do you have children at home ? 
i have three in college . 
three ? 
they usually , get back at least two of them for the summer , 
you still need space , plenty of space . 
still need a little bit of space . 
we have a lot less than we had recently . 
already cut back . 
how big is your place ? 
that 's good size . 
it has one wing built on that 's a kitchen family room , and then the big room on the back . 
so now we 're down to , two and two . 
two and two , 
so it wo n't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home , 
but it wo n't be that long , because we . 
repossessed . 
and if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal . 
i guess so . 
we really did n't go that route and did n't look . 
and the housing market probably still going to even go lower . 
there are many houses for sale just by the regular route . 
that 's discouraging if you own property . 
and we just decided sell . 
and we got a pretty good price for what we had . 
not as good as it would have been three or four years ago . 
few years . 
but that was just the timing . 
and they never did sell it . 
so they stayed six months , 
and she got her job back , 
and he got a job down there . 
they 're not moving very well . 
for sure . 
and that 's a good example of it . 
i know where that is . 
have you ? 
so i teach at a college here . 
so it 's sort of home now . 
what college are you teaching at ? 
it 's one of the community colleges . 
and it 's just about two miles to the west of where i 'm living . 
so it 's very nice , very convenient . 
and that 's about nine miles to the east of here . 
so it 's good to hear from you . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
i hope so . 
and have a good life , the rest of it . 
thank you , 
same to you . 
i read a lot , 
i tend to read only out of a couple groups . 
and i 'm a big baseball fan , 
so i tend to read a lot of the baseball books 
i 'm a big baseball fan too . 
and i read a lot of science fiction . 
i teach school , 
and so during the school year , i just do n't have time to read . 
and i would love to be able to read more because i enjoy it so much . 
but with correcting papers and two kids of my own , i just do n't have time . 
but in the summer , i try to read a lot . 
and , of course , being a woman , i like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot . 
so i read a lot of that . 
but i also love sports . 
but i do read sports illustrated during the year because my son gets that . 
and but i do n't read a lot of nonfiction , 
i do n't really , 
i probably should . 
i 'll get books on history and stuff like that that look interesting . 
and of course , i do n't ever get around to reading them . 
do you ? 
and i 'll get stuff out of that . 
i got battle cry of freedom a couple of years ago . 
and it 's eight hundred pages . 
and it was i want to read something else for a while . 
some of those books are real tough to get into , 
but after you get into them , they 're really good . 
but it 's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so . 
it 's okay , 
and i realize these things . 
these things take awhile to move up , 
but it 's hard sometimes . 
it 's right , 
that 's right . 
and you do n't read a lot of fiction , you said . 
i read a lot of science fiction . 
do you ? 
when i find an author i really like , i try to read everything they write . because you get used to their style and you really enjoy it . 
i do the same thing . 
i 've heard of him . 
is that right ? 
i have almost everything he 's ever done . 
and i know that when i get his book i 'm usually going to enjoy it . 
it 's fun to do that . 
is n't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction ? 
i think that 's unbelievable . 
does he really ? 
but it turns out that foster actually ghost wrote it for him . 
is that right ? 
when i read it , i should have realized that because it had foster 's style written all over it . 
is that right ? 
i 've never read anything of his , 
but i 've heard about him . 
does he get some royalties from that , hopefully ? 
i 'm sure he does . 
i would think he would . 
i 'd hope so . 
i mean he 's doing all right , probably . 
i 'm sure he is , 
i 'm sure he is . 
but sometimes the more you get the more you want too , 
that 's true . 
you 're a baseball fan , 
you 're aware of that kind of thing . 
in fact , i 'm a sports fan , period . 
that 's why i like to read sports illustrated so much 
because there 's everything in it . 
i had a subscription to that last year , 
but i 'm mostly a baseball fan . 
the other stuff is interesting 
but i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff . 
is that right ? 
that 's good too . 
i 'm sure you do . 
i 'm not from here . 
i love the mud hens . 
they 're great . 
i love the name 
and , there was a really big article on the mud hens in sports illustrated last year . 
i saved that issue , actually . 
did you ? 
that 's when i had the subscription . 
it was a lot of fun . 
i really enjoy that team . 
we used to go there all the time . 
and we used to go to their games all the time . 
they do n't exist anymore , 
i do n't , think . 
i know they do n't . 
at least not by that name . 
but i do n't know if they play , in the same location . 
i 've been here for twelve years now , 
but we used to always go to their games , 
and it was kind of fun . 
it 's almost more fun than going to a major league game . 
i do n't know , 
i just really enjoy the , farm teams . 
minor league , baseball is a lot more fun than , major league baseball . 
it is . 
it 's not quite so serious . 
and it 's a lot cheaper . 
that 's for sure , 
that 's , for sure . 
is that right ? 
and they have a minor league team . 
is that right ? 
it 's just a lot of fun . 
it 's free parking 
and four bucks now to get in . 
and the hot dogs are a dollar 
and it 's just great . 
if you park in the lot across the street from the stadium , it 's four bucks . 
the food here is outrageous . 
it used to be three dollars . 
but i think it 's gone up to four dollars this year . 
that 's nice . 
but it 's in the bleachers , way out in center field , 
but it 's still nice . 
you still can see well . 
and we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets box seats or something , 
then we usually sit out there . 
how much are the box seats there ? 
box seats run from eight dollars to twelve dollars . 
that 's a little steeper . 
but we 're getting a new stadium next year 
so it 'll go up . 
it 'll go up . 
it 's something we 're really irritated about around here . or some people are really irritated about . 
they built the new stadium downtown . 
and they 're saying how there 's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium . 
but i park for free up at memorial stadium because i know where i can do it for free . 
and i 'm not going to be able to do that downtown . 
it 's outrageous to go to the cowboy game . 
it 's high too . 
so baseball 's cheap , compared to other games . 
that did n't go over . 
it did n't , go through . 
and that was their main money making deal for the city . 
and it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away . 
there 's six flags right by the stadium , 
there 's a wet 'n wild 
all the tourists come there . 
it would have been devastated , 
they would have collapsed . 
and , 
that 's what i 'd always heard , 
i like it there . 
that 's about what it takes me to get to memorial . 
it actually . 
is that right ? 
because i live just south of the interstate . 
hop on the interstate , 
and the stadium 's right off the interstate . 
so , it 's i drive west 
and i 'm there . 
but i 've got to go , stop and go traffic and everything . 
i guess you read sports illustrated 
but you do n't read many sports books 
not really . 
my son does , 
and he reads everything he get his hands on . 
he 's a basketball fan because he plays for the high school he goes to 
but he 's reading it , 
and he says , he 's so interesting , mom . 
you just ca n't believe all the things he 's done . 
and he 's really enjoying that . 
and he said , mom , you need to read it after i get finished . 
so maybe i will . 
i understand there was a really good basketball book called a season on the brink . 
i never heard that one . 
i 'm not sure . 
i do n't know . 
i 'm trying to think of the guy 's name . 
i just heard about it the other night . 
and they mentioned that one . 
i 'll have to tell my son about that . 
i 'm sure he 'd like it . 
that would be good . 
even when i do n't like the sport so much , i get interested in the history of sports franchises , 
what are your first comments on that subject ? 
my first comments on the budget . 
what would be the first thing you 'd cut ? 
defense ? 
surprisingly . 
mean private enterprise ? 
have private enterprise do it ? 
you mean the prisons ? 
they 're already talking about it . 
they 're talking about having it as a business . so , the government does n't have to deal with it . 
i had n't heard that . 
but 
because i think it 's all , either state or federally funded 
but there 's not enough room in these prisons and that , to continue funding it . 
they think they need to , maybe have private enterprise come in . 
in other words , they 're in there for a purpose , 
put them to work rather than sitting there . 
it 's the same thing the whole criminal , but the whole police department of the united states . 
i feel the same way . 
someone gets picked up for drunk driving , he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there . 
i would n't want to see it cut any more than that . 
but again i 'd like to see something on the other end back into education . but not in the education we have today . 
so i 'm lost on that one . 
i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems . and to come up with something a little better than what we 've got . 
but i was just talking to somebody else , 
not so much pay . 
i 'm not trying to see the government put out any more . 
i know what you are saying . 
but here , it 's just up to high school . 
but we do n't even push the fact to the high school kids that there 's other means of education out there rather than college . 
just doing it , which would bring the education back up , 
in a few years 
it 's not going to be overnight . 
but that would come down . 
they 're not willing to put the training for only a certain amount . 
they 're trying to get more people into that field . 
but they ca n't just bring somebody in without even having gone to school in that area before they can work for a lawyer as a paralegal . 
i see it being done . 
i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever 
and she 's training her . 
i 'm assuming that it can be done . 
my perspective is that i 've been with a couple of big companies now . 
and it 's like they , are unwilling to put the time in . 
they want somebody when they bring them in , that they have a certain amount to contribute . 
obviously there 's a lot to learn after that . 
but , that 's true . 
let me change my channel , 
let me see if that clears this up . 
is that better ? 
and all of a sudden we had a bad frequency there or something . 
so we had some interference , 
so i changed that . 
it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere . 
but i think , maybe they need to help promote that more . give incentives like if they do bring somebody on , they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is , for them to train people stuff like that . 
programs like that . 
i do n't know what kind of options they 've got . 
but that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with . people , , at high school level , which i would like to see . rather than so many kids getting out of school . 
they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around . because they do n't have any education . 
i do n't mean college . 
and i 'm for college . 
but there 's a lot of people that do n't want their higher education as far as quote college is concerned . 
they 've had it . 
i think , i just heard something the other day , 
and then out of that percentage , only so many can get their degree . 
i thought that was interesting . 
but most people i knew have gone and got their degree . 
but there 's a lot of them out there that have n't . 
and 
so i think , that demographic area there a lot of them do go on . 
and if they enjoy it more , they 'll make a , happier life for themselves . 
question . 
you threw that question on me about the deficit , 
put it on your shoe now . 
what would you do ? 
my perception of the budget , 
and they have so much to spend 
and there 's not enough money to spread around . 
and that we have more money going out and too many goods coming into this country . 
and obviously the demand for their goods is quite high here , 
so they can get their goods in here . 
and the money being spent and the goods flow in we do n't sell products abroad as much as we bring in . 
one of the news stations they had on there , where the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting . 
i started when i was in college . 
they always offer credit cards for college students . 
so i went ahead , and accepted every one that i was offered . because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early . 
so , i pack around a lot of them , 
but i only use a few of them . 
you have a lot of discipline . 
they make it really easy for people to get credit cards , especially college students . 
i have two daughters who both are in college 
or , in fact , one has finished now . 
but they both have a lot of credit cards . 
and they give you such high credit limits . 
it 's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap . 
and then they give you the credit limit , 
and then you 're always seemingly up to that limit . 
i have quite a few credit cards that i 'm always almost up to the limit on most of them . 
and that 's how a lot of people get into trouble . 
i 've got two that usually i 'll have a balance on . 
and that way i feel like i 'm getting a thirty day loan . 
then they usually get run up pretty good . 
you have a lot of discipline . 
i 'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine . 
i 've paid off about four credit cards this year . 
but still i have some that are up to the limit . 
and especially the visa card that you can go and get cash on . 
and it seems like every time i 'm short of cash , i just go get it from visa . 
i 've never used my visa for cash before . 
can you use it at a bank machine 
you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card and say , `` i want a cash advance . '' 
or if they 've sent you a number that you can use a personal identification number that you can use in the impact machines or whatever , you can do that . 
because i have one that i do n't have a pin number for . 
sometimes you have to ask them for that . 
and then i have one that just gave me the pin number automatically . 
that 's funny you said that . because my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we had n't even applied for . 
a couple of weeks later we got pin numbers , 
and we cut them up and sent them back because we had n't even applied for them , 
and we did n't want them . 
but they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us . 
so i thought , i do n't know if i trust this or not . 
they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time . 
everybody in the world will offer you a credit card . 
it 's let 's see if we can get her to run up her bills . 
but it 's hard , 
it 's tempting when you see something to say , `` i 'll just charge it . '' 
and sometimes i 'll do that , 
but usually i will try to pay everything off the next month 
or the ones that usually have an outstanding balance all the time , i 'll pay more than the minimum payment . 
just i feel like even that little bit helps . 
the way the economy 's going and inflation and the recession and all that , i think we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible . 
that 's why i 've really started to try to pay off mine and get out of debt . 
because we never know when we might get laid off or something . 
i know it . 
especially me . 
and they 've had a lot of , layoffs lately . 
you do ? 
and i think they 're getting ready to probably sell us out , our division . 
where are you ? 
they just announced that , did n't they ? 
so it 's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards . 
it certainly is . 
i have worked on a part time job where i was a collector . for a jewelry company . 
they just had this jewelry account . 
they have about a thousand collectors , i guess . 
and there 's just so many people that have bought jewelry , which is really a luxury item 
and then they just ca n't pay for it . 
something happens , 
and you hear so many stories listening to them . like they lost their job 
or they 've signed for a friend . 
they got it in their name 
but they got it for a friend 
and then the friend would n't pay them . 
did n't pay them . 
and now they 're stuck with the bill , 
and it 's ruining their credit 
and you really have to watch this . 
that 's scary . 
because every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau automatically , 
most of them do . 
i did n't realize that . 
you 're thirty days late . 
they do n't recognize any time difference , do they ? 
that 's scary . 
that 's something i never thought about checking with to see what your credit report looked like . 
you can do that . 
i believe it costs about ten dollars . 
might be worth it for peace of mind . 
it is , 
it is . 
you might even find somebody 's been reporting on you 
and you did n't even know it . 
you might think you 're paying something on time 
thirty days is not real bad though anyway . 
if you 've got a charge off on your credit report or something like that . 
that 's when it really gets bad . 
i think that discover card has a good idea with giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you purchase . as long as you do n't go crazy trying to get cash back . 
do they charge a lot of interest on that card ? 
i do n't know . 
so that would n't be too bad . 
i know , 
and i had n't read the terms of the credit agreement really . 
and when i did , i realized that it just seemed like i was never paying the balance off . 
and i looked at the credit card agreement one day , 
and i 've always watched it since then . 
that 's awful . 
you really have to watch those interest rates . 
i mean , 
there 's no point in giving them any more money than we have to . 
that 's true . 
but there are a couple of states that can . 
that 's great . 
i 'll try to remember that one . 
let 's see . 
i was trying to think if there was anything else . 
i guess the worst problem i ever had with a credit card though was i got an item on my bill that i had never purchased . 
i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork , 
but they were n't supposed to process it until they delivered it . 
and i changed my mind , 
but then they went ahead and charged it on my account . 
so that 's probably the worst thing i 've ever had happen with a credit card . 
i 'll let you go first . 
what 's there to say ? 
does n't seem like it 's being carried out very well in my opinion . 
seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i do n't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody . 
it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty . 
i know what you mean . 
and i 've seen a lot of people get sentenced , 
and then just nothing happens , just endless , endless , endless appeals . 
and it 's building up , 
so it 's really building up . 
what 's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years . 
everybody 's got that . 
here it 's to the point where they were letting prisoners go . commuting the sentences of those that were in jail for lesser crimes , in order to put more people into the jails . 
and it was just amazing to me , 
and of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out . 
i ca n't remember . 
that was the one that was used so much in the campaign . in the presidential race . 
i do n't remember . 
i do n't remember myself . 
the question is do you think , it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it 's done right ? 
if they started executing them on a regular basis i think it might make a difference . 
right now , i do n't see it making a difference . 
i do n't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they 're afraid they 're going to get sentenced to death . 
most people out there committing murders do n't care . 
they just do n't care . 
but so many of the people that commit crimes do n't get punished . 
the police do n't catch them , 
or the courts do n't convict them , 
or they do n't serve very much of the time 
and so their success rate is very high . 
crime does pay , 
you can make a good living at it . 
and we just had a real big cocaine bust , 
and of course they 're playing it up real big that it looked like it was a very , very small ring 
and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy . 
i think they 've got over a hundred dead already this year . 
last year it was d c , 
it 's kind of moved up 
and you have to remember that there 's x number of people out there that are going to commit murders , 
if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that pretty soon you run out of people to murder . 
the only consolation is so many of the murders are , the violent people going against each other 
society 's not going to put them to death , 
at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to . 
i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society 
and we are there by going to remove them from society , not temporarily , but permanently . 
i do n't think much of life imprisonment . 
first of all , it never , turns out to be life , 
but second why should we , 
that means you 're going to put them in a cage 
you think it 's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again , 
then , why bother . 
just execute them , because that way you 're sure they 'll never ever going to walk the streets again . 
it makes sense , 
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused , 
but so few and far between , 
and that 's about it . 
and also the thing i do n't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it 's not based on what is true and what is false 
but rather it 's on the rules of evidence , what can i hide and what do i have to tell . 
and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are . 
and that way we can be sure , 
we can find out the truth , 
we can find out what really happened and base the sentence on what the person did , not on what we 're allowed to let the jury hear . 
my father-in-law participated in a jury trial , 
he was actually on the jury , 
and this man was accused of killing two people and shooting a policeman point blank in the face . 
of course he did n't die . 
and when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money , it turned out to be a couple cookies jumbo cookies 
just started shooting people , because they botched the first job 
, so now they 're going to get even . 
and get even with who , 
stupid guys . 
and it turned out that the policeman survived to the point that he was able to identify the guy . 
and of course they tried to make the cop look like he was a no good rotten drunk . 
it was amazing . 
what was the verdict , 
what was the results there . 
he was found guilty , 
last i heard he beat a push for the death penalty . 
whether they finally got it or not , i do n't know . 
i kind of stopped listening after a while . 
he would come home 
and , after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on 
the penalty phase , 
they , decide the penalty separately from the verdict . 
and everybody was pretty much let 's burn him . 
and that 's the way they wanted to do it . 
but when it all came down , they just , within an hour decided the man 's fate . 
there 's really two separate decisions there i guess , 
one is , did it really happen the way the prosecutor said it happened , 
is this man really guilty , 
and you have to decide that , 
but then you have to decide as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing . 
i 've never been on a jury , 
i 've never had that experience , 
i 'm not sure i 'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man 's life . 
it went pretty quick from what he said . 
but there 's a lot of other crimes out there besides murder , 
i think now if you 're dealing drugs now there 's a death penalty associated with it . 
the thing i 'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence . 
i can handle people selling drugs , 
it 's wrong , 
but it 's not worth somebody getting executed for . 
but we hear so much about the violence and how it 's not safe to walk the streets . 
and the people i 'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life . 
you , never know when they 're going to turn or hurt the next person because it does n't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not . 
i agree . 
these are the kind of people i would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say we do n't accept your kind in our society . 
i agree , 
i have , a low tolerance for that kind of person . 
kidnapping per se has a certain fine and penalty associated with it , 
but some of these people are just out and out brutal . 
do you exercise a lot ? 
it 's scaled back considerably . 
but i just nine months ago , got married and bought a house 
so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot . 
lawn , 
so , we are doing a lot of refurbish work , 
and 
you name it , 
all kinds of stuff , flower beds . 
i think that 's considered exercise whether you want it or not . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
there 's always something to do 
and it keeps me going . 
you are so far ahead of me . 
i used to walk two miles a day , 
and i really enjoyed it . 
because the two miles , went fairly quickly . 
and that 's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way , 
but it 's a lot . 
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything , 
but i do n't know what i did to my knee . 
i was crawling under a desk , hooking up a computer . 
or i did something . 
and the doctor has had me on medication , 
and she does n't want me to walk , 
so i ca n't walk . 
and she said the most conservative approach , you do the medicine again and again , before you think of surgery . 
and i do n't want her to think of surgery on my knee . 
i do n't want anyone to think about that , ever . 
that 's a tough situation . 
that 's that microscopic stuff . 
so , i 'm being very good . 
but , i miss it . 
i really do , 
it 's so aggravating to have an injury like that . 
my wife likes to run , 
we moved down to the north end of oak cliff in the castle park area . 
and she started running down there and all the hills . 
and she lasted about two weeks , 
and her ankles could n't take it anymore . 
and ever since that , it 's just been real difficult . 
it 's real aggravating , because she starts in 
and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff . even if she does get on flat ground , 
so she 's kind of in the same mode . 
she was all ready to get back into it and start running five k 's , and ten k 's and stuff this spring , 
and she just has n't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape . 
and , when you want to do it , it 's really , really aggravating . 
it 's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise , 
and it 's another thing to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health . 
can you understand that . 
i do n't really want to , 
i just , know i need to . 
i make myself do it 
and if i do it 
i do n't love it , , 
but i will do it . 
but i can really tell the difference , since i have not been able to walk . 
i have got to be so much more careful with what i do . 
it 's depressing . 
it is , 
speaking for myself i do n't sleep as well , when i am not exercising , 
and it 's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff , 
your body just gets used to it . 
i do n't particularly enjoy it . 
i used to lift weights an awful lot , and stuff like that . 
i do enjoy riding bike , 
but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that . i ca n't say i really enjoyed it all that much , 
but once i got used to it , it was habit forming . 
it was , 
i felt so bad if i did n't , 
physically , i mean 
my body was tuned into that mode , 
and if i skipped it then it kind of threw the whole system out of whack . 
hopefully my knee is a hundred percent better . 
maybe i can get back into it . 
that 's for sure . 
let me ask you a question off the subject though . 
you 're living in the castle park area ? 
that 's right . 
i grew up in oak cliff . 
did you really ? 
i did . 
on candy , 
and that area , is it changing back again ? 
so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them . 
it is . 
it 's only about a block and a half long , 
but it 's over on the other end . 
i know exactly where that is . 
you know where the little bridge is on north oak cliff boulevard ? 
we are just south of that little bridge , back-up on the hill in the trees there , 
and 
our street is an awful lot of retired people , 
in fact , our one little block and a half there , four houses sold last summer 
and three sold the summer before , 
and everybody is real excited . 
that 's wonderful . 
that is a gorgeous , gorgeous place . 
it 's a lot of fun , 
the people are great . 
there too , we 've got a real active neighborhood association . 
and we 've got four regular parties every year 
and we do a neighborhood recycling program and , all that kind of stuff . 
so , it 's a lot of fun 
and it 's a really beautiful area . 
and some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too , are picking up some of those great big houses , 
and they 're getting them at a real bargain . 
they are . 
you know . 
and they 're just going to town with them . 
and it 's really coming around . 
i guess ... 
i need to go over there and just drive around and look . 
it 's worth the trip . 
i 'm sure it must be . 
we had a lovely little house over there , 
it was a two story . 
story and a half , really , because we had a basement . 
and the guy that built it was weird , 
i mean weird . 
it 's one of these really creative houses , that i grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else . 
and i just loved the neighborhood . 
and everyone had houses like that . 
they were all completely different . 
that 's right . 
and so neat . 
it was burnt out about two years ago 
it 's got a rounded front on it . 
it 's all brick , 
and he 's about ready to put in a pool and things like that . 
so 
there 's a variety , 
why could n't your wife run around the golf course ? 
is that not good ? 
she could , a little bit . 
i tell you what , 
and they have a quarter mile track there . 
so she has started doing that rather than take off . 
the problem is she 's a school teacher 
and for her , she ca n't run in the morning . 
and there 's somebody in the building , watching her and all that , 
so there 's a lot of consideration . 
i really hear that , 
i think you 're in oak cliff . 
and we live on one of those blocks that it 's a neighborhood watch block . 
we all know each other , 
and the street does n't go anywhere . 
if you are on the street , you better belong there . because it 's not a through street . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
and , still , i want to get up early in the morning and walk . before this knee business . 
it looked darker to him , because he was in the house with the lights on . 
when i was out walking , it , was more of a predawn type , 
he did n't think it looked predawn to him . 
it looked dark . 
and even he was real concerned about that . 
so , it 's not just because you are in oak cliff , 
it 's just because you 're smart . 
that 's true . 
that you do n't do things like that . 
it only takes one time . 
that 's right . 
it 's a hard lesson to learn . 
there 's only one crazy out there to make any difference . 
it goes all over 
what do you do to exercise ? 
i weight train three days on and one day off . 
i play basketball couple times a week . 
that 's what i do . 
what about yourself ? 
that 's pretty impressive . 
i guess i bicycle . 
the amount varies 
that 's about the extent of it . 
i do n't do any of those things particularly for exercise . 
but i guess the bicycling is the one thing i 'll sort of do if i feel like i need to go exercise . 
but i do it mostly for fun . 
what do you ride , 
a bunch of hills or pretty flat ? 
it varies . 
and that 's mostly flat . 
how long does that take you to get to work ? 
it can be a pain . 
basically i work on a campus 
but , it 's enough of a pain , that i did it consistently one year , 
i would commute every day , 
but it just became such a pain . 
and then another half an hour to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff . 
it was a big hunk of the day . 
and then of course another hour to get back home . 
so i 've been doing that less , and concentrating more on light biking when i get home on the evening and then some more on the weekends . 
do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there ? 
not so much . 
i guess mostly i bike on my own . 
i 've got a touring bike . though i have n't gone on any extended trips with it . 
how about you , 
what kind of biking do you do ? 
actually my wife just got me into it 
i was a solid weight trainer , 
and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise 
and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it , 
so i began a program probably three or four weeks ago 
i usually . 
and it was pretty tough , 
but i 'm looking at doing a lot more of it because my wife is really into it , 
i see . 
and i kind of held her back a little bit this weekend . 
she wanted to go , go , go , 
but she wanted to stay with me . 
it 's good to have a partner . 
it really is . 
are you ... 
that would be cool sometime if i could work up to that . 
people seem to get into different aspects . 
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour . 
i 've never really looked into that . 
my wife would just love that . 
and i may do that sometime . 
there again , i 'm just kind of a fledgling into this . 
it 's kind of funny . 
i called this number 
and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up . 
that 's nice . 
bicycling is really big here . 
i did n't know that , until i came down here , and , kind of caught the fever . 
but , other than that it 's nothing up there like it is down here . 
i 'm not sure why that is . 
maybe it 's because of the winters . or maybe just because there 's a lot more flat lands out in the west . 
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation . 
it 's really neat . 
there are a lot of resources , a lot of magazines , and stuff , 
it 's free 
just go to the bike shop and pick it up , 
and it 's got all the rides coming up , 
that 's terrific . 
so how long have you been biking ? 
i guess as an adult for just about the past three years or so . 
i guess last time i did it before that was college , which was about ten years ago . 
and 
and so i thought i 'd try it , too . 
i have n't , 
because from what i understand , it really improves your cholesterol 
and it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is low cardiovascular fitness , and also the cholesterol . 
that 's great . 
that 's good . 
on average , 
when do you get to begin with the winters and all that ? 
do you ride inside if you ca n't ride outside ? 
in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow . 
and , i do n't do that . 
i pretty much lay off for the winter . 
i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter because it will help your balance when you 're indoor training . 
but i just more or less stocked an exercise bike and that kind of thing . , 
but 
winters are kind of a problem 
so , i 'm more or less out of shape now that i 've been biking this year for just a couple of weeks . 
, but 
it 's pretty good . 
the main thing for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like exercise and a chore , i 'll lay off it more . 
i rotate around about four different routes from my house 
or i 'll sometimes come in the school . 
it 's nice riding to school because it 's all along a canal path , 
what school is it ? 
so it 's a good ride 
as long as you 're not doing it every day , it 's a good ride . 
that 's true . 
sounds neat . 
i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and does n't want to and everything else , 
that 's motivating . 
that 's really good . 
good talking to you 
it was good talking to you . 
and keep up the good work . 
you , too . 
take care . 
somebody abandoned her 
and , she 's only six to eight weeks old 
and i ca n't understand why anyone would abandon this dog , though . 
she 's this young 
she actually asks to go out . 
that 's great . 
and 
i was amazed . 
i do n't know , 
i ca n't imagine what would have been wrong with this dog , 
she just appeared . 
my husband calls her street dog , 
but we 've had her now for about three years , 
you get so attached to them . 
but he actually was able to get him over that . 
and then he was gaining weight again , was just getting healthy , 
so , i could n't believe it . 
that was really hard . 
i was on a business trip at the time 
and the dog was being house sit , or dog sit , whatever , by some friends of mine down the street , 
so they just felt absolutely awful . 
i bet . 
and i felt probably worse for them than for me because this fellow 's wife who was watching the dog , she loved that dog more than i did 
and . she was really attached to it , 
but it 's unfortunate , 
but now , i 've got another one , 
how long has it been since the first one ? 
it was just over a year . 
it was in march of last year . 
so 
did n't have one for a whole year . 
and when she died it just absolutely destroyed me . 
i could n't even talk about it for months 
and so i decided that 's it , 
i 'm not going to do this anymore . 
my dad 's like that , 
there 's no way , 
and she turned out to be a great dog 
and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently 
and again dad went through the whole thing , 
you just do , 
it 's like a kid . 
it is . 
hopefully this one here , cocoa will live a full life . 
the vet called her a golden mix , 
who knows . 
and her nose is that pink , 
she does n't have a brown nose , 
eyes are the same color and everything , 
that 's not too bad . 
they kind of get that permanent smile to them , 
they 're always , always happy . 
i do n't think i 've ever seen them not look happy . 
she loves everybody . 
and little kids can just maul all over her , 
and she just thinks it 's great . 
and we went and took the two dogs up fishing . 
getting in , 
actually he had no trouble at all . 
he first jumped in 
but he jumped in the river . 
i was careful to keep her away from the fast moving water , 
that 's good , 
and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her , 
and then , he jumped in again , 
and he was swimming for quite a bit , all afternoon . 
he loved it . 
cocoa did n't think too much of it , though . 
she jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out . 
i pulled her out and then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad , 
but , she got over it , 
we had a little pool , 
and she did not want any part of swimming 
but she liked to get in the pool on the first step . 
and she 'd just lay there on that step and just cool off . 
i live right across the street from a big lake here , 
and i 'm wondering if she 'll want to go out there and go swimming next year . 
so she does n't run loose , 
but she could go in sometime if i 'm watching her , 
the one that we had just did n't want any part of that . 
baths . 
it was just really a fight to get her clean . 
it is so cute . 
an part of the movie is where he 's trying to clean this dog up 
and that was the thing i could n't figure out because he would go in the lake , 
normally he did n't seem to have a problem with getting wet , 
but if you wanted to get him wet , forget it . 
she 'd lay on her step , 
but that was the only time she wanted to get wet 
and she did n't want you getting her wet . 
but you really need to see that movie . 
we bought the movie 
and i do n't know how many times i 've seen it . 
and i was watching it again , 
and my husband heard me laughing 
and he said i ca n't believe that you 're still getting such a kick out of that movie . 
i 'll have to check it out . 
i saw the , previews for it and all 
and it did look like it 'd be a good movie , 
it is great . 
really have n't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately . 
but , i got to do more fun things . 
we always wait until we can rent them . 
i 'm a second lieutenant in the air force 
and so i travel a lot . 
and 
but it 's nice having a dog here , 
what 's the word i 'm looking for , 
that 's it . 
not critical at all . 
they 're really wonderful . 
it 's been nice talking to you , 
it has a death penalty does n't it ? 
they just started it again , too just late , or , within the past few years . 
for quite some time , just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty . 
but now it 's coming back into favor . 
they find it is more deterrent . 
but now that 's just what they said . 
i do n't know 
maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they 'd say it is a deterrent . 
if you compare the figures , i think that 's where they 're coming from . 
maybe they 've changed their minds . 
maybe that 's it . 
maybe that 's it , 
. they are . 
that was before they adopted the death law again . 
i agree . 
but i think it ought to be expanded to include children . 
and i 'm not sure what it is , 
why stop at children ? 
why not go to adults , too ? 
i 'm personally very in favor of it . 
i do n't care to support them . 
i do n't either 
or just for the sake of argument , i 'm taking a con , 
i 'm against it . 
you know yourself 
just recently this black man served nine years for robbery . 
and then , there was the black woman that , robbed and shot the furrier . 
but she actually killed the furrier . or someone , 
she was charged with murder 
and then , then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something . 
i did n't retain all those facts very well . 
what if we make a mistake . 
that 's it . 
and that 's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything . 
right now our laws are so liberal that even with the death penalty in effect , i do n't think that they 're going to use it too frequently unfortunately . 
i , like you , say yes 
let 's have it , give them all a shot , get rid of them . 
i guess , though , where i would have a problem with it . 
why should they be sitting in prison getting their college degree . 
that 's tougher . 
it 's easier to say it on the telephone and , 
it 's a deterrent to crime , 
but to be one of the ones that decide , that would be tougher for me . 
very true . 
i agree with you there . 
i think i 'd probably do it 
that 's a real easy thing to say that , i would , 
but i do n't know . 
i myself would n't want to be on the jury like that . 
that 's an awful lot to expect of a person , 
to kill somebody is what it amounts to . 
but that 's what they did . 
but they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason . 
or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted . 
and they wanted something more than they respect the human life . 
i guess we both agree that it should be in effect . 
hang them . 
i agree it should be in effect . 
also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement , 
so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect 
i have a problem with this , too . 
i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance . 
that 's true . 
just believe in just about any state in the union a death verdict is an automatic appeal . 
that 's correct . 
it is , 
it is . 
i 'm inclined to agree with you . 
i think so , 
there should be a limit as to the number of appeals . 
not just for dealing in drugs . 
convicted drug dealers . 
there are certain circumstances , 
and i do n't remember what they are . 
they 're on the distribution end . 
they 're not selling them , 
they 're distributing them . 
it 's for the large dealers is what , it 's reserved for . 
and they are in effect killing people . 
i believe it 's any capital crime related to drugs . 
i think that 's the way it 's worded . 
is that how it 's worded ? 
i knew it was there 
or is it proposed 
or is it passed ? 
i do believe that 's in . 
i would n't swear to it myself . 
i believe it is , 
but i thought it was in effect . 
i believe you 're right , though . 
i think it is . 
and i have to agree with that . 
i think it certainly should be one of the options . 
i 've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren , so far that i know . 
i qualify that heavily , 
because you never know , 
but to the best of my knowledge we have n't had a major problem yet . 
but it just touches so many young people . 
my children are about in the same age bracket . 
it does . 
i have four sons myself , 
so they are all pretty well grown up 
and they all went through it going through high school and everything 
i wo n't say they did n't try it , 
i would n't know , 
i doubt very much that they 're using it now . 
in fact i 'm sure they do n't . 
it 's the same age bracket . 
and there 's four , two girls and two boys . 
and i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot , 
and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge . 
that 's usually the way it is . 
it 's just try it out with their peers . 
and none of them even smoke . 
they do n't , 
my ex-wife , she quit when she was pregnant with the last one 
and she never started up again . 
and i just quit about fourteen months and two weeks ago . 
that 's tough . 
it is . 
and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by . 
my husband has n't quit , yet . 
and he knows he has to 
and he knows he should 
but he has n't . 
i do respect the fact , though , that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me . 
he 's very conscious of passive smoking 
and he 's concerned about it but , has n't quite made it yet . 
when i was still smoking , i felt that way . 
or i 'd hold the cigarette under the table . 
i 've seen all of this , 
but , now the shoe 's on the other foot . 
i 'm aware of other people smoking now . 
he will get up 
and he 'll go outside , 
particularly if they have children . 
and he tries his best , 
he changed brands to a brand he does n't like . 
he will not smoke in a comfortable position , 
but still , he 's done everything the smokers anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking . 
it 's a , long process . 
there 's a trick i use . 
how neat . 
and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one . one at a time . 
and that gets to be , a deterrent . 
he has his in the kitchen , 
have you taken anything back lately that you 've bought ? 
why ? 
and we had no problem with it . 
we got our money back . 
do you think that consumer goods are generally getting better , or worse in quality ? 
i believe they 're better . 
i do too . 
i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time , 
i believe that they 're better now , 
i think so . 
i do n't think they 're shoddy , 
not as shoddy . 
electrical appliances i think are pretty good , reliable . 
and i do n't like it very well when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out on one side . 
did you return it ? 
i had moved away . 
i had taken the first one back . 
i did n't think that it heated well enough . 
it never did get anything but just moderately warm , 
took it back 
and the people told me that 's the way it 's supposed to be 
and i fell for it 
and when i got this one it heated a little bit warmer 
and then after one year it started heating only on one side . 
so either you or your husband can be warm 
but not both . 
also , i took an iron back after having it only one year . 
i figure anybody that is dumb enough to iron , needs to have an iron that will last a long time , 
did they replace it ? 
without even any question , 
but i think it was the store . 
and have you been buying any clothes lately ? any new clothes ? 
the last thing i bought was a dress last summer . 
and the buttons turned on it over the winter . 
the buttons tarnished slightly 
and i have not gone back about it . 
that was poor quality , i think . 
i think it is too , 
and it was an expensive dress . 
i wondered if it were n't expensive , 
it was . 
and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever . 
that 's right , 
that 's what i think too . 
and it was over a hundred dollars . 
you spent that much on your dresses ? 
i do n't usually , 
but i did that one . 
but i think it should have been better than that , for that money , is what i mean . 
of course , i do too . 
i believe that we 've been talking about five minutes . 
i think so . 
good talking to you too , 
i 've enjoyed it . 
you are a good one to talk about consumer goods , because you keep up on it all the time . 
we 'll be talking to you later . 
i do n't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the jury system , do you ? 
not at all . 
and this past semester i 've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials . 
then you must know a lot more about this than i do . 
i think , the system right now is fine . 
i think it should be by a jury . 
i do n't even think that it should be unanimous either . , 
what about the idea that one is only guilty when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt ? 
i thought that was the point of a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there should n't be any reasonable doubt . 
but , if there are some people who do n't agree it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people . 
i do n't know . 
you hear , of course there 's cases where someone has been put in , prison falsely accused 
but more than likely the people that are on the jury know what they 're doing . 
have you served on a jury ? 
never . 
i never have either , 
but my few friends who have say just the opposite . 
they say they 're remarkably incompetent . and do n't know what they 're doing and say one thing in the courtroom 
and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out to air , and all that . 
when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out 
they do n't want you on the jury . 
they do n't want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system . 
exactly . 
anyone can get out of jury just about , 
let 's say i were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury 
i would n't feel that i would be being tried by a jury of my peers . 
i 'd be tried by a jury of people who had nothing else to do and were n't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things , 
and i do n't know , 
i get a little bit nervous about it , 
i 've never even been called to jury duty . 
i was called once , 
but i was out of the country , 
and apparently they thought i served 
so i did n't make any noise about it . 
i came back 
and they said the record showed i served , 
but i was out of the country at the time , 
so i 'm pretty sure i did n't . 
i do n't know , 
i guess there 's a lot of problems with the legal system . 
i do n't know , 
and it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much browbeat the jury , a majority of the jury , 
that 's hard to say . 
so , it 's , saying , we do n't like the way he looks 
i have some friends who do expert witness testimony 
and they say that juries are extremely vulnerable to sort of emotional pitches , 
let 's make them pay as much as possible . 
things like that . 
the problem is i ca n't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury , 
but i 'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be , things like that . 
i do n't think the judge should just make the decision alone . 
least with the jury you have twelve people that are going to decide , 
you 're the person 's fate . 
how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow ? 
i wonder if that 's possible ? 
i guess the judge 's time is worth too much , though . 
they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge . 
he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together . 
probably , 
but 
somebody 's life is in twelve people 's hands 
and sometimes those twelve people could care less . 
because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want . 
of course . 
it 's political maneuvering . 
the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will want to hang everyone , 
and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic . 
they 're not looking for someone who 's going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror . 
neither side wants that . 
i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually . 
i know , it 's tricky because i know an awful lot of intelligent people who just , 
and they just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that , 
they just say do you believe in such and such . 
i guess it 's just that maybe people are upset at court . 
if it was a family member of theirs , though that was innocent , then they 'd want to be on that jury . 
course , they would be barred , 
and something you have to do . 
it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury . 
i hope we 're called up before too long . 
i would love to be called , 
i 'm ready to go . 
they just have n't called me up yet . 
they will eventually . 
it was nice talking with you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
sounds vaguely familiar . 
i had n't been down in that part of the state really . 
we vacation a lot . 
how about you ? . 
quite frequently . 
i wish we did . 
we retired early 
so , we take trips pretty often . 
where all you guys go ? 
then that 's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast 
so we go out there 
all these places that i 've never been . 
is that right . 
where do you go ? 
what type of vacation ? 
it really depends , 
and so we 've been out there a couple of times 
and i 'm a real big baseball fan 
so i usually try to combine it with catching a couple of games somewhere . 
what club do you follow ? 
me too . 
i usually try to catch whoever 's in town though , 
that 's about it , 
we do a lot of little trips around here , 
not that much . 
have you ever heard of it ? 
i 've heard of it . 
i 've never been there . 
it 's really neat . 
and it 's really cool . 
so they did n't have any power 
and we went up about a year later 
and it was better but not a whole , lot better . 
so where else did we go , 
did you ? 
have you been down there ? 
my girlfriend has with her sisters 
but i have n't been , down there . 
i hear that 's nice . 
we 're going to get , probably down sometime this summer , just to catch a football game actually . 
spend a day and a lot of money . 
but it 's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around , if you like to walk , 
it 's a good town to just , walk in . 
we 'll , do that . 
you can wander , 
it 's a good town to wander in . 
i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings ? 
that 's right . 
i did n't know that . 
they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another , 
but they had a good time 
we really did n't do that really this time , 
we just visited around . 
we 've done it a couple of times 
and that 's enough for probably another twenty years . 
actually i think it was closer to a full year 
and i really have no great urge to go back now . 
that 's great as a kid though , is n't it , 
it was great , because the times that were really fun were when we had vacation 
so we basically had one of the parks . 
there was nobody there when we were there , 
we won a log floating ride five straight times , 
we just get done with them 
and they go , do you want to go again , 
i 'd like to , sometime 
that 's good , 
we really enjoy that , 
we 've been two or three times and probably . 
i 've never been , 
so , i keep wanting to get further , 
but never did it . 
it 's a real pretty place . 
one of these days we 'll get down there , although . i do n't know when we 're going to have vacation to do it . 
we 're getting married in about , a year 
are you . 
it 's up by green bay . 
it 's a place my girlfriend 's also wanted , to go , 
is it on one of the lakes ? 
i do n't 
that 's door county . 
that would , be really nice . 
so we 're thinking that 'll be a lot of fun , 
she had this book of pictures from it that were really nice , kind of like a travel guide 
sounds good . 
so that should be a lot of fun . 
i do n't know what our next trip will be , 
the first one , 
that 'll be fun . 
in the middle of the summer . 
you wo n't even , notice it though . 
they 'll be air-conditioning anyway 
is that how you got into this data base ? 
i go , that the connection , right there . 
that 's it , 
i never asked him the other day how he was connected , 
there 's been a couple of other the people most of whom are like me that work in speech labs that are going to use data base , eventually . 
i see . 
so it was fun 
actually yesterday , i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab i 'm in . 
is that right . 
and she 's working on this project too , 
she 's talking on the project too 
and i got a call yesterday 
that 's neat . 
i have n't had something like that happen , 
just getting the one guy , from the lab . 
you sure have a nice town , 
does , she , 
that 's nice out there . 
we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer 
and it never really works out . 
it 's real pretty . 
not much else we do for vacation really , 
me either . 
are you guys , golfers 
not too much into sports . 
except our outside , though . 
just walking 
that 's all . 
i do n't think there are any , 
traveling in my early teens down in that area 
and i 'm know real sure there are , 
no professionals . 
i was thinking i might be minor league 
i may be seeing them in a town just west of here , 
and i think we may be seeing them this , weekend . 
i think they 're out of town . 
i 've never been up there . 
i 'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime . 
the inner harbor and the aquarium and all that are very nice . 
have you ever been drug tested ? 
that 's a good question . 
i had a job i had to go get a blood test for . 
and they did a full blood screen on me , 
but they did n't call that a drug test . 
i think they checked for drugs . 
they just do n't tell you they did . 
i 've had , two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at different jobs . 
and i do n't mind them . 
i do n't do drugs anyway . 
i guess if i did , maybe i would 
but i do n't know . 
she 's a nurse , 
and they get drug tested randomly . 
i 've , never been randomly drug tested . 
i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about . 
i guess so . 
i guess so . 
do you think that it 's right ? 
and i 've done employee assistant work 
and i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents , on the job that are specifically drug and alcohol related , 
and it 's in the billions of dollars every year . 
and the only way that they can prevent that is , making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free . 
that 's true . 
if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever you can come to work drunk and get in an accident 
and he 'll cover up for you 
and , nobody knows about it , 
but ends up costing the company lots and lots of money . 
that 's true . 
i believe , it 's right , especially for certain jobs . 
i think they should be randomly drug tested . 
i believe , full force in that . 
i do n't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be . 
secretaries are n't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something . 
so , i do n't know . 
i 'm kind of biased , too , because i do n't do drugs 
and , so , i really do n't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me . because i have nothing to worry about . 
so , i guess that 's kind of biased . 
, , i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job if somebody else is impaired . 
it does . 
because generally you know it . 
you find out one way or another if somebody 's got a problem on the job . 
that 's true . 
and like you say , even if it 's just the secretary , if her work or abilities start affecting her co-workers then it 's still a problem . 
that 's true . 
but , what do you do about , the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before 
and it 's been the whole weekend since they 've done anything 
and they could be fired for that ? 
that 's kind of unfair , also . 
i guess it comes with the turf . 
i guess so . 
i guess if you 're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences . 
and , in terms of drugs , they 're illegal . 
so you 're breaking the law anyway . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
probably the biggest problem with those is they do n't do a real good job of assessing for alcohol . 
that 's true . 
and that 's probably the biggest problem there is . 
i think so , 
more than drugs . 
they would pay for an alcohol 
but they do n't always pay for drug rehabilitation . 
i guess that 's one of the positive things that have come out of it , some of the employee assistance program . 
if you do test positive for something they will give you an opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job . 
that 's true . 
i , think that 's fair . 
i think the company benefits in the long run . 
that 's true . 
that 's about all i have , to say on it . 
what kind of testing do they do when you went ? 
it 's a urine test . 
urine screen . 
it was really very official . 
and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and , all of that . 
so that they 're sure that you have n't borrowed anybody 's or something . 
that happens . 
i know , 
it 's hard to believe , 
it happens a lot . 
but i guess it does . 
there are people that pay other people , to help them out . 
i know . 
i 'm amazed , at the things people , will do . 
it is amazing . 
i guess there are people that do that . 
and those are expensive tests . 
i 'm , glad i never had to pay for one . 
it depends really on how strong a test it is . 
they 've got different degrees , as far as how far back they can check . 
i guess so . 
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests . 
they 've some companies that are doing hair tests . 
how weird . 
i did n't know that . 
that 's weird . 
and it 's apparently almost like a calendar . 
they 've got it pretty precise now . 
they can go back and look at , in terms of growth in a hair , when you used and that type of thing . 
that 's wild . 
it 's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
i 'm glad i never had to do it by giving blood . 
i ca n't stand the thought of giving blood . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
i did , too . 
thank you . 
what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful . 
have a big family , i guess , 
that 's a start . 
i guess so . 
how old are you ? 
i just got married . 
every four years on one side of my family they plan on having my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids . 
how long in advance do they let them know ? 
we plan on it , 
it 's the third weekend in august , 
so it 's every four years 
so they all know it . 
that 's where i 'm originally from . 
that sounds like fun , 
do they all have the small children too , that come ? 
pretty much . 
so all ages . 
and there 's some my age 
and then there are some a lot younger , about four generations , i guess . 
my husband on one side has an extended family , 
and they do n't ever plan it like you do . 
i think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind 
so they have to start talking about it , or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody , because they 're rather socially active too . 
and so it seems by doing it about six months ahead , they can pretty much get everybody there . 
if they do n't they 'll say , we 're planning to go to a certain place that weekend with somebody else 
and we 're already locked in 
but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them . 
my parents are the youngest of very large families . 
therefore , they do n't have many people left . 
i have n't known many of those people , 
but in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family 
and that 's been very nice , 
i have one sister , and three brothers 
and they 're only three out of five of us who have children . 
so we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other . 
and they do n't see each other very often , 
we do n't really know many of them . 
that 's kind of bad . 
it really is , 
they 're fun , 
they 're a lot of fun , 
but still they 're not done on a regular basis 
and you kind of forget what happened , and who they were from the time before . 
it 's fun getting together with immediate family . 
a lot of my cousins are real close 
and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that , 
i do n't know where , 
it 's very pretty country in there i think , 
it 's gorgeous . 
when is your next one scheduled now . 
it 's like , the last one was my high school graduation 
the next one was when i graduated from college , 
so i guess about two more years . 
and do you think you 'll have a baby to take back with you . 
maybe , 
i do n't know , 
maybe . 
two more years , 
i do n't know , 
probably . 
i 've been married now for about nine months 
i 'm sure , 
and then all of your family probably has not met your husband . 
is he ? 
so they all met , 
and does he ? 
we do n't either , 
but i have a friend who is working on this project . 
are they getting all the data they need ? 
i do n't know , 
i have a hard time getting people on the telephone . 
getting through to anybody . 
sometimes i call off and on all day , 
but i got off that . 
we 've kind of exhausted everything i guess . 
i think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes . 
but it has been fun talking to you . 
you too . 
thank you . 
and maybe i 'll talk to you again . 
i can go ahead and start and tell you mine 
and that 's where i grew up , 
so i was used to the heat , out here right now , 
and it gets very cold at night . 
and it 's really nice . 
so it 's pretty nice year round . 
but it stays pretty cold even during the winter , for as nice as it is . 
and it kind of rolls in over the coast . 
and then it usually breaks back off again the next morning . 
and if you go just a little bit ways in the weather completely changes 
and it gets very hot and dry 
and the fog never makes it that far . 
what 's it like down there ? 
right now we 're having the little bit of spring that we have . 
at least you 've got some . 
we do n't have many seasons here . 
it goes from winter to summer , usually . 
spring usually consists of a lot of rain . 
we had one of those blow through tonight . 
that 's good . 
and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days . 
that 's good . for this time of year . 
it 's not really been too bad . 
quite a bit . 
the season is just about over for that , 
i miss that . 
and we came back . 
what day was that , 
and they had a big rainstorm come through there , part of the same thing we 're getting now . 
i 'm glad to hear that . 
y'all were n't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you ? 
but this is the season for that . 
they do pop up occasionally , around here . 
i really do n't miss all the heat there . 
so we get a bit of a relief . 
i 'm from here originally , 
the biggest problem with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil . 
it 's not sandy like most of the state is , 
so it does n't absorb the water real well . 
once it rains a little bit , it 's filled up 
and everything else just runs off , 
you know . 
it 's a complete mess , 
we have it , 
we could use some rain up here . 
we 're in the bottom of the fourth year of drought , up here 
and they had a pretty good early spring 
and we got quite a bit of rain , 
but it was n't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years . 
and there 's no problem with water . 
and it pretty much is in the middle of summer . 
they have rolling hills around here 
but they turn to golden dead grass , for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green . 
but it 's a really nice area . 
like you said , you have the cold winter 
and then you have the hot summer spring . 
it 's kind of like spring year round , 
and that would be spring and fall . 
we never really get any of the other ones . 
but it 's a really nice change of pace . 
i guess i 'd prefer that . 
to the heat . 
i really do n't miss the heat . 
when you do a lot of outside running and stuff , it 's just so much easier , up here 
or is it pretty dry . 
it 's pretty dry . 
and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid . 
and here it 's right by the ocean , 
but here the water is extremely cold , up here , 
you can lay on the beach all you want , 
but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have to wear a wet suit , because it 's just extremely cold 
for some reason , because of the cold ocean water , the air is always cool . 
so i really like that about this area . 
and we just had n't expected it , 
it 's just completely different 
and it 's much nicer . 
it does 
and the air does n't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region . 
but we like it 
so it 's a nice change . 
so we 'll be here a couple of years 
that 's nice . 
it 's been good . 
and we lived there for about nine months 
and that was a real change for me . 
i imagine . 
parts do . 
we 're over in the western edge in the mountains . 
but they 're so good about clearing the roads , that it does n't usually bother you very much . 
it never gets real , real hot . 
and i 've just never really been in that region of the country 
and i guess i 'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it 's like . 
and they get the snow , 
and it does n't really hang around that long . 
the people i know that are from there they always miss it 
and they want to go back . 
nothing seems quite as good . 
but , anyway . 
as we were talking the weather came on 
and there 's a flash flood watch and , more rain for the next three or four days . 
i hope it moves up this way , 
but i 'm sure it wo n't . 
maybe we can send you some . 
because we could sure use it . 
you think that takes care of the time 
i think that will do it . 
good luck to you . 
you , too . 
we 'll see you . 
tell me about your home . 
it 's an older home . 
it was made back in the early sixties . 
it 's a pier beam house . 
and that just makes me scream . 
that 's pretty tough . 
what area do you live in ? 
i see . 
is that pretty typical for your area ? 
for the neighborhood i 'm in , 
this is one of the more established neighborhoods , 
that sounds real interesting . 
and i live in the basic three bedroom , two bath home . 
so , at least , i have two bathrooms . 
that 's not so bad , 
but it 's pretty typical for the area , as well . 
i 've always been interested in older homes , personally . 
i think you can end up doing more with them . 
what about yard space ? 
do you have a big lot , or anything like that ? 
the whole lot i 'm sitting on is roughly half an acre . 
i see . 
about half of that , about a quarter acre of that , i 've got a garden . 
that 's nice . 
you know , those basic tract houses , 
like that . 
we have a very small yard 
and i do have garden , 
but it 's extremely small , 
but it seems like , though , for your area that is sort of different . 
in a big city like that most houses would be sort of like what we live in . just a basic tract house . 
in the newer neighborhoods and development communities , the houses are so close together , 
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow . 
that 's exactly right . 
that 's the way we are . 
so we have quite a few parties , 
and seems like everyone that lives around us , ends up hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone . 
so that 's true 
that is one thing that i do n't enjoy about it , is the houses are too close together . 
but it 's fine for now , 
hopefully , eventually , we 'll move in a larger home . 
the only thing that i do n't like also is the rooms are so small . 
it 's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that , 
are your rooms in your house bigger since it 's a sixties home ? 
because it seems like then , that they built the homes much larger 
is that true ? 
and they 've got better closet space . 
new houses that i 've seen . 
that 's really it . 
that 's a plus . 
so that 's maybe not so typical , 
it helps a bunch . 
it really does , except when you have to fill them up 
and then you get those visa bills in . 
can you compare yourself to any thing around there . 
most of the neighborhood i 'm in is pretty typical . 
everybody has got a pretty good size yard , 
i got probably the biggest , 
if not the biggest yard , i 've got pretty close to it , in the entire neighborhood . 
that 's nice . 
that is nice . 
you have the yard to deal with 
i enjoy that though . 
do you . 
you must have more time than i have . 
i 'm sitting out here right now . 
we had this terrible rain 
and i 'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten 
i almost wish i was in an apartment or something , 
it 's rained . 
i do n't know , 
do we just terminate this 
or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time ? 
do you know ? 
after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes , they 'll get a little master recording on , this . 
can you tell me anything else about the house . 
are you working on it ? 
do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation ? 
this entire neighborhood , everybody keeps the places up real nice . 
that 's nice . 
the town that i came from is a older town , 
and that was so much fun . 
and that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline 
and was considered typical for that area . 
so it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that 's just a very square little box 
and there 's not a whole lot you can do with it . 
living in the city has some advantages . 
that 's true . 
if given the choice , i 'm getting out . 
this town was less than ten thousand people 
so i love the big city . 
i had lived in a rural area for so long 
so i 've enjoyed it , 
but it can get kind of tough . 
it 's like a rat race sometimes . 
that 's just something i 'll never adapt to . 
i do n't want to be a part of the rat race . 
i want to be basically just kind of left alone . 
if i want to sit around and mess with my garden , i 'll mess with my garden , 
it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well . 
very much . 
i really do enjoy that . 
but i have n't planted anything yet 
but i have n't done that , yet . 
i 've had finals this week . 
so i 'm just kind of trying to stick in with that , 
but since that 's over with now , maybe i can get this yard in shape . 
do you do a lot of gardening ? 
in the garden i 've got my beans , peas , 
i 'm not real sure what they 're going to do this year . 
i never have much luck with tomatoes . 
i do plant a lot of beans , because it seems like , the bugs get on them so easily 
and i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that , 
so , the only thing that i use is soap . 
i spray the plants , because they say , supposedly , that will keep the bugs off them . 
so i hate to spray them with anything . 
what do you do ? 
do you have any tips you could give me ? 
my favorite one is to put , dust , 
and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time , 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
my dad is a farmer 
i 've heard him talk about that forever . 
i guess it works , 
but you have to really wash your vegetables after that 
so it wo n't make you sick . 
let 's see 
what else do you do to your house ? 
you have enough space 
you could probably do that . 
i 've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on . 
that 's tough . 
do you not have a half bath . 
not even a half bath . 
that 's rough . 
the house that i used to live in had one bath and a half . 
and that was even just with two people . 
that was a pain . 
that 's good . 
that could account for a lot of marital problems . i think . 
you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom . 
that 's right . 
it does not make for a happy situation . 
that 's true . 
do you have any children ? 
i 've got one . 
one child . 
and they enjoy where they 're living ? 
he 's nine months old . 
so he does n't know . 
i guess , he 's a big help out in your garden . 
he likes to dig around a little bit . 
his mother comes in and says , why did you let him play in the dirt , 
i guess he 's enjoying himself . 
that 's right . 
it 's healthy , 
why not . 
he was eating the dirt , 
i would n't worry about it . 
it wo n't hurt them . 
and i turned out okay , 
so , do n't worry about it . 
just let him enjoy himself . 
you think that you want to move away from the big city ? 
i was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people . 
so you 're just the opposite from me . 
you want to go back to that , 
you are . 
that 's true 
ready to talk ? 
i guess so . 
i want to talk about our family budget , and the times that it 's worked and the times that it has n't worked and , give you a general description of it 
and you can help me out a little 
bit . 
i introduced you a little bit to it , a few minutes ago , when i said that we 're on the east coast now . 
we looked at our budget , 
and so , what we did was draw up a budget that we thought was realistic . 
and so , we had to make some adjustments 
because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that 's satisfactory , 
and we 've been here seven months 
and he 's still has n't hit up on anything permanently . 
so , you see , 
that throws the budget out of whack real fast . 
we actually planned for about one year . 
because , , it never occurred to us that it would take seven months . 
that was smart . 
and what we did was just decide how we had been spending our money before , 
and then we put that on the computer 
and then we took about three months and adjusted , where we could come down and where we did n't want to come down , 
that 's great . 
did you have a special program on your computer to do that 
just our own design . 
we spent too much money , until our children went to college , 
do you all have a budget ? 
we 've been married for five and a half years 
and we started out without kids and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot , more fun kinds of things and did really have a real strict , budget 
when we first got married we were in graduate school 
and we were just dirt poor . 
then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we 'd bank my salary so we could buy a house . 
wonderful . 
so , i do n't know if we did a good thing to buy a house or not 
but at least we 've got a place to live . 
three and a two year old . 
that threw our budget really out of whack too . 
an we have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids . 
i do n't know , 
we 've tried different times , 
we 've done a survey of taking the past three months of where all the money went . 
and we really do n't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all , 
for it to work though , you have to do something . 
and then it 's not really that realistic 
of course not . 
and they 're both boys 
so they just 
. but that 's the hardest part for us is that it 's really budgeting and some extra things that are more nonessential items . 
i found that , the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned , but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents . 
we tended to want to keep on giving lavish , gifts as , we had done before . 
and i really believe that if you 're going to cut down on yourself , you need to cut down somewhat on your friends . 
on your friends , 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
we both have older cars 
and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars on the car in two months or something , 
and a lot of things like that really are hard to plan for . 
i really do , 
i think you have to budget those things though . 
kind of put in a certain amount per year , 
you 're going to have . 
but if you do n't spend it , it should be in your bank account at the end of the month . 
let 's see , 
i forget which way we do it . 
we do n't list all the deductions 
and then we get more money back at the end of the year , 
you do n't want the government to spend your money . 
that 's what my husband said , 
so this last year he changed it , of course , 
we did n't get nearly as much back 
and it was . 
better find another way of saving money . 
but i do realize that , that is realistic for some people , 
and it was for us , for many years . 
and if that 's the only way that , it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the year 
that 's what you should do . 
because we do n't miss it , 
we really do n't , when it 's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff , 
she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty , 
so , it can be done . 
i guess , 
where there 's a will , there 's a way ? . 
that 's fantastic . 
i have enjoyed talking to you . 
i enjoyed talking to you too , 
and do n't spend any money this weekend . 
i know 
we 'll have to stay home and mow the yard . 
i pay a good deal of taxes because i make a fair amount of money , 
and the taxes that i pay as a general statement , i feel i get my money 's worth for . 
i guess i am sure that i feel that , in general , though the allocation of the taxes in certain areas , is n't correct . 
i 'm sure that probably every person in this country would agree with you on that . because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go . 
there 's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there , 
and i 'm not really sure that we 've gotten our money 's worth there regardless of the outcome of the desert shield situations . 
i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military off and on over the years of being called back and things of that nature , i 've found that there 's an extraordinary amount of waste . 
i take that as a given in any military operation 
no argument here . 
i do n't know what other foe that would be , 
but i 'm just getting nervous again , now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area . 
of course a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war , 
and they used up two thousand of them in the war , 
let 's see , 
i should imagine that , that would be to keep it at those levels that were originally appropriated when the soviet threat was perceived as being a greater one . 
i do n't think there 's very much of a threat there today . 
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in their territory over there , and who 's controlling them , 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
i do n't know what amount of , our hardware would stop some fanatic from doing anything that would be irrational . 
of course now , we used up twenty per cent of that inventory , in a matter of just a few weeks , 
and , a big percentage of that was expended , as well , 
what is the name of that ? 
and a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also . 
and that was an area that i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we 're taxed for , 
in the area of defense , 
or perhaps we have paid too much there , 
i do n't know , 
and it 's a cliche , 
but i see it myself , 
i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways . 
no doubt . 
i do n't know , 
i 'm familiar with some upbeat school areas , 
so i do n't totally agree with the great expenditure of effort and time there , 
basically , what it does , is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts , that come from local taxes and send them to other parts of the state , that are not so affluent . 
they do n't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system , 
or is it all funded out of local taxes ? 
then we had a number of education reforms , that the legislature said , we got to do this , 
we got to do this , 
we got to do this , 
but , they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it , 
and they dumped it all on the local school districts . 
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now . 
so what ended up happening was a shift . 
do you mean a complete reversal ? 
because they ca n't raise that money in those poorer districts , 
complete . 
it 's all shifted to local districts , 
and now , even the money that 's been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state . 
that 's right , 
and i have no problem , with a certain minimum level , that 's a standard that everybody ought to be able to have , 
i see what you 're saying . 
by that i mean , i 'm a product myself , 
so did i . 
my masters , anyway . 
but when i look at it to me it does n't really make any difference . 
it was a marvelous opportunity that i could n't have done , 
that 's right . 
i do n't even know if you have to perform community service , 
at least what i read , is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their , budget . 
to me it does n't sound like a lot of money , 
i do n't know what that would be . 
they had to raise community college taxes here , a few years ago . 
and , the states now do n't have enough money 
so they must charge fees . 
i 'm not too sure of that reasoning . 
but i guess i do n't know whether i pay too much taxes . 
people pay , a great deal in taxes , 
i can believe that . 
it costs me money to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country , some sort of an airport departure tax a sales tax which is getting to quite high levels , 
i 'm not sure that i 'm not up fairly close to that . 
you really think so ? 
i really do . 
i feel that in the last ten years my taxes have gone up , 
they have n't gone down . 
i pay quite a bit more taxes 
everybody is . 
what they 've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase . to keep it from becoming even more obnoxious . 
this has been really interesting , 
and i 've enjoyed our talk . 
i guess i just push something here . 
push one again , 
we just say 
and that 's it . 
just hang up . 
don , good talking with you . 
nice talking with you , too . 
we 're going to talk about our lawn and garden chores , 
do you have either one ? 
i do n't do anything with the lawn really , 
but i do gardening , both flowers and vegetable gardening . 
do you . 
we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden 
and that 's fun , 
we love fresh vegetables in the summer , 
and it 's just one of the things i enjoy doing . 
so do i . 
i had rather be outside than inside any day . 
so would i . 
do you work during the week outside the home ? 
i do . 
so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward , 
i work for a school system 
so i 'm able to do that because i get home a little earlier , 
and i can still do some sorts of things 
or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight . 
i unfortunately am not gardening this year . 
i love gardening , 
and it was n't because i was so good , 
but i organized a very large garden club , 
that 's wonderful . 
it 's always something that seems so odd to me 
and you really feel you can accomplish something 
and to help other people too , that 's neat . 
it has really nothing to do with actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that , 
that 's wonderful . 
those numbers were great 
i think it sounds good . 
i 've never belonged to a garden club because i 've always been more interested in just doing what i can do on my own , 
i 've never had , the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format , 
but i know people who do it and enjoy it very much . 
and actually , i think that most women 's garden clubs that i 've been aware of in the past are only flowers , 
what i would like , 
and you would have because they do all kinds of gardening and not just flowers like women do . 
there are n't men 's gardening clubs in this area that i know of , 
they 're women . 
and usually they 're the tea type things where they have a little luncheon 
and they do their thing . 
but flowers are primarily the emphasis whereas i enjoy vegetable gardening almost more , 
i do 
flowers sort of look pretty 
i think so too . 
but i really like to do the vegetables . 
being what ? 
what a wonderful thing . 
it was nice , 
it was exhilarating for many years . 
many of those . 
tell me what 's in your garden this year , since i do n't have one . 
in fact , i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in , 
and then i have a shady area that i need to be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun , 
and they 're better for the sun areas . 
i do n't . 
i do n't know , 
maybe this climate is a little better . 
but in the vegetable garden we grow usually , what 
our favorite is something called white half runner green beans , 
is n't that funny , 
so is my favorite . 
you know why , 
and that was my mother 's favorite bean 
she always grows five different varieties , 
but that 's the kind that produces the best . 
i think it has the best flavor . 
and they 're wonderful , 
and i pick them when they 're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit , 
my mother picks them when they 're fat 
i like them in between . 
and they 're good both ways . 
i like them in between . 
the flavor is better in between . 
size wise 
my mother does n't think they have any flavor the way i cook them . 
and i know i love them , 
but i think , that 's another vegetable . 
of course . 
i love them that way 
it is . 
they 're two different vegetables that way , 
and she would do that if we did n't tell her that she 'd better not . 
but she does n't have that big a garden , 
but she has a bigger one than i do . 
and i have four children , 
and she tends to it herself ? 
is n't that wonderful . 
it is , 
it 's great . 
it 's really her joy 
and i suppose that 's why i enjoy gardening , because growing up with it . 
i think so too . 
and we grow a lot of tomatoes , 
there 's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes . 
so , we enjoy that , 
but i actually was successful for the last two years , 
i 'm going to do it again . 
bet you showed them . 
that 's right . 
i do n't know if you have had that problem there or not . 
and they die . 
we could really talk gardening a long time . 
i 'm enjoying hearing you so much . 
it 's nice hearing you talk 
and i wish you good luck , 
so that 's not very long . 
so 
the weather is wonderful , 
i love it . 
that 's great , 
that 's great . 
it is just terrific , 
rains a little too often . 
i hope you have an opportunity to garden again . 
i think so , 
are you on any kind of regular exercise plan ? 
step classes ? 
what 's that ? 
it 's a new form i think , 
it 's like low impact aerobics 
instead of hopping and jumping you just step 
you have a step 
and you literally step up on the step and move your arms , 
it 's new , 
it 's fun . 
i probably could n't do that because of my knee . 
bad knee . 
every once in a while i play tennis , 
i 'm not too great at it 
but i try to play , . 
i 've kind of gotten out of the habit myself , 
right now i 'm on two teams 
so it 's four nights a week . 
so i enjoy it 
instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there , i went and bought a weight bench , and do n't ever hardly use it . 
i need to make myself do that . 
i 'm about to graduate from college 
and so this past couple months have been really hectic 
so i have n't really gone , 
and i 've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out 
what school you going to ? 
but 
is that lifting weights ? 
it 's isolated movements for certain muscles groups , 
you can do it with weights if you wanted to 
but you leave out of there 
usually the next morning , if you have n't done it in a while , you wake up the next morning you 're , 
what did i do to myself 
i know i 'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape , 
i feel like i 'm out of shape 
but i feel guilty for not going , because i 'm so used to going for three or four years now . 
i , stayed in pretty good shape during school . 
i played baseball , all the way through 
and working out six hours a day , usually six or seven days a week that kind of , kept us all in pretty good shape , . 
but ever since i got out of school just jumped right into the job 
and , i guess the job that i 'm in it 's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule . 
because i work some weird hours and do some traveling . 
i do n't know if your campus was anything like ours , 
but our parking lot 's in one end of the campus 
and the buildings are all at the other end , 
i did n't have much of a problem 
so , it 's pretty small . 
but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant . 
i live on the second story apartments 
so i walk up and down stairs all day long , 
we 've got a one story house now 
that 's enough . 
that 's , fairly regular . 
that 's one of the exercise , now . 
i , would like to start running . 
i 've never been much of a runner 
but i want to start , 
i want to run 
but i do n't know if i 'll be able to do it . 
just , because you do n't like to or because you wo n't be able to . 
, i 'm afraid i wo n't be able to . 
if you do aerobics you should n't have any problem running . 
i hope not . , 
we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough . 
i do n't even own a bike , 
i think the last time i was on a bike , 
i do n't know , 
i 'd be , afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike . 
you ca n't forget how to ride a bike . 
i 'm trying to think of other things that i do that will be considered exercise , , 
there are things i should do . 
i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred , 
one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics 
and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting . 
we had it for course credit , 
but still it was pretty high impact stuff , . 
definitely are tough classes . 
most of the guys were all in one class 
so she 'd kind of lay it on occasionally . 
wake up . 
you have bands , 
i do n't know , if you 've seen them , 
they 're weird . 
i think my wife has some . 
they 're just made of different kinds of rubber , 
or sand even some of them , 
so i guess it would n't be sand . 
i know there 's purple , gray , and green . 
and some of them are real short 
and they 're the ones that are the tough ones to use . 
but those classes i enjoy . 
i think with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that 's fun . 
if you do n't have one that 's fun , and not acting like she 's enjoying what she 's doing , the class is not going to get out what they should get out of the class . 
are you going to get into instructing ? 
what are you studying ? 
i 'm an interior design major , . 
not in the , aerobic instructor type field . 
i could never do that , . 
i 'd rather just be the student , . 
and occasionally i do the weights at the health club but low weights just ... 
they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups , with those things 
i do n't know 
i just noticed at our health club they will put on these computerized machines , 
and you set a speed on it and the weight 
and it makes you do it . 
if you 're going too slow it will say , my grandmother could do this faster than you . and stuff like , a turtle goes faster 
and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you . 
a little negative reinforcement there while you 're going . 
so do stuff like that 
but just i 've never used those machines 
i just use the regular machines and the free weights like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights . 
that 's where i 'm really starting to get noticeable , 
i 'm just getting real soft in the middle . 
i think that 's number one problem with everyone . 
i have n't really started to put on a lot of weight 
i guess i probably put on about nine or ten pounds , since i stopped playing , which was about four years ago . 
but i just notice myself just real soft 
but i keep saying i intend to get back into it . 
i guess at that point it would turn into a task , , 
i do n't consider it fun doing that , 
i plan on getting back , once i graduate next weekend . 
next weekend ? 
next weekend . 
one week , . 
then i plan to get right back into it . 
it does a lot for you i think . 
makes you feel a lot better . 
there 's no question the end result is great 
when i was playing ball we could run all day and not be tired . 
and you feel so much better , about yourself . 
just that you do n't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner , . 
i still do n't , 
but . that 's a problem . 
thank you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
you too . 
what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation ? 
i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force . 
and my mom did n't work at all when i was growing up . 
she did n't start working until i was well into high school . 
it 's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids . 
i guess her schedule was shorter 
so she was always home , 
always home by the time you got home . 
that statistic has been growing every year 
i 'm not sure what the future holds for that 
it seems that there 's a grass roots effort or whatever going on 
i , clean houses part-time , 
and almost all the people that i clean for , believe it or not , are mothers that do n't work . 
that 's unusual . 
i think it 's kind of a new movement 
women have come into the work force in the last twenty , thirty years 
and now they 're wanting to go back to the old days where women stayed home with the kids and try to give the kids quality time . 
and i think you 're going to see a lot more women choosing to not work after they have a baby . 
and i think with this , it seems like it 's more the upper-class people , 
i do n't see it as much in my situation where i do n't have children yet , 
but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids . 
but realistically i 'm realizing that 's probably not going to be possible for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income . 
that is tough . 
we 're looking at that now , 
my wife 's about six months along . 
i think it 's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids . 
and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever . 
i 'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home . 
i would think it would be women that were working full-time . 
believe it or not though all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home . 
they 're real active in volunteer work . 
but it 's almost like a job , 
she just does n't get paid for it . 
. i guess that 's good that they 've got something to keep them active . 
when your wife has her baby , is she going to stay home 
or is she going to , go back to work ? 
we 're going to try and have her stay home , for as long as possible . 
what do you think ? 
i would like to be able to do that . 
we think it 's that important 
and i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction . 
and i see some of the problems the kids have when they do n't have a real good family structure . 
where the attitudes were a lot different . 
there was n't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and a lot of the things that are going on in today 's society , 
i think morally it seems like people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards . 
the husbands ' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure 
and with women working so much they 're kind of pulled out of it too . 
so , kids are raised around their friends and by the media . 
that 's true . 
and that 's contributed , 
and i think you 're going to see a lot more of that in the future . 
maybe that 's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time , 
there are a lot of jobs that are coming about in computers at home , and those types of things , that would at least in some ways bridge the gap . 
i think that in the future the family unit as it once was known , is going to be nonexistent . 
what do you think ? 
do you think there 's going to be still a family unit 
do you think that the trend is going more towards single parenting ? 
the balance 
and it got higher than that for a while . 
that 's hard to say . 
families are such a strange configuration anymore . 
i grew up about the same time you did , 
and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible . 
nowadays it 's not the case , 
kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk 
and one of the reasons is because there 's so much more income in the family with both parents working . 
they get bombarded with junk 
and they do n't have to do anything around the house . 
and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad 
you create a bigger family , generation after generation but not really on purpose . 
so . it 's not a real functional situation anyway . 
so i do n't know that that trend 's going to change the single parent type families 
i think that eventually the family unit 's just not going to even exist anymore . 
like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there 's going to be more single parent families than there are two parent families . 
that 's pretty sad . 
it is , 
i guess unless there 's a major swing in the change of what 's important to people probably keep going downhill . 
and , i do n't know 
we feel that we can make it on one income 
it may be tough 
but we may have to give up on some things . 
i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that . 
and it will make the strain worthwhile . 
i think so too . 
i need to go ahead and wrap it up . 
it was really nice talking to you . 
and thanks a lot . 
go ahead . 
what kind of books do you like to read ? 
i like all kinds of books . 
and i also like romantic novels . 
i like readers digest , believe it or not . 
so do i . 
i usually read that from cover to cover . 
i like it because there 's a little bit of everything in it . 
that kind of a thing . 
but i do n't have time really as much as i would like to get into that kind of thing . 
how about you ? 
i like , like you said , real life , 
i read a lot of bicycling magazines . 
i mainly look at the pictures and stuff , 
but they usually have some good articles in it . 
but i do n't know 
i have n't really found any romance type stuff i like to read . 
i 'm more , nonfiction . 
i have n't found a lot of fiction books that i really like 
but not to say i would n't , 
eventually . 
what was the last book you read ? 
let me think , 
i tell you 
i have n't read a book in a long time . 
i ca n't even really remember . 
honestly . 
i do n't do as much reading , like i say , as i would like to . 
working a lot of hours at work 
and then , of course , we have a home 
i know . 
a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or that type of thing . 
but so far i 've only read two books 
and so i 'm not doing very well 
so it 's hard , 
if i have a minute that 's what i do . 
i find it 's real hard , 
i let newspapers stack up and magazines stack up , if i do n't really set aside a time to look or read them . 
and that 's like myself 
i miss it , because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too . 
i really do 
and i do n't know 
it seems like you can get lost in a book , 
it 's like an escape for me . 
i do n't know about you . 
if i 'm really interested in what i 'm reading hours can go by 
and i look up at the clock and say , . 
i would too . 
kind of train your mind . 
but i think you get out of the habit , like you say , 
have you ever read or heard of the book this present darkness ? 
that was one of the books i read this year , 
it is a fiction book 
it was one of the best i read , 
it was real good , 
just hurry up and go through without putting down . 
that 's the other problem i have . 
if i start into something and i really enjoy what i 'm reading , then i have a terrible time getting away from it too . 
and then before you know it , it 's time to get up and go to work . 
that type of thing . 
i do n't know 
i do n't know what you would call it , 
maybe i have a problem . 
i 'm sure it 's fast or something . 
it 's terrible , 
i really like books that you can get into 
and that 's that . 
i know what you mean . 
i like reading late at night right before i go to bed sometimes 
i just sleep better or something . 
you do 
you kind of get relaxed , 
that 's true . 
i have a lot of craft books that i have too and magazines . 
i like people those things that are about real people . 
and i like to read about people who made a success of their lives . 
what book have you read that is along those lines , that was really good ? 
to give you specific titles 
i ca n't . 
like i say , have n't done it in such a long time . 
do you know who it was about ? 
what the heck was his name , 
i 'm trying to think . 
and it was more like , 
it was tapes and things that they had about him , too . 
how he started out as just a salesman 
and how you have to be aggressive and really want something for yourself and that type of stuff . 
it 's up to you whatever happens in your life . 
it 's not someone else , 
you have to do it . 
and i find that fascinating that people can do that kind of thing . just make up their minds that that 's it , have this one direction . 
and then do it . 
do it . 
i ca n't , 
i 'm not that focused on something . 
i 'm off in all directions . 
and i 'm not a planner which i wish i was . 
kind of off the wall . 
if someone says , do you want to do this tonight and i got a mountain of things to do , it 's okay , 
we do it . 
. that 's all right . 
i know , 
i know , 
but i wish i was more the other way . 
you 're more fun though . 
i like it that way though . 
i do n't want to change that part of me . 
that 's good . 
that 's funny , 
there may be some schools you could read about and learn . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
how many people do you supervise ? 
about twenty . 
that 's not bad . 
that 's not bad at all . 
do you like your job ? 
sometimes . 
sometimes more than others . 
but 
i do . 
that 's important . 
i 've been there about three years . 
do you have a family ? 
i just got married last year 
do you like it ? 
i do . 
i love the weather down here . 
that 's what i liked , too , is the weather . 
i know . 
they do . 
and it 's so surprising how it just happens . 
unpredictable . 
i 've been up here about three . 
a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail . 
i think state farm went bankrupt . just about . 
i know the whole situation is bad up here , 
we 're having a terrible time with the recession . 
it 's not good at all . 
i know things are pretty booming down there . 
i talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day 
and he was telling me about it . 
they just sold it . 
amazing . 
that 's good . 
at least they kept the business part of it . 
it 's scary though i 'm telling you . 
i know . 
i do n't know , 
and the other part of this thing was , how do you feel that this influences family . 
how do i feel what ? 
i feel like it 's important for young children to read too . 
and what you read to them . 
when my children were younger , of course , 
they were all married and grown 
and i have grandchildren now , 
, i read to them a lot . 
that 's good . 
and i think they 've all developed kind of an interest in reading also . 
i 'm not saying they read all the right things 
but they do read . where a lot of people do n't have any interest in it at all , 
and i think it 's important , 
it 's because they ca n't read . 
it 's really surprising how many people graduate from high school , that i work with 
i get memos all the time across my desk 
and , it 's pretty sad . 
it 's unbelievable , 
is n't it ? 
a lot of people that work for me that ca n't even spell or read . 
exactly , 
and i think that that 's why reading is so important , 
i do n't , 
so , we were still in college 
and had she not worked there i 'm not sure that i would have qualified . 
they 've come in handy over the years . 
and they have become , also a real bother sometimes . 
tell me about it . 
especially if you catch yourself short on cash or if you 're on vacation , it 's just easier to put everything on a card . 
and you go i do n't remember doing all that stuff 
and it adds up . 
they add up quick . 
and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping . 
but as far as personal life goes , i guess , i really try to use them as little as possible , 
i kind of like having them for gasoline purchases . 
we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies . 
but other than that i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome , of just putting everything on there day after day after day 
how do you look at counting credit cards ? 
we just quit using them . 
and they got us in trouble , 
we took a loan and paid them all off . 
we keep , one gas card and , visa just in case there 's an emergency or , something 
but other than that we do n't use them anymore . 
if you got a bunch of cards , you get a bunch of bills every month 
and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid . 
i know , 
is n't that funny ? 
maybe they 're not really concerned about getting paid 
and then some of them add late fees on it , if they do n't get paid 
there 's no interest rate , 
you either pay the thing off 
or they come get it . 
and it 's turned into personnel 
and they come get you . 
so , they 've got quite a bit more motivation to get paid then , some of the others do . 
but that 's the one that your call center manager sees every month , 
so , you 're a little bit more careful about what you put on that , even though you can use it however you want to . 
can you use that one for personal use ? 
you can ? 
you can use it like any other card , 
i see . 
and who knows how many people , are looking at those bills that come in , and those statements , 
you 're not the only one . 
, is that okay , that those people see what it is that you are buying , 
and most of the time it is . 
but , most of the others i 've sent back 
all you get is card offers , 
i 've got three card offers now from gas companies and visa gold and some , , other bank , 
and i usually just throw them away because , i do n't want another one , 
i do too , 
i do n't even open them much , 
i throw them out . 
i do n't want to have to mess with it . 
you carry around a wallet full of credit cards , 
and one of these days it 's going to all be full . 
that 's not bad . 
i need one of those . 
if they do n't say , no annual membership on them , i 'll throw them away . 
and then they started charging annual membership fees , 
and i said , i 'm not paying you , 
why do they do that ? 
it 's just another way to make money , as far as i can tell . 
they get enough on the interest . 
and i guess , they figure they 've got enough people out there with cards , 
they 're going to get cards at twenty bucks a pop . 
there 's going to be that much more . 
so , i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son 's savings account , in his name , and got my visa card , 
so , as long as they have no annual membership fee , it would be okay , 
but i ca n't see paying someone to use their card . 
i ca n't either . 
so . 
i think you 're right . 
the best philosophy is have them if you need them , but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere . 
gets a lot of people in trouble . 
it sure does . 
maybe they 're counting on that , 
i do n't know . 
i guess that 's it . 
thanks for talking . 
nice talking to you . 
do you have any friends that have children ? 
i do have friends that have children , 
and what do they say about finding adequate child care ? 
i think that may be the key word . 
i think that 's correct . 
they 're relatively nonexistent from what i hear from my friends . 
and it 's just a matter of trust , 
i think they feel that these people are under qualified basically and underpaid , 
and i think that sort of goes hand in hand 
so it 's difficult for them . 
we certainly found that to be true . 
and that worked for a while , 
but adequate ones were really tough to find . 
i 'm sure that 's true . 
it takes that mixture of a very mature college student , who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time , and the interest to the children . 
and they loved it . 
they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small four or five years old , up until they were well into grade school . 
and she was paid very well because the parents trusted them 
and they had done such a good job . 
that 's true , 
and that 's something that we 're struggling with now . 
i think it 's just a matter of priorities . 
it 's a terrible thing to say when you 're speaking of children in that way , 
but you still have to be realistic , as well , i think . 
much as other cultures disagree , our lives do n't revolve around our children . 
and that 's bad to have to admit , too , 
but it 's just , there 's so much pressure when you 're talking about two people that work outside the home 
and i think that is one reason why i continue to be without children . 
it 's just such a responsibility 
take heed , 
i realize that 's true 
so it 's such a responsibility . 
it certainly is . , 
if i can the other side of the coin for a moment . 
most of the time . 
i just have to be honest about it . 
it 's not always , worth it . 
there are those times when i think , if i did n't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf . 
but it 's funny . 
i had a friend that said before we always said we do n't want children because we ca n't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 
and she got older 
and she said , but we never do those things anyway . 
so why am i waiting , 
it 's just the way your attitude changes 
and you mature i suppose . 
but the thing about the child care i have friends that struggle financially 
and they both do have to work . 
it 's a matter not necessarily that she might want to stay home or he , as well , 
but they need the money . 
and when i seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby to someone else , i can imagine how emotional it must be . 
and , multiplied by the fact that you do n't really trust the person or you 're uncomfortable with the situation as far as child care , 
it 's just a scary thing . 
we were lucky when our children were that age , 
that 's a big plus . 
and felt that feeling of safety . 
and were leaving them . 
but , we also learned something from that experience as our children got older . 
they are not all things to all people or all children . 
i do n't know , 
i think your patient level needs to increase as the child gets older . 
i think that might be part of the problem with some people , 
taking care of a baby is not an easy thing , 
but when you have them in , their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly . 
i 'm sure that 's a whole new ball game . 
since they 're both in school , you do n't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them . 
you do n't know what happens after they get in school . 
that 's something altogether different . 
one takes piano lessons , somewhere on one afternoon 
and the other one , of course ca n't do the same thing . 
of course not . 
it has to be somewhere else 
and it 's not adequate to sit and wait . 
you ca n't do that . 
that will not do . 
that 's out of the question , 
i 'm sure . 
of course . 
but , we are helping . 
we are being cooperative , 
what 's wrong with you ? 
you do n't understand this . 
that 's just the way their minds work . 
and it 's almost everyday . 
that 's amazing . 
it must be interesting . 
i guess you find out that you 're a much stronger person than you thought , maybe . 
i 've been finding out that i really am a nice person . 
and now , i need it . 
now it 's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly , i 'm sure . 
and it stays low a lot . 
do you feel comfortable with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home 
absolutely not . 
that 's just a difference in kids , i suppose . 
that 's true . 
one leads the other ? 
and it 's the one that 's going downhill , 
is it the one that needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one ? 
of course . 
how unfortunate . 
you do n't think that good prevails . 
i 'm living in a dream world , 
what do i know . 
as i said , i do n't have kids 
and i 'm an only child 
so i 've never been around children . 
so i 'm sort of at a loss where that 's concerned . 
but i do hear my friends talk about it . 
we 're having such fun , 
my wife and i were both only children . 
and we just could n't wait to have two children so they would be such friends . 
that 's like world war three every minute . 
i do n't know 
i have to admit , i was selfish as a child . 
i did n't want a brother or sister . 
and now that i 'm older , of course , it 's different . 
i think about would n't it be nice , 
but anyway . 
just make good friends . 
i have wonderful friends . 
that 's true 
my best friend is one child of ten . 
so that worked out pretty well . 
she never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them , 
so i guess , that 's an alternative . 
if you could just have a whole bunch . 
have enough . 
by the time the youngest ones are there , you 'll have older one to take care of them . 
that 's true . 
i do n't know . 
when you see all these horror stories on television about child care 
and 
i was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that 's been telling her mother these terrible stories 
and of course people are denying it . 
and it 's just frightening . 
it really is . 
what 's frightening is a parent to see things that you do n't understand . 
and then you do n't really know what happened . 
so how do you think we 've changed in the last ten to twenty years ? 
i 'm at a little bit of a loss , 
i do n't know , 
ten years ago , 
things have n't changed a whole lot . 
i do n't know 
seems to me . 
i guess i 'm like my parents . 
the younger generation gets away with hell , 
it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted 
but that may just be because i 've changed . 
i used to live up north . 
where 'd you live 
where 'd you live at , 
did you ? 
about eight years . 
in fact in the eight years i 've been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live , 
as you 're talking police and stuff like that it 's definitely a tough job to do . 
i agree . 
and maybe that has a lot to do with it . 
i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse , 
to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values . 
that 's true . 
that 's true , 
i 'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved 
i think there 's more pressure on both parents to work , and things like that than there used to be 
somebody 's at the door . 
hang on just a second . 
but i do n't know , 
that 's true , 
it 's getting more and more expensive to live . 
that 's for sure . 
you ca n't make it , 
that 's right . 
i guess , when i was growing up , it was still the ideal to get a home and buy house , 
and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever 
you just do n't buy a house , 
just because they ca n't get into one , 
that 's right . 
the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured , you ca n't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways , 
so . 
that 's a good point 
so , i 'm trying to think of anything else that 's changed over the last ten or twenty years . 
for me it 's kind of hard , 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know , 
i think the middle class is shrinking and the lower class is expanding 
i agree . 
and sooner or later there 's going to be a turn around . 
i hope so , 
at some point 
but i do n't know at what point , 
but i think it 's going to be at the expense of the middle class 
so , usually is i think . 
it 's hard for me to say . 
i hope it happens , because i 'd be one of those that gets caught . 
but on the other hand , there 's a lot of injustice that needs to be changed . 
that 's right . 
do you ? 
what department do you work in ? 
i 'm in semiconductor . 
are you ? 
i 'm in semiconductor division too . 
. how long you been with them , 
since you moved down here ? 
about eight years , 
i 'm over at the center one building . 
so am i . 
are you really . 
what floor ? 
two . 
i 'm on the seventh floor . 
how about that . 
it 's a small world . 
so let 's see , 
second floor , you work with linear . 
i 've probably seen him around . 
you do . 
he comes up and pushes us around 
are you d a d or something up there ? 
are you d a d or something ? 
you must know him . 
seventh floor . 
he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief . 
so i can believe it 
let 's see , 
i 've been in here about eight years , too , i guess . 
i do n't know , 
flat , dry and dirty , 
but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back , too , 
i lived in the country for several years , 
and living in the city is a whole different social structure 
i do n't even know 
i have n't been up there in years . 
i see , 
and he 's from that area , 
and he works over in the park central building i think 
but i have n't talked to him in a while , 
but 
he misses it . 
he used to go back twice or three times a year because he missed it . 
sounds like you have n't been back there in a while . 
you still have relatives back there 
i do , 
i just have n't had a chance to get back . 
catch them next year probably . 
let 's see , 
how long are we supposed to talk here ? 
i do n't know , 
i think we ran out of social changes to talk about , 
my kids are probably needing me to go 
it 's nice talking to you . 
talk to you later . 
i grew up on a farm , 
did you grow up in the farm . 
so i really had mixture of suburb , and urban living . 
i see , 
i see , 
little bit different . 
i think you 're right . 
it 's interesting 
i work in a high school . 
so i 'm comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing . 
you hear this as an excuse , 
but it 's true they are so much greater . 
and i can see why children do drop out . 
i think that 's right . 
i can remember as a child nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go . 
it did n't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me 
and you did n't have to lock your door . 
some of these are urban worries 
let 's see , 
it 's not all that long ago is it . 
we 've been having some problem now 
and it reminded me of that . 
we were living in new jersey . twenty years ago . 
whereabouts ? 
i do n't know though 
though the news media had those riots kind of blown up out of proportion . 
because i went there many times 
i never saw a riot . did you ? 
because i lived 
and what you saw was what you got . 
i 'm telling you . 
but it is interesting , 
they 're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures , 
the pressures of drug is so much , 
so much of what 's going on , is so much more serious then when we were younger . 
i think that 's true , 
i think that 's true . 
i think the other thing is that we have taken some rather drastic turns in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when i 'm number one and worrying about self and not seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family . 
if you do n't have some kind of basic believe or something down inside of you , then it 's very difficult to have anything to turn to , when you 've got something facing you like that . 
that 's true . 
i also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents children who will lie and cheat 
and you approach their parents , 
and you can see exactly , why the child is that way . 
you as a teacher , ca n't hold a child accountable , if you 're not going to get reinforced by , that at home . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
and you get mixed signals 
so it 's not always the school 's systems 
i think a lot of , it is the families , the way you were mentioning , 
there 's so much more , then that 
it starts , very much deeper then that 
i think that too . 
but whether they 're soon enough and fast enough i do n't know , 
factory jobs are so much more sophisticated . 
that 's right . 
it 's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force 
and , some people just do n't have it . 
some ways it 's rather frightening , 
it really is 
it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think , of the jobs that is out there to be done , in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be , 
it certainly is . 
it sure is . 
it sure is . 
not that i really think that they were perfect ten , twenty , or thirty years ago , 
it was a little easier though was n't it ? 
just the volume makes a big difference , 
as , uh , mother i use to think sometimes it 's not so much the kids , 
it 's just the volume of it , to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and everything . 
and all the things demanded of the mother too 
i look at my mother 's life 
she did n't work , 
for a long time when i was very young she did n't drive . 
and her life was a lot simpler , 
and children 's lives were simpler because mother was there , 
and i sit here , 
somebody was there . 
that 's right . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
and i think that 's sad if they have to because they miss so much , 
but i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go work was when they were teenagers . 
is n't that true . 
that 's why i 'm working in a school system so that i 'm home when they 're home . 
it 's not so much that they come to you every minute , 
but it 's that you are there when they need you . 
that 's so true , 
but at the same time , it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes , 
i think that 's true . 
but that 's the same 
i 'm home in the summers , 
i 'm home with the holidays , 
one is now a senior in high school 
and the other 's in college , 
but that helps a lot , 
it does , 
i have a daughter who just had a second job , 
she needed to work 
that 's right . 
i think that 's really important 
i do n't think people realize how important it is . 
that is so true , 
and it 's not that the children always say something 
but every once in awhile they 'll come up and make a comment , 
and yet we have to make that choice 
i think twenty , thirty years ago a lot of women , just did n't have to make that choice . 
i think that 's right . 
what was your name again ? 
and your name was ? 
i enjoyed , talking with you . 
i 'm going to , change the world 
i enjoyed talking with you . 
it 's nice talking to you , too . 
i certainly do . 
i think we have a lousy school system . 
and what do you think that problem is ? 
and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we do n't train our teachers very well . 
and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents . 
and then we put too much responsibility on the teachers , for things that are really not education . 
they 're social services . 
. that seems like you 've thought this through quite a bit before . 
so i have some rather strong opinions . 
that 's interesting . 
i do . 
and i was not very happy with the results . 
i see . 
so if you were to improve it , what would you do to improve it ? 
i think i would start with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators . and all the auxiliary personnel . the school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself . 
and then i would use the money that we 've paying them to provide some special help in training and particularly mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time . 
and then let them try some innovative things and see what works . and then have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things . and then from the parents ' side , have the parents support the school . get involved . 
pay attention to what 's happening . talk to the teachers . talk to their kids about school . and support the institution 
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the teacher 's in the middle . 
that 's some pretty good ideas . 
why do n't you do something with those ? 
i 've done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people . 
you should run for a school board position . 
. that i 'm not so sure about . 
i 've got a lot of things to keep me busy . 
have you done anything like that ? 
anything political ? 
my mother was on the school board . as we were coming up . 
they 've always been involved . 
and my mother was on the school board for eight years . 
but i guess that 's more than some people , less than others . 
that 's more than a lot . 
i would tend to agree with you that there is a problem . 
the methods of correcting it i have n't thought through quite to the detail which you have . 
but i believe that there 's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher . 
and with that , of course you have to pay them accordingly . 
if we paid them more , it would attract more the higher educated people to either move into that field or to continue in that field . 
and then if you paid them more , you 'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them . 
i think that 's absolutely right . 
the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board , you 're going to be rewarding people who 've been doing a lousy job . instead of getting the improvement that we want . 
and it 's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones 
it 's hard to tell . 
so it 's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one , other than how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class . 
if there 's some gauge that they could make . 
maybe not the four years definitely . 
but some certain type of position where you 're overseen to begin with . 
that 's a very good suggestion . 
i do n't think student teaching is enough . 
and then the student teacher did n't stay but about six weeks . 
so there really was no time to try , much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the student teacher improve very much . 
there are lots of things that could be done in that line , including things like video taping . 
because it would n't be hard with all the electronic equipment that 's around these days to video tape either a master teacher teaching a class so that then , students could watch that and criticize the methods used and analyze it . figure out what worked and what did n't work . 
and then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance . 
that 's good as a teaching aid . 
and the whole electronic classroom idea . 
i do n't think that 's going to work . 
i think , especially in the younger years you need to have more of the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to learn how to learn . 
and then everybody else is stuck with that , regardless of what they want to teach . 
is that because that 's where the two biggest markets are 
that 's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis . 
i see . 
i used to work for a textbook publisher 
and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts . 
i see . 
definitely is a national problem that they need to address . 
sure is . 
definitely is . 
excuse me . 
i 've enjoyed speaking with you . 
i have got to go . 
i 've got another line calling . 
that 's okay 
tell me about your home . 
it looks like a little shot gun house , almost . 
it 's an older home , 
it 's not new , 
i like it though , 
it 's big . 
what kind of square footage ? 
i would n't know , 
i ca n't remember , 
i 'm sorry 
that 's okay , 
that 's okay . 
it 's big enough for us , though . 
we kind of need maybe one more room . 
we 've got two children . 
so where do you live at , 
that 's north . 
so it 's north to me . 
up here then . 
i say down , 
you have a southern accent , 
that area , 
there 's a difference too , between east and west , in the south . and the way in which people speak . 
we 're busting out walls and things like that . 
that 's what i want to do . 
how many kids do you have ? 
we have two , 
we have two . 
do you have enough bedroom space , then ? 
we 'll have enough bedroom space , 
and so , we 're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it . and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit . 
that 's kind of like what we 'd like to do . 
we just had a baby a couple months ago 
and we 've got a den , 
it 's more or less a spare room . 
we rarely go in there , except for to play chess . 
and we need the one extra room . 
the living room and kitchen are huge , 
where you 've got to leave the furniture just one certain way , you ca n't rearrange it at all . 
i know what you 're saying there , 
ours is the same 
we 've got two great big windows in our back bathroom . 
you 're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything , 
no privacy . 
we do n't have a lot of that , 
we 've got at least two windows on every wall in the house . 
i 'd hate to clean these windows , 
i really would . 
i figured i 'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean . 
and you ca n't really clean them on the inside . 
ours are those too , 
you must live in an older home too then . 
i do , 
the house is almost thirty years old . 
so it 's not a new home , 
it 's seen some wear and tear . 
ours has too . 
so most of that , by now , is falling apart . 
it 's not just horrible , 
but this tile 's come loose off the wall , 
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile 
and i do n't like that at all . 
that is awful . 
with the great big square tiles that you put on the floor , the huge one . 
he did it in that ? 
instead of wallpaper . 
i would n't mind it if it was short tiles , 
the normal tiles , 
that you put around a bathtub , 
that would be prettier . 
but this looks like floor covering on the wall . 
it just does n't look good . 
and also they 're very heavy 
and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier . 
there 's one big one that has come off 
and it 's shorting out here and there , 
that 's one of the things we 've been fortunate with , is our wiring is okay . 
we do n't have enough power , 
or our breakers are n't powerful enough to really help with the load in the house . 
but our plumbing is awful . 
there is a shut off valve that 's outside that does n't work , 
and there 's no other real shut off valves inside the house , 
so if something breaks , we have to shut it off from the main , in the street , 
and it can be really bizarre . 
and we never know where it 's going to flood . 
we 've got power surges on the west side of our house . 
we 've got our stereo hooked up . 
it 's always ran just fine , the clock and stuff . 
but it runs about ten minutes fast , except for about a month the clock ran normal . 
and then the power went off again , 
lightning or something knocked it out 
and we hooked it back up 
but on the east side of the house it runs fine . 
you do have a strange wiring problem there . 
he put new wiring in , 
it 's all new wiring up in the attic , or crawl space , 
but 
he did n't know what he was doing , 
he really should have hired people . 
that 's something , 
my husband 's in construction 
and he wo n't even touch electrical stuff . 
he 'll do a little things 
he says he 'd rather pay the electrician to handle it . 
he 'll end up killing himself . 
that 's right . 
my husband , he 'll change out a light switch , 
but that 's about as far as he 'll go . 
that 's the way mine is , 
he said he went up in the attic and looked around 
and he was , 
he says , looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there . 
was a what , 
the roof was really sorry . 
when we moved in , we had no idea how bad it was . 
it was a wood shingle roof , 
the first year we were living there , we had to replace the roof . 
which 
is it three or five , 
your husband probably knows . 
he probably knows , 
i do n't know what it is off hand . 
and he told us it was a completely new roof . 
like i said , he did n't know what he was doing . 
he must not of . 
we stripped ours off . 
unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain . 
we had almost about half of the roof off , 
and it did this . 
and a house full of snow . 
and a house full of snow , and rain , 
and it came down , 
it did this in the middle of the night . 
we have plastic just tied down on everything as best we could , real thick edge stuff , 
and the wind came in from the north 
and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night 
and we were asleep 
and i woke up 
and i got up 
i had water coming in every light fixture . 
i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling , everywhere . 
and it filled up my light fixtures , because they 're the old kind . 
and i would go in , 
and i 'd turn on a light in the room 
and the light would come on 
and the whole thing would be full of water . 
and the light would still come on . 
it did n't blow up or anything . 
we all lived on base , 
my husband was in the army . 
the neighbor 's washing machine had over done something , 
i do n't know 
but it was leaking , just pouring water in 
and it all went through to her roof 
and it was coming out of the lights , fixtures . 
the fire alarm went off for some reason . 
that will happen . 
so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house . 
not six feet 
but it 's quite a bit , quite a bit , 
you know that , 
you might as well 
so . did you have carpets and stuff ? 
several of our rooms got ruined , 
we are on pier and beam , 
so it got into the carpeting , got into the floor . 
the carpeting was already awful anyway , 
your house sounds like mine because mine 's pier and beam too . 
they came in 
one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it . 
we had to call the insurance company . 
the insurance company was paying for the new roof 
but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired which really was n't our fault . 
we 'd done everything we could to keep out the weather and stuff 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end . 
are you finished with it now ? 
the roof ? 
it 's been done for quite some time . 
we 're really glad with all the rain we 've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof . 
how long have you lived there ? 
it 's just been at three years . 
we 've been in the house just the three years . 
we 've been doing a lot of remodeling . 
it had a detached garage 
and my husband 's built a walkway across 
the walk ? 
the home improvements . 
he does this for a living , 
it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution . 
and , i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful 
i know it . 
so i would say that 's one of the largest changes at least in my life . 
i 've seen that just in the last even five years how much they 've increased in use . or probably eight years , 
when i was a freshman in college my degree was in computer technology originally 
they were just getting out with the disks and all that , doing away with the programming cards 
thirty years ago i had a college job working as a programmer 
i know . 
you never see one of those punch cards anymore . 
in people 's attitudes . 
very possibly . 
i 'm not sure in the last ten years it 's been very different from before . 
certainly in the last thirty i would say there have been significant changes . even the change from black and white to color television . 
but i sure did n't have access to one . 
so that 's made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance , 
i know . 
i tape it and then watch it when it 's convenient 
and that way i do n't have to worry about being interrupted . 
i can just put it on pause . 
and you can flip through the commercials 
so you do n't have to watch the commercials . 
that 's always convenient . 
you skip the commercials . 
what was our question about , 
was n't the decline so much . 
i think they just said the social changes in the united states . 
how was life different ten , twenty , or thirty years ago . 
i ca n't really remember back that far , 
that 's certainly , a difference . 
that 's another one , 
ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center 
and i had to carry a beeper around 
and they were kind of bulky 
and all they did was just make a beep noise 
and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call . 
these days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils 
and they fit in your shirt pocket 
and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a phone number to respond to 
those are cool . 
those are pretty neat . 
and you can still get your messages . 
but , let 's see , 
social changes 
where do you think it 's going to go in twenty years ? 
i have n't the slightest idea . 
i was just thinking , though , about a huge social change in the last ten years is aids . 
it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago . 
i know that because i was writing a paper about it . 
i was writing a journal article . 
and they still did n't even know what caused it or anything . 
and there was a suspicion , that it was a virus 
but nobody had identified it 
i 'm curious 
what was your graduate study in ? 
but i went to work as an editor and writer , 
so ten years ago i was working in the medical center publishing a journal and writing about medical topics . 
and , let 's see , 
twenty years ago , i guess we were just beginning to get into what they were calling the sex revolution after the pill 
and freed people up from worries about illegitimate pregnancy 
thirty years ago there was no pill . 
you think that 's caused a lot of pressure on younger kids today , to make choices that they probably should n't have to make ? 
i do . 
i really do . 
i have four kids in college right now , children and stepchildren 
and i know that the expectation for them was to have sex and , much earlier , than the expectation when i was in college . 
but , they certainly did n't expect everybody to 
and it was really only acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in the relatively near future . 
it 's kind of scary when i think of what will happen in twenty years when i have kids and they 're grown and just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more 
and i guess the answer , is , stay flexible because nobody can predict what 's going to happen in twenty years . 
seems like it ca n't get much worse . 
i certainly would n't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what my kids were likely to be like . 
course , one of them was just a brand new baby twenty years ago , 
so i sure would n't have been able to predict for him . 
and some of the other ones were n't born . 
electronic mail . 
i just got on that , about a year ago 
and that 's made a difference in the way i do my job because it 's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things . even when they 're on another continent . 
it 's pretty wild . 
that reminds me , 
federal express was around ten years ago , 
but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency 
and nowadays people use fed ex , all the time . 
sure do . 
people do seem to travel more . 
i was almost thirty before i got off this continent . 
and both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school . 
and they were thirty years ago we would n't have done that . 
and especially come home every couple months . 
probably the biggest thing we 've got going now is the robberies 
and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have . 
how about you ? 
i do n't actually live in the city , 
but i 'd probably say that 's roughly right . 
but i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i 'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution and sale of drugs . 
probably right , if you look at it from that stand point . 
is there anything that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing ? 
where i live now it 's not so bad . 
i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it . 
but i do have friends that live in the city 
and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . just because there are crack houses on their street and stuff like this . 
do you live in a real small town or out in the country ? 
i live out in the country , 
we are considered in the country , 
but it does n't really feel like you 're in the country . 
our major crimes in our immediate town is probably house robberies 
however , i 'm sure they 're there . 
that 's huge . 
it 's cut back considerably , 
but it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood , 
so it still remains city wide , pretty high . 
are there any theories on why this is happening ? 
i would say the majority of it 's happening during the day between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon . 
but why ? 
why is it happening ? 
most families are young 
and both people are working . 
so they 're happening during the hours they 're gone from work . 
so i would say that 's probably their prime motivation . 
they 'll stock your house and look at your pattern and then go from there . 
so they 're professionals ? 
they classify most of them as professionals . 
guns , that sort of stuff . 
very few penny ante stuff . 
what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime ? 
the police force , for one , 
i think they could definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use . 
right now we are about thirty thousand people 
and there 's only eight officers that patrol for that amount of people which is not very many . 
it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher , 
in other words , you 've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit . 
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place . 
course in our particular state we have the prison overcrowding , whatever , 
so they 're giving the early release , 
they 're doing that in our state , too . 
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences , 
so you think that would be a deterrent ? 
that would certainly be a deterrent . 
what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty ? 
i think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty in a lot of cases . 
so you 'd rather see it harder to convict somebody . 
i 'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence to convict somebody 
and then those convicted , especially of murder and , major crimes to reach the life sentences and death penalties and follow through with that . 
especially in the case of murder 
and the individuals got caught , 
we went through the court system and all that sort of thing 
did you sue him under the civil system ? 
do what now ? 
did you sue him under the civil system ? 
i 'm not real familiar with that . 
you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something and try to get money from him 
the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him 
and they said , he has no job , 
he has nothing , 
there 's nothing that he has that you could go after . 
makes you wish that . 
but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt . 
they do n't do that here . 
course they pay them , 
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money . 
that 's too bad . 
and , right now they 're reluctant to go after him because they 're repeat offenders , 
they been in jail before , 
they 've been released several times , which is another deal i hate to see . 
but basically the guy commits three major crimes and car theft on top of it , destroys my car , 
i think that 's , 
and the guy gets out in two months 
that 's awful . 
and he goes out and commits it again . 
fact , he 's back in jail now . 
what deterrent does he really have ? 
they 've actually waited for them , where they 've robbed particular neighborhood , 
then other people will wait up and wait for somebody to do something else , try to take it in their own hands . 
course it does n't always work out in their favor . 
but nevertheless , i think people are just getting fed up and saying you ca n't arrest all of us , 
you can get some of us , 
you ca n't get all of us . 
and we 're beginning to see more and more of that . 
and that 's a deterrent , too . if you think the home owner might be armed and awake 
here you break in , 
and you 're going to get shot . 
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death . 
and it helps for a while 
but then just another different set of people come in , 
so people who do n't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever 
it 's not many from the local communities . 
but it 's a problem , 
and i think that the court systems need to be stiffer in their penalties , 
would be a definite deterrent 
and , giving the police agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they catch these people . 
i tend to agree with you . 
there 's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and worry about these things where people are getting hurt . 
and i think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is , if someone is found guilty of a felony level offense , they lose their citizenship . 
and they lose their constitutional rights . 
and just a lot of things that we 're trying to worry about protecting these people from , we just do n't protect them . 
i know in my wife 's case , they made her feel like the criminal . 
i know , 
and i think that 's ridiculous . 
i 'll offer anything that i can on the subject . 
my husband and i just moved here recently 
and we bought this house about year and a half ago . 
what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom , two bath , brick house which is completely different from what i had had before . 
when i was working and before i married i lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and historic old houses and things like that 
so it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled , jacked up new plumbing , new wiring , wallpaper , paint , 
everything you can think of , that house had to have . 
you are experienced i would say . 
i really did enjoy it , 
it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it . 
i agree . 
i have done something like that , too , only not nearly as extensive . 
but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch , style home . after having a one that was historical looking . 
it is . 
it is . 
that 's true . 
when i met my husband , he was living in an apartment at the time 
the market was so good , 
we had n't really planned on buying 
you can get things for such a song . 
so , that 's really why we ended up in a house like this . 
this is not what we want to stay in forever , because i 've found that after doing this other house , i have to have my hands into stuff 
and i 'm always just wanting to paint and wallpaper and redo and redo , 
maybe you can make that one charming and make a little bit money , 
that 's the key , 
new carpet and everything 
so we 'll see how much longer we 're here . 
so i know , of what you 're talking about , as far as the market was concerned 
and i 'll tell you we had kind of a charming house . 
i spent almost three years redoing . 
and i considered it a full time job 
it is , 
i see , 
and so , i think some of the things that i did paid off . 
for instance , one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you was something i did on the outside . 
i love old estate sales . 
i happened to go to just a little estate sale just a little white frame house , where the couple was very old , and had gone into nursing homes 
and all the men started going down to the barn . 
that 's where i need to go . 
i 'm going to the barn , too . 
they auctioned some tools and , things like that , 
work , 
and , so my husband and i loaded bricks in his , pickup truck for days . 
but , what we ended up with was about four thousand . 
we had built a deck on the back of that house , 
and , it was quite large into the yard 
something . 
but , on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together . 
how fun . 
how nice . 
and he did the digging , which was about six inches , 
but i figured the sand and all , had that delivered and , leveled it and , placed most all the bricks . 
i bet . 
and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way . 
it nearly killed me . 
let me ask you , 
when you laid those bricks , 
i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago , 
they 're fixing to sell it again , and move again . 
my mom 's like i am . 
and they have to be doing something constantly . 
but they have a problem with these little sand bugs or something that drill in between all these bricks . 
and , of course you have the weeds that come up in between the bricks and things like that . 
i did get some material and studied every bit of material that i could study , 
but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them , 
i see . 
and we put them on a base of four inches of sand 
and then we swept sand in between , 
but it was an error to leave an eighth of an inch or whatever . 
you just put them together as close as you can . 
as tight as you can . 
every spring my mom says we 're going to have a barbecue and tell everybody , guess what , 
we 're going to pull up all the bricks , 
but they just have n't brought themselves to do it . 
the thing that 's funny is they 've done things like that , 
i 'll catch her out there spraying around , 
and then it 's like , in two days time they 'll come home from work 
and those little things are back . 
it 's just , they 're the most resilient little characters 
and so , i do n't know what they 're finally going to do . 
hopefully they 'll sell the house , and go somewhere else . 
i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are 
and then she wo n't have to worry about it . 
what are these things ? 
what it is that 'll , take care of them . 
and they 're , awful hard to do anything with . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
but my dad farms 
and she 's always telling him , is n't there something that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray out in the field , that you can get rid of , these bugs , 
it might do it , 
she 's got just a gorgeous yard , so many flowers and her four cats , 
so she 's sort of real funny about what she sprays . 
i know , 
as i said when i heard what the subject was , i thought i have n't thought about what i went through at that other house in so long . 
i 've been so busy . 
but i do n't know 
and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do . 
i just had a ball with it , 
it was so much fun . 
good . 
and i 've sworn up and down , 
and the one thing that she ended up with was the old door , that was on the front door of that house 
and she has that up in her attic 
i 'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does . 
so , as far as looking toward the future that 's my plan . 
do you have any particular thoughts about the school system ? 
i agree with you a hundred percent there . 
and , it 's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything . 
it 's gotten way beyond teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something . 
it 's interesting 
because we 're just having conversation on this with a couple of people yesterday . 
and , it 's seen more so because when you call parents up , many parents wo n't even recognize that there is a problem 
and they 'll say , my kid , 
i 've never heard anything about this before . 
this is the first time there have been problems . 
and , you wonder , do n't these parents know that teachers talk , 
and we do check with other teachers , 
and other teachers find the same things in this child . 
and how do you tell the parent , wake up , and smell the coffee . 
but it is a problem , 
and i 'm not sure just how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it . 
you ca n't really expect that parent who 's , quite frankly a loser in life , as it is to care about the situation with their child , 
that 's right . 
you know what scares me too , is that we have yet to see the biggest effect of the crack children in the school system . 
these are children that are born with low attention deficit 
and what 's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system . 
that 's really scary . 
but i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve , 
and this is something that i see . 
and in fact they 're not . 
they 're behavior problems . 
and so , they get put in our school system , in a class that 's limited for skills children that really have to master skills . 
and that 's not their problem . 
we have an international population . 
they got thrown right into the total mainstream 
and there really needs to be a bridge , some sort of transition for that . 
so the school systems can improve , both in standing up for splitting classes having slow children in slow classes , but not mixing them with behavior problems . 
and then the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes , 
you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated . 
and then you throw in kids that are not motivated , maybe bright , 
but they 're discipline problems . 
the average classes really are problems because you 've got such a mixed bag there . 
i would take a person who 's motivated and a little less intelligent than the person who is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of , is n't motivated to do anything . 
and i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me , 
mine were good , 
but they were n't great . 
and when i got into college i struggled just to get my degree in the field that i was in . 
whereas i knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all , 
but they got motivated in college 
and they did a lot better than i did . 
i guess kids do mature at different ages too . 
and as a teacher you try to be understanding that there are different ages , 
kids are , 
got a kid that just a question of maturity , 
or is he a problem child . 
we 're alerted 
we 're alerted the moment we see something . 
if we see a child that 's on drugs , such as if he 's got a beeper or , if they 're flashing lots of money around . there are certain things to do . 
so the school system 's asked to do so much , 
but you ca n't operate in a vacuum . 
and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the principal . 
what could they possibly be thinking . 
it 's for drug use . 
they ca n't imagine for anything else . 
it 's amazing , 
but you get all sorts of things in the schools , 
you 're alert to the kid who suddenly has a behavioral change , 
and you refer them to the nurse . 
and you have to find out whether there 's a legitimate reason , or whether this is a warning signal . 
and parents frequently resent when you ask them . is there a problem that we should be aware of ? 
i was sitting in the barber shop . 
i 'm an officer in the air force , 
and i was having my hair cut 
and the barber got a call while i was there from his son 's school . 
his son 's in high school . 
but this guy was there 's no problem with my kid . 
my kid 's a great kid and all this . 
the kid had missed all these classes , 
and basically his answer was , i gave him permission to miss . 
the denial mechanism is really strong 
they 're manipulated by their children . 
i 've been fortunate . 
and my other son is a senior in high school , 
and they 're really super . 
and we 've been very fortunate , 
but they had to be held accountable too . 
at some point a parent does help their kid , in some ways , 
but you have to say at what point is n't the help becoming negative . 
and i think this is where the school system is suffering , and not through any fault of the effort of the school system . 
but it was good talking with you . 
it was good talking to you too . 
so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do , and are connected with the schools . 
i 've had interesting conversations on several subjects not just this but the different things . 
it 's amazing how the people you talk to have some interesting conversations 
and it 's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base , and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all . 
we are , though . 
that 's true . 
listen , 
good luck . 
take care , 
quite a few 
and they 're varied . 
i do a lot of gardening . 
i go to estate sales , which takes up a lot of time . 
what do you mostly do ? 
mostly right now i do a lot of sports 
and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible . 
that should be fun . 
fun for them . 
how old are they ? 
i 've got a little girl who 's six and a little girl that 's three . 
i think that 's better than having that party at home . 
this is a friend 's party 
so they 're looking forward to it . 
what a help that is . 
not that long . 
but , we needed to get back to our older parents . 
very much . 
what did you all do ? 
we came east . 
so is he working there then 
he 's doing quite a bit of consulting work and , has been offered a permanent position 
it 's just wonderful after all , these years of working . 
i think she 's a temporary worker . 
i see . 
so , we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country . 
i see . 
my wife has talked more than i have , 
she 's talked to four , five different people . 
what is her name ? 
i have n't talked to her . 
the call was probably for her . 
so we put hers in . 
but like i said , we 're getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party , 
i 've only talked to one or two 
so , that 's interesting . 
you have n't told me what sports that you are active in . 
the sport i like best probably is basketball . 
during the summer months it occupies quite a bit of my , time . 
but , i play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend . 
but , my family usually goes with me . 
we try to do everything we can together . 
i think that 's easy entertainment for a , family , too . 
that 's usually the team i play on with the tournaments and stuff , 
and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age . 
so they play together , pretty well 
under the stands . 
under the , bleachers . 
pretty much . 
that 's kind of nice . 
it 's like getting together with , them . 
it 's getting , a little hot , is n't it ? 
so to speak . 
so we have n't really had any kind of real heat . 
i think it 's going to be warm enough this afternoon , 
so , it looks like an air conditioner , day . 
it sure does . 
or maybe this evening anyway . 
but i 'm sure you 're familiar with that living , here . 
very , much so . 
so , we drive , up there . 
it does n't . 
. i know i 've seen , the sign somewhere . 
sure you have . 
an awful lot of people know where it is , or have been there . 
and it , was a very self-sufficient wealthy town , for a long time , anyway until everything happened , 
the bottom fell out . 
it 's beginning to do well . 
but , there 's a lot of old time wealth there that , has helped to stabilize things . 
something like that . 
and you really like , it there ? 
i 've heard so many people talk about that area . 
i 've never been there 
it 's , pretty . 
but they sure , say it 's pretty . 
the weather is wonderful . 
we had so many wonderful days . 
is n't it , funny how , your standards change ? 
it really does . 
and it rains a lot there . 
but , you get used to it . 
it 's like a fine mist all the time 
it gets to where it does n't bother , you . 
that 's the way it was , there , too . 
i know you , need to go . 
and i 've enjoyed talking to you . 
i have enjoyed talking to you , too . 
it was nice , to talk to you . 
so much . 
thank you . 
and i hope you enjoy , and get through that birthday party . 
i hope , i live through it . 
i do , too . 
that 's what i hope . 
a lot . 
what do you think are some current trends in the way families spend time together , based on what you 've seen . 
i think that it 's getting to where they 're not spending time together . 
in my situation , today , on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together , my husband 's been off doing his thing all day today , 
and i 've been off doing my thing all day 
are you newly married , 
two years . 
same situation here , 
i 've been married about ten months , 
i know what you mean . 
he 's a record collector and a hot wheels collector . 
that 's wild . 
so he was off today looking at records . 
and i was off doing household type things laundry 
and did some shopping and stuff . 
because they look back 
i think . 
i think that would be the ideal situation , 
i think that would be the ideal situation . 
in my case i do shift work . 
i do n't have that choice . 
same here . 
i have to be at work at x hour , at a certain hour 
and it 's not flexible . 
it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours 
and maybe after we decide to have kids i might find a job that has flexible hours . 
i hope so anyway . 
but i do n't know . 
it 's really kind of sad , 
some of the people that i work with when i worked on second shift their kids go to school during the day 
and then they would n't see them at night , because they would be at work and the kids are all ready in bed . 
so it was really sad , that a lot of families have to have dual income . 
a lot of people choose to , which is fine . 
but then the kids kind of suffer . 
it would be nice to be able to just have , like , back in the old days back when i grew up , 
the mom stayed home and raised the kids . 
my mom did n't go back to work until i was in junior high school . 
and that was nice 
and i liked that 
and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids . 
i do n't think it 's going to be realistic . 
i know . 
unfortunately , that 's probably true . 
do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids 
i think very few spend quality time . 
i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff like that . 
i think that most kids that i see they do n't really value quality time . 
it 's always that way until it 's too late . 
until they 're older 
and then they look back . 
it 's true . 
what are some other questions they have , 
i 'm not sure . 
i know my parents are growing up , 
we did n't really have one . 
and they spent a lot of time outside with us and stuff , 
but my dad had his own business 
and it was easier for them to do that , 
but , i do n't know , 
i guess i did n't realize what a luxury it was at the time . 
that 's a good way to put it . 
and not a very good one at that . 
that 's a pretty good way to put it . 
if you had kids , what kind of things do you hope to do ? . 
i hope to , of course , be able to teach them right from wrong . 
i work part-time also , 
a lot of people that i work for are , mothers that stay home . 
and they do a lot of volunteer work 
and they 're real active in the community 
and they do a lot of things with their kids that they would n't ordinarily be able to do if they were working . 
and i 'd like to be able to do that . 
i 'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids . 
do volunteer work and , be in clubs and stuff , 
i agree . 
i hope that happens , in my case . 
but , i think that 's for the few and far between . 
and i do n't really see that trend changing much , 
if anything , i think , there 's going to be fewer and fewer single income families . 
i know . 
i do n't even know what day care is really all about because i never went to a day care center , 
i never had that kind of experience . 
i do n't even remember them being around when we were little . 
it seems like that 's a big trend in the last ten years . 
it 's like a home away from home for a lot of them . 
i guess we could ring this off since we 've exhausted all of our ideas , 
we seem to agree . 
i think this is a good closing point . 
it was really nice talking to you . 
you too , 
i wish you the best . 
you too . 
there we are . 
tell me , 
what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up ? 
when they were little , we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks , and things of that sort , 
and , i had two boys . 
they were both interested in things like model rockets , 
so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets . 
i have two boys also . 
so , in order to have a reason for being there , especially as they got older , i became involved in it too 
so we were always together at their meets . 
that 's good . 
mine were not terribly sporting . 
but neither one of them carried on the sports after that . 
the boys tried those , 
they started swimming when they were seven and eight , 
and they really loved it , 
one is in college , 
and the other will continue to swim in college , 
and they 're fortunate , 
they even made nationals . 
wonderful ! 
that 's great ! 
and so we would drive up to see that whenever it was reasonably close , 
but , we did a lot of things , 
and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children , 
so we would always go in for the museums . 
that 's always a big thing . 
and one of my children is also a musician 
and my other child is big into tropical fish , 
so our whole family , we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows , 
they were interested in a lot of things , 
but nothing to quite that depth , i guess . 
i do n't think we 've missed a fish store on the entire northeast coast of the united states . 
in fact , it 's funny , 
when they were younger we would go to the beach , 
so we did try , 
and of course we learned too . 
and , i do n't know , 
when they were very young i did not work . 
i started working half-time when they were at the nursery school . 
and i started working part-time when they were in junior high school and high school , 
and i worked in the school system , 
and now i work a full school day , 
but that leaves me off on holidays and summers . 
i think , they need you in different ways . 
that 's true , 
you want to be around for the crisis and things like that , 
that 's right . 
that 's for sure . 
that 's for sure , 
do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see ? 
the one trend is that with so many more women choosing professional careers , there are fewer of them home in the afternoons , 
and i do n't think it needs to be the mothers , 
but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours . 
it was funny , 
i can remember , 
and my mother and i have talked about it , to how important it was when i came home from school . 
it was n't really conversation , 
but there were always things that just tumbled out . 
when it 's not there they miss it . 
i think that 's true , 
even when i was there , my boys did n't share all that much with me , 
and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother . 
i realize that , 
but it 's funny , 
they do n't always do it , 
but occasionally they do , 
and when they do , there 's a reason for it , that they 're sharing it , 
and at least i 've wanted to be available , when for some reason , they were bouncing something off of me . because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about , 
who would they ask ? 
that 's right . 
or what would they do ? 
that 's exactly right . 
but it 's been interesting particularly because the society in which we live , families are separated . 
i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives . 
i did too . 
every weekend there was some visiting somewhere . 
it 's not that constant thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins . 
when my kids were quite small we lived close to both sets of grandparents 
and they saw them a lot , 
but they do n't have any cousins , 
or they did n't , 
their cousins are about ten years younger . 
so they never played together or anything . 
and there are only two of them 
and they did n't live in the same town . 
you do n't have the families , to take up the gap . 
that 's right . 
and so the kids in some ways are suffering a little bit , in that the family issues that get discussed , and all these are very important parts of them growing up , 
so we try to do it as well as we can . 
we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone , 
and we do , 
but although it 's not the same , we are , 
and that 's part of teaching too , is what a family is like , 
everyone makes its own model , 
but it seems that there should be some continuity , 
and it 's helpful to have things that become family traditions , and that sort of thing . 
and that 's always been a little bit of a tradition that we 've had . 
this year , it was hard with our son now being in college . 
so this was one thing that we were n't able to do this year , 
but we did that from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until our older son went away to college . 
that 's the kind of thing that they will remember , though . 
and then you took it off and put it on the tree , 
so at the end you had a decorated tree . 
we threw it way last year . 
how nice . 
and they look today as new as they did when she gave them to us , 
and there 's a ring 
and you buy a present , 
i see . 
and you wrap the present up , 
how cute . 
i 'm sure he appreciated that ! 
and it was fun , 
but that 's a tradition 
and those will be passed on to them when they get married and leave . 
you were saying what other trends are there , 
and that is the trend in a lot of lower class areas , for the grandmothers to be raising the children . 
a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs . 
and the broken families . 
and it 's that grandmother figure , not only raising her own children , but raising children from the streets , too , frequently . 
we 've been studying this in our school , that not the symptoms , it 's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing , 
it 's a rite of passage . 
most of it is from the radio and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon . 
we usually watch the local news and the , national news both . 
i 'm pretty much the same . 
i 'm a graduate student 
and i read a lot for school 
and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i 'm reading so much all the time . 
and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast . 
you can always get up and leave that . 
that 's true . 
i just do n't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper . either 
by the time i get home from work , it 's already time for the news to come on . 
that 's right , 
so , it 's so much easier to sit there 
and besides , i can be doing other things and still listen to the news . 
that 's right , 
i agree . 
a lot of times i eat while i 'm watching the news . 
the same thing . 
i think they did a great job . 
i thought so too , 
for a while when we were really interested we saw it all the time . 
and then the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought was really good . 
and you could always find some channel that had something on 
but you did n't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time . 
just news , 
that 's right , 
they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings , 
that 's great . 
or if you have a break in the middle of the day , you take a coffee break you can always stay informed . 
that 's really good . 
i used to watch , 
i 'm a college teacher 
and sometimes i teach in the evening 
so i 'll miss the evening news . 
i think that really has changed the way i look at the news . 
we do n't get it either , 
we live out in the country , 
and we just do n't have it available out there where we are . 
and sometimes we 'd watch the weather stations . 
that 's same , 
when i had it , i watched it religiously for half an hour 
and then you could go on to do what else you wanted to do . 
i find i read very little , 
i do n't even get a regular newspaper 
i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work , 
i find i spend so little time in the car that i do n't really listen to the radio , 
i do n't , 
so television is my main new source . 
i get that too , because i 'm in a van pool , 
and i 'm in the van two hours a day 
to commute to work ? 
and in the morning i try to sleep because it 's dark . 
but in the afternoon i try to read 
so i can , not pay attention to what our driver is doing . 
and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas , 
that 's necessary . 
i have two kids over there . 
in d c area . 
one works for the state department 
and her husband is in the navy 
it 's funny , 
there 's only an hour , less than that between the two 
but there is a big difference in things like property values 
and the closer you get to , d c the more expensive it is . 
i like it a little bit better , too . 
it 's interesting though to meet different populations . 
that 's an interesting perspective . 
but i really much like the hometown area , 
it 's funny , 
you can watch different news . 
it was just a big thing recently 
i heard about that . 
she 's big in the democratic party 
so that 's good , 
so she has good national ties , 
but she also was something like a state auditor or something like that before this position . 
she was a state auditor , 
and then she left that to get a position with the democratic party 
and now she ran for mayor , 
and she 's cleaning house 
you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there . 
from what i pick up on the news it 's a difficult process to get rid of a bad mayor . 
i know both of my kids did n't want to live anywhere around the downtown areas , 
they both moved way out . 
and i ca n't remember where the other one lives . 
it 's a nice area . 
it means they have to drive a little bit , 
they might be car pooling too . 
do they car pool in ? 
are they driven by themselves . 
because he 's got fairly regular hours since he came back , 
because she had been called back up , 
active duty . 
so , i have n't talked to them this weekend , 
i do n't know what the situation is , 
they did n't call you for mother 's day ? 
we were gone . 
you were n't home ? 
we were n't home 
but she had called and left a message on our recorder 
but i had that from all my kids except for one . 
that 's good . 
i guess we should stop now . 
i thank you for calling , 
i have enjoyed it . 
i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the united states , 
so do i , 
i 've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever , 
i really enjoyed it . 
it 's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective . 
it 's interesting to see the wider world , 
so i enjoy it . 
thanks a lot , 
and . 
thank you , 
i 've only been here for the last ten years , 
where are you from ? 
there 's a place i 'd like to visit . 
unfortunately , a little bit too young to really appreciate . 
that 's neat . 
i was grade school age . 
my husband took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war 
and so we 've seen lots of pictures of the beautiful , spots and , areas , 
that would be to me , a really nice vacation because i 'm not in physical shape for something like that , 
but i sure would work on it , if i had an opportunity like that . 
. 
that 's neat . 
. 
so , we both like to go to dive resorts . 
and we dove there . 
but , we were n't able to get enough people together for the trip . 
and we could n't get enough people together to go , 
so it ended up falling through . 
we were going to get a really good price . 
but we 've never really did any diving or anything . 
little bit of , water skiing . 
but , not much of anything else . 
my husband and i both like water , 
so any vacation that we go on is usually , close to the ocean , or something like that . 
it 's got to be the water . 
when we were in jersey , we used to go down to the jersey beach a lot , and really enjoyed that a lot . 
they had , a really nice beach areas there . 
and i lived there for seven years . 
i see . 
and i really enjoyed that because the mountains were real close , 
that 's a really pretty area , too . 
we like the white mountains 
and unfortunately , i did n't really get to go skiing much while i was there . 
i went skiing once . 
we loved the new jersey area , too , because the lakes were really pretty close , 
not so much ? 
not really so much . 
i 'm sure . 
you have any children ? 
not yet . 
we had little children all the time , 
so some of the things are not quite as , adaptable . 
it 's a little more , difficult planning a vacation , when you have children . 
it is . 
you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy , too , 
especially for small children 
i know that one thing that happens to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family . 
we go wherever somebody is , that we have n't seen for a while . 
and so that was fun , 
and the summer we have a reunion in salt lake area up by park cities . where we 're going to camp for a week with as many members of a rather large reunion group as we can get together 
that sounds like a lot of fun . 
our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that , too , 
that there were several hundred people 
and they all kind of met at a central place . 
i did n't go , 
but it would have been a nice vacation . 
we 've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country . 
but maybe a pickup with the back on , 
i 've heard is really nice . 
so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes , 
but you would n't want to do it all the time . 
we have enough friends here and there , 
my dad has been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel and just picking up , 
he 's retired 
he 's in his sixties , 
and he would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there , and just not , be settled anywhere , 
just , see the rest of the country . 
he does that quite a bit . 
he has n't lately , though because he 's been ill , 
but he 's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time 
and he 'll say , this is my itinerary . 
i 'm going here , here and here 
and i 'll be back in about two months . 
that 's for sure . 
i have n't been much to the south , 
i guess those are the only states i have not visited . 
have you been to a lot of the different historical sites ? 
i believe it was . 
had about three kids then i think , 
but that was a really fun , interesting trip . 
and , so we were ready to look up the places we read about . 
it was really interesting . 
and then eventually , when we have kids , 
his folks did a lot of traveling across country . 
but , even some little ones do pretty good 
but when they get a little bigger they can help , 
that 's a fun way , to , cut costs 
and it 's enjoyable , too . 
as long as i have a shower nearby , i 'm fine . and electricity . 
i 'm with you . 
i need my creature comforts , too . 
it was great to talk to you . 
see you later . 
do you vote regular ? . 
i do , 
i try and vote in every single election . 
every one . 
but that 's just , in the past about six years . 
before that i really did n't pay any attention at all . 
that 's me . 
i 've never paid any attention to voting . 
you have n't ? 
i did n't use to , 
because i get so angry about what goes on 
unless you have something to do with it . 
but the problem is , that i am very liberal politically 
and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for . 
liberal , 
what do you mean by liberal . 
liberal politically , 
i do n't know anything about politics . 
you do n't ? 
there 's a lot of them , 
it depends on what issue you 're talking about . 
it 's kind of hard to say now , especially after desert storm , 
they were more for peace . 
and i 'm not sure how much that holds true anymore , 
usually . 
they want less government involvement , in society 
and so they 're less apt to vote in more aid to people , 
or more they 're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things . 
have you ever voted at all ? 
i never have . 
you have n't ? 
how old are you ? 
i do n't know that much about it . 
i do n't keep up on it 
and i do n't feel like i have enough knowledge on it to pick the right person . 
so that 's what they need , 
they said something to improve voting . 
if they could make it easier to find out what 's going on . 
do you know what i mean ? 
i think it was that woman , 
was n't it a woman . 
did n't he have a woman , 
there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while . 
that was a while ago , 
that was a couple elections ago , 
that 's okay . 
you do n't ? 
but they 're all saying that they 're going to do whatever is best for their campaign anyway . 
i do n't know , 
in school they did n't teach you about the government , not really . 
you did n't get any government classes ? 
it 's really hard too , 
what do you believe in , 
what do you believe in , 
they do n't take any stands on anything . 
they kind of say what do you want me to believe . 
or they word it so that it 's really hard to tell where they 're standing on certain issues . 
i know how they do it . 
with the abortion issues and stuff . 
they have to kind of take a stand on some things , like abortion and things like that , 
so that 's kind of , how i judge . 
there 's a few things where they have to say , like abortion or gun control , 
or let me see , 
but newspaper articles can show how they voted in the past 
also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway . 
and everybody 's got stuff they do n't want known . 
everybody 's got a secret . 
i 'm sorry i did n't have much knowledge . 
that 's okay . 
i do n't even remember this being on there . 
what would it take , 
this is really good actually , to talk to somebody who has n't voted , 
incentive ? 
what kind of stuff would you like them to do so that you would know more about it . 
send stuff in the mail or have it at the library 
i guess that would be good , 
i 'm sure they 've got it at the library . 
if i get to the library . 
i 've got two babies , 
do you ? 
that will tie you down a little bit . 
but i do n't know . 
or do you feel like it 's not really going to make that much difference if you do n't vote 
i know if enough people think like that it would make a difference , if people stopped thinking like that . 
a lot of people , they 'll vote the way their family votes , 
not in my family . 
we 're really independent . 
all split . 
but a lot of families do that . 
i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote . 
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved . 
i lie . . 
i do n't know , 
if i did understand politics i probably would vote more , 
not that i think he was good looking , 
but , he was young . 
and then , i did n't think that was right , because he may have been a good president , or whatever . 
what , 
he had an affair , 
and it just threw him out of the whole running . 
and a lot of people go by their personal life when they vote 
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life , you 're going to let it come into work 
i think everybody does , 
it just depends on how well you can hide it . 
that 's very true , 
criminal or something like that 's different , 
but otherwise . 
what effect does that have on him running for president . 
do you know what i mean ? 
it 's all so secretive , 
we really do n't see the true person anyway . 
that 's right . 
i think that 's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run , that the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that really do n't have anything to do with how well they do the job . 
but they 're trying to find an excuse not to deal with the issues that people really want to know about , because on those issues you have to say yes or no . 
and if they do n't say yes or no , then maybe somebody will vote for them that would n't have if they had come down on the wrong side . 
do you know what i 'm saying ? 
so they just try and make it a personal thing , 
that 's about what it looked like . 
i just thought he was really inept . 
i do n't think he did anything at all . 
they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet 
i think that was part of it , 
the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the recession and stuff , 
i thought he was great . 
did you ? 
i always liked him , 
i thought he was great at the time 
i just could n't believe that he got voted out . 
let 's see , 
that 's been about ten years ago ? 
and i liked him . 
you did ? 
have you heard stuff about him lately , 
do you know what he 's doing ? 
i sure do n't . 
he is really active still politically . 
he 's been overseas . 
actually quite a while . 
i 've lived here for six years 
and , can you hold on just a second ? . 
i 'm sorry 
i must have got the other line cut off . 
so , they 've been doing it for a while now 
i live in an apartment 
there it is , 
hold on . 
sorry about that . 
you 're okay , 
they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only . 
i 've been recycling for maybe about two years now and , at another public facility where they have recycling of glass aluminum and paper . 
have you recycled plastic also ? 
and that 's what i do n't understand exactly why they do n't have that option . 
we have out here 
up until just this last year there was n't any really good way , 
but not all that many , 
it was n't very well advertised 
but recently the refuse department is working on getting a system going where we will actually have a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things 
so it should be good , 
i just hate to think about it . 
where i work they also have recycling there of all white paper and of cans also 
i keep a little box at my desk , 
and as i 'm using the white paper i just throw it right in there , 
and then they have someone that comes around and pick it up every afternoon which is an excellent idea , at work because i know the amount they go through there 
that 's neat . 
that 's right . 
i guess one of the things that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about it , 
i would agree with that . 
i 've seen a few things but not very much , really 
and i think that 's a shame 
they need to do a little more , 
i 'd like to know , for instance , when they say plastic , all plastic , what kind of plastic , can you put all together 
or , is there some reason not to , 
maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they ca n't use , 
i do n't know 
but i 'd be glad to organize it , if they 'd tell me what it is i 'm doing because that would be really helpful . 
i agree with you there , 
their aluminum cans is for children 's hospital , for a burn fund 
that 's great . 
that gives , you a little bit of incentive there . 
and i would have them drop their cans off in my office 
saving them for you . 
and then i would haul them here to this place for the children 's hospital fund which got people really going into it , 
i think that 's , right . 
i think helping us be more enthusiastic about it , helping us maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt . 
there you go . 
making sure . 
that 's for sure . 
i think there needs to be a little bit more in the area of , advertisement , and letting you understand , more of what it is you 're doing , why you 're doing it , how it 's done and , what happens to it because i think that would help a lot . 
and i 'm sure in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more , 
i 'm glad , to see some of these things , i think . 
i think it is getting more advertisement . 
people are becoming more conscience all the time that it 's necessary to do , and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped , 
i think that 's true . 
that 's about my some on recycling 
but i enjoyed talking to you . 
i did too . 
do you have any pets now ? 
i sure do , 
and we just got a new addition to the family , 
we also have a fish . 
it 's a mud dog . 
it 's a mud dog . 
did you all catch it , 
the mud dog . 
did you catch the fish ? 
we had a friend give it to us . 
and it 's all alone in that aquarium . 
we 'd like to get him a friend 
but we have n't found one yet . 
so how about you , 
do you have any pets ? 
at the present time i have two dogs . 
what kind ? 
that 's the white dog with the feathers 
and it has yellow spots on it which they call liver spots . 
and that 's a male . 
and i have a wonderful female lab , black lab . 
how long have you had them . 
quite a long time probably five or six years 
and unfortunately the black lab that 's a female , it 's the most wonderful animal we 've ever had , 
and it 's in that breed . 
i do n't know , 
is that right ? 
i 'm not sure that 's the situation , 
for those dogs that are registered 
i had no idea , 
i did n't even know that . 
but she 's wonderful . 
what are the symptoms ? 
he 's got a bad back 
but he 's seven , 
i guess he 's almost eight years old . 
he does n't like to roll over . 
but otherwise , he can jump just as long as he does n't bend a certain way . 
. i have had just wonderful luck with this lab , 
let 's see , 
winter before last we would bring her in when it was cold . 
the next morning you want to take them out , 
i bet . 
my son 's college roommate , is a vet 
and he said let 's give her some race horse shots . 
i 'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this , because you all the time run into people with problems . 
so he gave this dog a series of , 
and it 's called . 
anyway , it 's a series of six shots , once a week , 
do you have to give those ? 
i could have , 
but i ca n't give a shot . 
believe me , 
i understand . 
and after the second shot she was significantly better . 
then i did n't notice any improvement till after the sixth one . 
but not many people in this part of the country know anything about . 
they 've heard about it 
but they 've really never used it . 
i 've never heard anything about it either . 
and it 's just wonderful . 
is he an inside dog also , 
or does he just run out in the backyard ? 
we 're living now in an area where we 're in the woods 
and we take walks . 
i just do n't let them go away from me , 
but we take walks through the woods twice a day . 
that 's nice . 
and i can over do it on her . 
but anyway , at least she can go 
tell me about your cat . 
and we took him in 
and he 's about two years old now 
and he loves his treats , 
and let 's see , 
he 's outside 
and he 's got a way to get in , 
he 's got free access of a window we like to keep open . 
so , he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to . 
of course . 
that 's nice , 
he has to go out whenever we ask him 
and he 'll tell you which one he wants . 
he 's been through obedience school . 
he has been trained 
and you 've kept it up , have n't you . 
it is wonderful , 
i have some neighbors across the field , 
i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while . 
so i kept watch and never let them get away , 
but now every couple weeks , one would slip away 
and my neighbor said to me , i noticed those dogs are so well trained , 
anytime they hear your voice , they come . 
so that made me very proud . 
have we been talking five minutes ? 
i 'm not for sure . 
i 'm not either , 
i think maybe we have , 
it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure . 
have you ever done this before ? 
i have n't ever called . 
i 've put in the paper work , 
i just never made the call . 
i did n't know if they stop you when the time is up 
they do n't , 
i glanced at the clock when we started 
and i think it 's been probably about five and a half minutes or something . 
but one day i was talking to a lady about gardening 
and i love gardening 
and she did too , 
and , after about twelve minutes or something , the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape . 
at least you know you did your part . 
but it 's been so much fun too talk . 
how did you get into this . 
i see . 
and so she knew that i had the time and would enjoy it . 
that 's true . 
do you work . 
i do . 
and probably just got home . 
and i understand also they want men . 
i was going to tell you the same thing . 
they 're really looking for a lot more men to participate . 
my husband does . 
does he . 
i 've got some applications , 
i need to hand them out . 
but this is a great project , that they 're working on 
and it 's really going to lead the way for a lot of applications and development in the voice area . 
i think so too , 
and i have n't helped them out on men particularly , 
but my husband probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time , 
i try to make them during the day , 
but nobody 's home . 
this is the perfect time for me . 
maybe i 'll get you next time . 
it so much fun to talk to you . 
have a good one . 
you too , 
do you use credit cards ? 
not very often . 
the ones we use is visa 
and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month . 
so it does n't get the credit , 
if you 're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy do n't you ? . 
otherwise , you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it 's not a very good idea . 
that 's right . 
do you have a lot of credit cards ? 
i have a lot of them 
but i do n't use them very much , though . 
i use them mostly for big things , like maybe , sometimes tuition if i 'm short , to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can . 
just goes on and on . 
which is what they want . 
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think , i can just charge it , 
but really if they do n't have the money then , they are n't going to have it in a month , 
that 's true . 
they make the mistake of , pushing all their cards . 
there are times , when it 's very useful , like emergency trip , or something . 
the money will be available , 
but it 's not immediately handy . 
i think they 're very helpful , 
plus the fact that it 's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes . 
but you really do need to be very responsible about it 
or you end up in deep trouble . 
i made that mistake when i first got a job 
it took me quite a while to pay them off , 
so after that i decided , i 'm not going to use them at all , and just try to pay cash for everything 
and that worked for a while 
and then we got married 
so we decided if we used them we would pay them off as we go . 
that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances . 
the other thing about them is too , you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them , and have n't developed a credit thing . it stops you from doing a lot of things . 
that 's true , 
so they have become a very vital part of our monetary system , over the last few years . 
but it 's true , 
you have to be very careful 
or you end up going in the deep end 
and an awful lot of people are in trouble . 
and he makes calls to people who have problems credit problems , that are trying to work out 
and . poor thing he comes home very depressed every night , because the world has so many problems of that sort , 
it 's a really big problem and takes mature people to treat it , 
so that it 's a real advantage to you , instead of a disadvantage . 
i think the way the tax system was , they encouraged people to use credit cards with a big write off at the end of the year . 
it did n't do you any good now , does it ? 
you can not write off your interest . 
even before it probably was n't , though , because you did n't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying . 
other than that , i do n't have too much on credit cards 
it 's good to talk to you . 
you , too . 
for calling . 
now . 
do you exercise regularly . 
i sure do . 
what do you do ? 
i ride a bicycle quite a bit and work out with free weights . 
i love to ride a bicycle . 
i live right near white rock lake , 
so i try to ride , about ten to twenty miles a day . 
but , i have n't been doing so well this year , 
that 's good . 
last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while 
and when i 'd gotten back i had gotten some sun that day , 
it was the sweating , not the burn 
that 's weird . 
that was wild . 
but , i do n't exercise now , 
i just had a baby three months ago , 
i have n't really gotten back into exercising . 
but i exercised real good for a couple of years . 
it was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week 
and it was running three nights a week . 
what 's your motivation ? 
what 's my motivation ? 
a friend of mine , always pushing me . 
and she would push , 
she was , let 's go do it , 
and she would n't take for an answer . 
was it for health , or , to look good ? 
i just wanted to look good , 
it was n't really health related . 
it was just a side benefit . 
because i 'm not big or anything , 
but i 'm not in great shape , 
but when i worked out , i got in pretty good shape . 
i did n't build up muscle , though , 
i just got real good and toned . 
i do n't think women look good with muscles . 
up to a point . 
up to a point , 
what was the other question , 
let 's see , 
do you do it as a task 
or do you enjoy working out . 
i think i enjoy it sometimes 
and there 's other times when i just get tired of it 
and i feel like i 'm obligated to do it , because i 've been doing it 
so i should keep up . 
you do n't want to lose yourself . 
and there 's some days it 's the hardest thing in the world to get started . 
how old are you ? 
so you 're still young . 
still young , 
getting older . 
we all are , 
if you keep working out when you 're young though , when you get older your body 's not going to look as bad . 
i seen an old woman today , 
and she looked so good , 
she was standing just as straight and tall 
she did n't have that at all . 
her lips were a little bit wide , 
back in her time , they liked women with big hips anyway 
so she may be keeping that on purpose , 
i notice if you stay in shape you do n't age as bad , 
i go to school , too , at night 
those kind of things age you more . 
smoking ages you quick , 
and then it just kind of feeds itself . 
you smoke , 
i smoke a pack a day 
i finally quit because all i was doing was going down hill fast . 
i ca n't quit smoking , 
i 've tried . 
i was telling a friend of mine that i 'd be almost as bad as being an alcoholic , 
i ca n't quit smoking . 
i 've tried , 
i just ca n't do it . 
i quit when i was pregnant with my kids , 
but as soon as i had them , right back to it . 
right back to them . 
that was the only reason i quit . 
i did n't want to . 
and i do n't want to quit smoking , 
i enjoy that . 
i said i have very few vices , 
i 'll keep this one 
thank you . 
but did you ever go to one of those health clubs or anything ? 
i went to health club a few years ago , 
and now i work out at home , because my schedule with school and work , i do n't have time to get down to one . 
but i actually prefer to work out alone . 
i like to work out with people , 
i need competition , is what i need . 
i 've got to have somebody to compete with , 
or i do n't want to do anything . 
i would n't mind working out with a friend and stuff 
but when you get into some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait . 
i like to start , get it done and get out of there . 
are you married or anything ? 
get your girlfriend to work out with you . 
a lot of women like that . 
i 'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him . 
he does n't work out very often . 
course , he do n't need to . 
he 's small 
and he works as a laborer on the railroad . 
so he 's building his muscles up all day , 
he does n't have to do anything . 
he can eat like a horse , too . 
and he do n't gain it like i do . 
you have to . 
you can gain too much weight . 
i gained a little bit too much , 
with my first little boy , i did gain a lot of weight , 
and i did n't loose it until two years ago 
and then i got pregnant and ruined that , 
just have to start all over . 
actually , like i say , it ai n't as bad this time , because i was in shape when i got pregnant . 
i was n't overweight when i got pregnant with him , 
i just was n't in shape . 
i do n't know the difference 
about weight ? 
and about , working out and fitness , 
exercise . 
i like to work out to look good and stay in shape 
and i know it 's good for me , 
that 's what my friend did . 
developing and everything . 
what is it ? 
steroids . 
steroids , 
there 's really bad for you . 
i was trying to say hemorrhoids , , 
i was trying to say hormones . 
hormones . 
hormones , 
steroids . 
but , i stay from that crap . 
it 's too dangerous . 
i could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something . 
i had a friend whose brother did steroids 
and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out . 
it all turned to fat 
and he just , really looked bad . 
i did n't know it did that . 
i do n't know if it does to everybody , 
just that 's how it affected him . 
but i 've been wanting to get me a bike . 
i 've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around . 
i 'm scared to run , for dogs . 
course i know dogs can get you on a bike too , 
at least you got a chance to out run them that way . 
i do n't like to run myself . 
i 've thought about it several times 
and i like to move a little faster and cover more ground . 
they 've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was . 
i would think it would be hard on your legs and your joints and stuff . 
it 's real hard on your legs 
and it 's hard on women . 
and it just makes stuff move down . 
but i like jogging , 
i do n't mind that . 
i can get out and do that , as long as it 's not hot . 
if it 's hot , you ca n't do that . 
but i love to run in the rain , 
just be careful not to slide . 
but you ca n't ride your bike at all in the rain , can you . 
you ca n't , 
it 's dangerous . 
you slide . 
at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could 
when i did ride my friend 's bike , that one time i do n't know what i was trying to do . 
i can do it in my car , 
but i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked 
and i told her a dog was chasing me . 
but i wrecked it into the curb . 
i did n't hurt it too bad . 
she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire , i think . 
but . 
anyway , it 's been nice talking to you . 
good luck with the new kid . 
thank you , 
she 's good . 
anyway , have fun exercising . 
what kind of painting are you planning to do ? 
and it 's a rent house 
so i decided i 'm going to paint . 
and i 've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint . 
what would be interesting . 
i 've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments , 
but they look very interesting 
and you get some beautiful effects with them . 
what i 'm trying to do is i 've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms 
so i want something that 's going to tie that together 
i 'm going to put wood in there . 
that should be nice . 
so it 's going to have kind of a country look . 
and i have n't even decided as far as what kind of paint to buy . 
i do n't have an actual instruction book 
so i 'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now . 
it 's going to be a big experiment . 
i was about to say , you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing . 
because you might find that it 's beyond what you 're willing to put into it . although i think it could turn out really nice . 
i have n't ever done fancy painting 
but i sure did my share of just regular painting . 
i 've painted several houses , inside . 
i , never painted the outside . 
inside . 
what kind of paint do you normally use ? 
my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers 
only one of our bathroom has a window in it 
so i 'm hoping that it wo n't be too much of a problem . 
i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it . 
i 'm planning on taking it off . 
and it took forever . 
i would not recommend that method . 
if it 's really old , you do n't know what it 's put on with . 
it 's hard to tell , 
so it may be the original wallpaper . 
could be , 
if it 's vinyl it should be easier to strip too . 
if it 's paper it will probably shred . 
in one bathroom it 's probably paper , 
it 's silver and yellow , and white . 
the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black , 
this was in a bathroom too . 
and the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background 
that 's kind of an odd color for a bathroom . 
it was awful , 
it was absolutely hideous 
and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it 
and a guest went in there 
and i 'm not really quite sure , 
i do n't know if maybe i 'm biting off more than i can chew . 
i 'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes 
and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale . 
the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting . 
it would n't be any kind of special effects type thing . 
it would be just plain paint . 
it 's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time . 
and it can be done a whole lot faster . 
you can wash up easily because they 're water soluble . 
and they dry fast 
so you really do n't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend . if you have some help . 
if you leave it on for weeks , it will do that . 
if you take it up the next day it should be fine . 
you want it to get dry , but not just real hard . 
that 's the problem . 
it will come up a lot easier if you do n't wait too long . 
and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work . 
but use good stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands , that will go down and come up easily . 
i really appreciate all the helpful tips , 
i think you just made my project a lot easier . 
i wish you very good luck with it 
and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business . 
the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets 
and i decided that was too much to tackle , 
i 'd hire a professional . 
if you were closer i 'd tell you you could come over and supervise . 
if i were closer i might . 
i hope your project turns out great 
we 'll see how it goes , 
i may just be flat painting over it . 
of course that 's the other advantage of paint . 
if you do n't like it all you do is put on another coat . 
i guess we 'd better go because our time looks like it 's about up . 
i need to go to the dentist , 
thank you . 
i think i get most of my news in headlines from the radio , 
i do about the same but in a different fashion . 
now that it has a national edition , i read that . 
i like them 
but they take so long . 
i do n't always have time . 
it 's a whole hour show . 
actually , it 's an hour show each evening , 
and , we turn it on when we start dinner . 
we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up . 
i travel a great deal even overseas , 
and , i 'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out . 
i do n't believe everything they say , 
but it 's coverage . 
i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad , until the gulf war . 
and they seemed to have the best coverage . 
they had more information sooner than , most of the other networks . 
i think he reported what he saw 
and if you did n't like it , that was just too bad . 
but i think they said that frequently enough . that you should n't criticize the man for giving us one perspective . 
. 
that 's right , 
i think so . 
and i guess when it comes to magazines , i do n't read , 
i used to when i was younger , 
i have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper 
or , i also subscribe to something called world press , which is a magazine that only talks about other , excerpts from the world press , 
but that and the radio . 
northern . 
i 'm from the peninsula , 
what is that , 
it 's horrible . 
and that 's a terrible paper . 
is that pretty good ? 
what is that , 
the chronicle is n't it ? 
there 's the chronicle , and the examiner , 
they really are probably the worse papers i 've ever read . 
can you get the l a paper up there ? 
that 's a pretty decent paper is n't it 
we can , 
but i do n't like it . 
that 's another one i read , 
i forgot that . 
i read the wall street journal , 
not as in depth as i used to , because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer 
again , i read that two columns on the front . 
i agree with you that the problem seems to be they do n't have enough time to do all the stuff . 
i spend a lot of time reading about these things . 
i 'm quite interested . 
i find it very exciting for the coverage we have now , today . 
and i think we do get pretty good coverage . 
we almost have too much . 
i do n't know , 
i did n't know that . 
and i would not watch that man for money . 
how do you feel about it ? 
i do n't know 
if it said that . i feel i 'm well enough equipped . 
do we get enough news or something like that ? 
do we get the news that we want ? 
and i do . 
i think i do too . 
i think you got to segregate some of it . 
that 's about all i have to say . 
nice to talk to you . 
nice talking to you . 
what movies do you like ? 
i like just about anything . 
my little boy 's four 
and he loves them . 
we do n't have any kids 
but we like them anyway . 
that 's okay . 
how old are you all ? 
we 're late twenties . 
and you just do n't have any yet , 
i 've got two . 
my little girl is three months old 
and my little boy just turned four . 
i had his birthday party yesterday . 
but he 's a turtle fanatic . 
he even had turtle cake yesterday . 
but i 've been wanting to see turtle two . 
is it as good as they say it is ? 
it was , 
it was actually better than the first one , i thought . 
what 's the last movie you saw ? 
ghost . 
when the topic came up , i was asking my husband right quick , what 's the last movies we saw . 
i really liked it . 
ghost , 
but it was good movie , 
not too awful bad . 
because that was just so good . 
did you see pretty woman ? 
but i 've been hearing a lot about it . 
we do n't get to the video store very often 
and we do n't have cable . 
we do n't really want cable , 
so we get two channels down here . 
and we used to get five channels without cable . 
i do n't think you all have the same channels , 
once in a while , when i 'm home . 
you work then ? 
we get the channel with young and the restless on it . 
and then i think general hospital 
and that comes on different channel . 
it does . 
but that 's all we get , 
and that 's no cartoons for my little boy . 
and my husband is a movie fanatic . 
i think you would really like pretty woman , 
it made you feel really good . 
it was just a happy movie . 
what about total recall , 
have you seen that . 
i saw that one . 
that 's good . 
i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was . 
it was violent . 
i try to get away from that . 
have you seen it ? 
the part where they 're shooting mercy . 
i do n't like that . 
that 's horrible , 
that is horrible 
i do n't see why they have to do that , 
everybody knows that the language is there so they could just ignore it and use different words instead , i think . 
i know . 
but i think lately pretty woman 's been my favorite . 
i went and bought the video . 
my husband bought me pretty in pink for my birthday . 
wait a second , 
that 's okay . 
he bought me pretty in pink . 
just a second . 
you 're glad you ai n't got a four year old . 
that 's okay . 
i have n't seen pretty in pink , 
this is the first time he 's interrupted my phone calls . 
it was cute , 
that was so good . 
and i loved it . 
i have n't seen it either . 
if you like love stories , it 's sweet . 
i do . 
it 's sweet , 
it really is . 
it gets you , 
it makes you feel really sorry for her . 
but it 's hilarious too , especially with that little guy in it . 
he looks like a little boy next door , 
it 's a cute movie . 
i ca n't remember his name . 
i do n't know . 
do n't know either . 
probably know him if i saw him . 
if i could remember the name , i know you 'd know his name , because he 's played in a few movies . 
i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was sleeping with the enemy . 
i 've heard about that 
but i ca n't remember it . 
you know pretty woman was kind of a light comedy and a romance , 
and this one was a lot more dramatic . 
was n't it a murder mystery ? 
sort of . 
it was a mystery . 
that 's the one i wanted to see where she was at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something . 
it came out in the theater . 
and i think around here , it 's all ready quit playing . 
but i do n't know if it 's still playing any where else . 
i think , 
but it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat . 
real good . 
i want to see that . 
but it 's just been down here a couple weeks , i think . 
because we saw it , probably , four or five months ago . 
i know it has n't been that long since i 've seen the previews for it , 
but 
i wanted to see it . 
it was scary . 
i 'd like to see that . 
i want to see war of the roses too , 
have you seen that ? 
i did n't like it . 
you did n't ? 
i did n't like the way it ended . 
i know , 
i ca n't believe they killed them . 
or who was it 
so i know that they die , 
but i have n't told my husband . 
we 've both been wanting to see it . 
it was weird . 
it was a different movie from anything i 've ever seen . 
they did that did n't they 
and they marked off routes that they could go or something . 
that would be kind of hard for us , 
we 've only got one bathroom , 
we 've got two bathrooms 
my house kind of looks like two trailers put together . 
and one bathroom is at the end of one side 
and one 's in the middle of the other , 
so we could do it . 
that would n't be too bad . 
and he could climb out the window . 
every room leads to three rooms , 
get around . 
you can get around . 
you just ca n't go out the front door honey , 
did you see fatal attraction ? 
that 's coming back , on too . 
and that 's kind of in a way how it kind of bothered you , the way it ended and stuff . 
that 's kind of how war of the roses was . 
parts of war of the roses was funny 
but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious , 
and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling . 
eerie feeling , 
or , i want to see it though . 
i 've heard about that 
i wanted to see that . 
but i do n't know what it 's about . 
the never ending story ? 
it 's a child 's movie , 
but it 's good , 
i enjoyed it . 
i do too 
and 
they 're some of the best that are made . 
i think he 's up in a attic , or some part of school . 
he got locked in the school 
and he got scared , 
but he starts dreaming 
it 's been so long since i 've seen it . 
it flies through the air . 
and he 's trying to save the land from some , ooze . 
but it 's really good , 
i do n't think so . 
i did n't see that . 
you did n't see that , 
that was cute , 
that was a good one . 
so do i 
and a lot of times we 'll go to rent a movie or something 
and you 're not sure whether it will be any good or not 
a friend of mine told me she got naked gun last night 
and she said that was hilarious . 
we saw that , 
and they 're coming out with a sequel to it . 
two and a half . 
it was funny . 
i want to see that . 
she said she rented it last night and said it was real good 
and working girl is really good . 
i seen that , 
that was good . 
was that with that blonde , 
i rented that one night by myself . 
i was home alone . 
did you see home alone ? . 
i did , 
that just reminded me of that . 
did you like it ? 
so , i 'm just a little bit different than typical , 
so everything around here is set up that way . which i think is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way they 're constructed . 
and it 's a brick house , with some wood . 
it 's real nice , 
i like it . 
how about you ? 
i certainly hope so . 
ranch style home , 
i would hate to think that anybody thought the lot we live on as a ranch . 
it started out life as a three bedroom house , and now has no two car garage and has the two extra rooms enclosed . 
are most of the houses in your area three bedroom , two bath ? 
almost a hundred percent . 
ours is probably the closest to it . 
if you had two people that do n't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house , 
do n't need a closet . 
when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are identical to mine 
because it 's all different builders up here . 
so it 's kind of hard at that point to classify some of the builders . 
but the one thing , my house is a little bit different 
and i can pick it out again because it 's not typical , 
what do you call a double ceiling , double high in one half of the house . 
and the kitchen is norm 
so it just goes down the dining room , the family room , and the living room that way . 
and i love the space . 
and i just lucked out and walked into this one 
but , again , it 's not typical in this area . 
you can just spot them because the roof is so much higher . 
i had n't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs . 
and those are pleasant . 
he can walk 
and he 's six foot . 
and he says , come on up mom . 
i 'm not going up there . 
i 'm not going up there , 
but he says there 's plenty of room up there for a room . 
so that means if i knock out the wall in my family room , i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem . 
but i 'm not that ambitious . 
maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and get angry i 'll start poking holes up there , 
i guess probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick with some wood . 
but it 's basically all brick . 
and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine . 
but the one on they 're total brick 
and they 're basically almost all three , two . 
they 're all three , two . 
but of course they have a little river going down their area too , which is kind of nice . 
if it 's the kind of river i 'm thinking of , better than us . 
they 've put little fountains in and such . 
that 's nice . 
and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains 
and they did n't pay any attention to banks and that kind of stuff . 
so you 're just as likely to wake up and discover you 're in two inches of water . 
it 's a third of an acre . 
i do n't think that 's a lot , 
in fact , i have been real disappointed in the six years that i 've lived out here about lot sizes . 
i 'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have . 
when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost there 's no lot line at all . 
they 're built practically on top of each other . 
that 's true . 
i know , 
and while there are some advantages to that , there 's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things . 
it 's not as comfortable a living for me . 
there 's enough to put twelve feet between each house on each side . 
i 've got more on one side than i 've got on the other , 
but i 'm like you , 
here , i look out my back yard 
and i can see the gate . 
the fence is right there , 
just do n't run too fast , 
or you 'll hit it 
and i 'm not used to that either . 
i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me , 
but to me , you put the swimming pool in your back yard 
and you 've lost your back yard . 
you 've got a little place on one side or the other , 
but to me they 're not that big enough for a pool , 
but they 're going up , 
from that aspect , you 're right . 
and it does n't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff . 
but 
i 'm used to walking out the back yard 
and you can play catch across the back yard 
and you 've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball , 
but , do n't do it around here . 
i started looking 
and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city . 
i had n't thought about it that way . 
but , we went that way . 
it was the schools and the cost of houses , 
so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic , time to get into work , 
and that 's where we stopped . 
it was the same problem . 
you all both work downtown ? 
this is a wonderful thing that you 're doing here still helping them out . 
but you were working downtown . 
so i have no problems . 
but as far as the housing , personally , i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller . 
do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there ? 
we 've got quite a few , actually . 
what we 're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city . 
and it 's just surrounding the city , 
and you can actually see it . 
they 're blurred , 
they 're even dark , 
and what it is is the pollution . 
what do you think of the greenhouse effect that 's going on ? 
that 's causing the hole in the ozone . 
that 's very serious . 
we 're even feeling the effects of the weather from the shift in the jet stream . 
it is scary though , is n't it ? 
the last two years , our winters have been absolutely nothing . 
maybe , one snow . 
i should know 
but , i do n't , 
i 'm sorry . 
and we 'd have three and four feet of snow . 
they do n't know what snow is . 
that 's close to here . 
real close . 
how old are you ? 
twenty seven . 
i almost forgot my age . 
we 're the same age . 
i forget my age all the time , 
so that 's okay . 
i think it 's just something that goes with the territory . 
i just laugh . 
i do , 
and traffic slows down to nothing . 
actually , they 've been doing the same thing here . 
it 's kind of funny , 
i 'm from the north , 
i do n't know , 
you just get used to the weather , 
and of course the people down in south , they 're not used to cold weather and stuff , 
i do n't know , 
i just laugh 
every time they have snow , on the ground everything 's closed up . 
and you can have snow on the ground . 
that 's true . 
do you all have much pollution there ? 
not really , 
not to see it . 
and there is a few factories , 
but i do n't see much pollution going on . 
what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road , 
and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe . 
they have a test , or something like that . 
and that 's supposed to cut down on it . 
supposedly that 's supposed to catch it . 
but i 'll tell you what , 
and even these buses it . 
school buses and the commercial buses , 
school buses are notorious . 
they 're burning that diesel fuel is what it is . 
and it gets bad . 
you know what they 've started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they 've started putting them up at the top , 
and that way it gets above other cars on the road 
that 's a good idea . 
and it really does make a difference , 
although it settles , 
even if it 's at the top and it 's a lot of black smoke coming out , it still settles , 
and , if you 're going to be jogging on the side of the road , that 's even more miserable . 
the pregnant women are n't supposed to walk along a highway because of that smoke fumes . 
i did n't know that . 
when i was pregnant with my first little boy , i had read it , 
because i was walking back and forth , 
not back and forth , 
and i was having to walk along the highway . 
it was just one day a week . 
i have no sense of smell , 
so i could n't smell this , 
but it would make me sick , 
and i 'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway . 
that 's bad . 
all the exhaust . 
that was four years ago , too , 
it 's probably a lot worse now . 
i 'm sure . 
you can really feel it in your breathing , even normal people , 
and it 'll pass out , 
and it 's killed several people . 
do you smoke ? 
it was kind of funny . 
and they were just screening some candidates , 
and i do n't think i 'd ever do that , 
i was just one of those 
because you do smoke one a day . 
in between people . 
so that kind of threw them off . 
for the air pollution . 
for ozone , and all that . 
they 're real big into it . 
and they 're just doing a lot of stuff . 
i do n't hear much about it down here . 
but , too , we 've got that air coming in off the coast . 
and it 'd blow it up north . 
so , maybe that 's part of the reason it 's not so bad down here . 
but 
i ca n't believe they have warnings here , which it 's mainly just when it gets real , real hot . 
that 's kind of good to know , 
i think they do that for most everybody . 
especially , it 's usually for the young children and older old people . 
it 's a big change . 
it is ? 
and here they 've got the mountains , the beach , the trees , 
they 've got streams , rivers , ponds , 
it 's really pretty here . 
is it ? 
in a lot of parts , 
they do ? 
they live close then . 
real close . 
i go there , 
you go where ? 
you go to visit them ? 
they 've got trees , 
i 'm going to have to get some . 
i had one . 
my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago . 
do you smoke ? 
i do . 
do you ? 
i do . 
did you smoke when you were pregnant ? 
i did . 
i could n't make myself quit . 
i did cut down a lot . 
i can understand that , actually . 
i 've got one vice 
and smoking is it . 
i do n't drink , 
and i do very little , 
i miss their morals , their values and everything . 
we 're down here at the bible belt , are n't we ? 
i was n't saved until i got down here , 
how 'd you get involved in this research ? 
and he got me into it . 
i see . 
how 'd you get into it ? 
and so they told me about this project . 
it 's fun , 
i like talking to new people . 
and a couple of times i 've been interrupted by my little girl , 
i 've had to hang up and stuff . 
but i enjoy it . 
from up north , like you said , 
i do , 
my husband was in the service , 
and his family 's down here . 
we 're out of the service now . 
i bet you 're glad . 
you are . 
i have two children , 
i have a seven year old and a three year old . 
so i try to spend as much time as possible with them . 
that 's good . 
what kind of things do you do ? 
we do a lot of things with them , 
or my oldest is in school 
and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that . 
was it a big change in your life , to have a child . 
it 's really nice , 
my husband is working most of the time . 
he 's working long hours , 
but i 'm staying home . 
i 'm just working a couple days a month , 
what do you do during those days ? 
we spend a lot of time at the playground 
and we go to the zoo , 
you said you worked a couple days a month , though , 
what do you do ? 
i 'm a nurse . 
are you ? 
he 's , just now really starting to get interested in a lot of things , 
i understand that , 
they really grow up quick . especially at that early age . 
she worked part-time when my oldest was little 
and now she 's staying home all the time , 
but that worked out really well because it 's a big transition to have children . 
to go from nothing , 
if you want to do something every night that 's fine , 
but when you have children it does n't work that way anymore , 
that 's right , 
and i think a lot of people are realizing that 
but still there are so many people that have their careers first 
and i think it 's really hurting the kids , 
i agree with you , 
i think that my wife leaned that way 
and i 'm really glad she did 
and i 'm glad she 's staying home , 
but i know there are some days when she wishes she was back at work . 
i know , . 
that 's why i like to work a couple days , 
i think it gives me a break . 
that 's why i 'm glad my wife did too , 
and that got her out of the house 
most of the time at home , 
we had started out like that 
and i think that was really ideal . 
i do to , 
i agree , 
but then when you start having two of them , it 's a little bit tougher , because you 've got to make a little more money , to make that payoff and stuff . 
it 's difficult , 
i 've lived here forever , 
where are you from ? 
i 've lived here eight years or so , 
that explains it does n't it . 
i do n't know , 
we do a lot of things on the weekends together , the family , 
but as far as during the week , it 's usually just my son and i , 
what 's your husband do ? 
he works for coca cola . 
he manages a plant out here , 
and it takes a lot of time . 
i 'm sure it does . 
we take walks , and go to the library , and try to fill our day with things like that , 
i 'm perfectly capable of doing it for them , 
but , it 's so much easier to go to mom , 
i guess they get used to it . 
but we 'd go to the library and do things like that , 
that 's good , 
that 's good . 
and he works about an hour and a half away from our home , 
so it takes him a little bit of time . 
and i 'm not able to work during the week because of that . 
i was working in the evening , 
and he was coming home 
and i could go to work , 
just the time that they were spending together , 
i think it really helped to have that time together . 
it really does 
because i think you grow closer . 
had he been around children , 
he has seven other brothers and sisters , 
so there 's a lot of kids in the family 
and he really enjoys it . 
but right now it 's kind of a difficult time , 
and the cost of living here is just so tremendously outrageous . 
it 's difficult to do it any other way . 
i understand . 
then you 're not getting to spend as much time at home , 
your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he 'd want to . 
that 's right . 
that 's a tough situation , 
you got to do what you got to do to get along , too , 
at least , i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home . 
like i said my wife normally feels that way , 
there are days when i come home 
and she says take these kids , 
i 'm getting out . 
i know . 
so she 's had about enough during those days , 
i know . 
like what you said with the cost of living and everything , i think a lot of people ca n't afford to get by on just one salary and wo n't . 
and so i think that 's tended to lead to a decline in families and family values especially . 
it has . 
and i really think that that 's one of the problems the nation 's facing that we need to do something about , 
but i do n't know what . 
i believe that too , 
they need to really focus on the children in this country . 
would you have said that a couple of years ago ? 
i did n't even really think about it that much , 
i was vaguely aware of it , 
but it was n't really that important to me , 
it 's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you 've had a child . 
it really does , 
seeing how you really are forming the mind . 
in the next year or so , you 'll see so many instances where he 'll mimic something that you 've done , 
and everything i 'm doing , he 's learning from . 
that 's right . 
that 's how they 're developing their patterns . 
and i think a lot of people either , do n't care , or do n't realize it . 
or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide . 
eventually . 
it 's true . 
i know , 
plus i think it becomes part of you too , 
you get to stay home , 
it 's not just for him , 
but it 's also for you , because you 're both kind of bonding together there too , i think , 
that 's true . 
it 's been nice talking to you . 
it 's nice talking to you , too . 
good luck . 
i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject , 
so i 'll tell you , 
is it a serious problem ? 
i do believe it 's a serious problem . 
however , there are solutions to it . 
if a third of the people are shift workers , they wo n't be able to get to the polls in any case . if they have to work late into the evening and not get up . 
they hold it on the weekends ? 
but that is one of my solutions . 
and i do not think they have seen a really high improvement . 
i always vote . 
and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot . 
i do not say that it is that complicated , 
so registrations are perhaps a problem also . 
and we 're the mobile society , 
one out of every seven people moves every year . 
but i do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place , who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard . 
i think that is the biggest one . 
that 's the biggest problem . 
i , just read two books , 
one of them is whose stars and stripes now ? 
it 's a fairly decent book . 
it 's preceded by several other books by these guys . 
and i forget what the other books were , 
in any case , they say that there 's a definite trend toward candidates using negative voting . 
it is the only way that you can use television effectively . 
i do n't understand that . 
is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public ? 
the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than a positive factor . 
if you go on the attack , and put some sensational thing before the public and it is not refuted , people will believe it . 
if you do n't refute it , as he did n't , there must be some truth to the matter . 
he did refute it . 
he refuted it , 
he did n't believe anybody would believe that . 
and indeed his trend started upward . 
i did n't believe anybody would believe that either . 
they do . 
then how can a democracy work then ? 
i do n't know . 
how can it work ? 
is it working ? 
that 's the question . 
everybody seems disappointed , 
my solution to part of this is to make it an economic incentive for people to vote . 
what ? 
you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever . 
how about the reverse of that ? 
what if we just severely limited the campaigns so money was n't so much of an issue ? 
i feel like , , if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count . 
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls , 
, i do n't care how easy it is for them , 
i do not think they are going to because they do no think that anybody listens to their vote . 
and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance . 
you mean the special interest groups ? 
they do not promise anything specific these days . 
but whatever you are promised , they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office . 
read my lips . 
and no new taxes 
but he 's excused from that . 
i 've read polls now where they 've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget . 
then why did he say that during his campaign ? 
he promised the best he could . 
and he is the president 
and he should address those problems 
what was so funny about it is that it happened so rapidly . 
he knew it . 
he actually knew it . 
and being associated with government , he should be held up to the light for that . 
and maybe he will . 
and he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that . 
i think voters are motivated ... 
what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about ? 
because it 's going to be totally different , 
you do not think so ? 
just , it got more violent every year . 
but , simply because people were so concerned about their inability that their vote does not count any way . 
now everybody is available . 
i see , 
were disqualified . 
or is that just the truth ? 
i think there 's a higher percentage in certain black areas of voters . 
i think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction . 
they have this huge fight going over redistricting here . 
and at one point they took another vote on it , 
and the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to pass their plan . 
and this is something that had been going on for months . 
it was on the news every night . 
and they have had lawsuits over it . 
it was a major issue , 
and there still was n't enough minority vote to pass the plan that they were backing . 
i think that you have really hit on something there . 
what do you mean ? 
why , 
did you not press one ? 
i did press one , 
but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up . 
i should not say i do not know . 
i do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed . 
and when difficult decisions are made they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on . 
i know in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code a unanimous verdict is not required . 
and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people , 
they are down to as small as six people in minor felonies and misdemeanor trials . 
but is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world ? 
if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences , 
i think that is what is happening . 
i think the judges are trying to save the people from having , the cost of new prisons . 
that might be it . 
they are saying , the people can not afford it . 
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions prevail . 
plus , i guess , there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial . 
so 
you might be right about that . 
i do not know , 
it just seems to me that only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway . 
in the very end 
or less than half the cases that go to trial end up with the jury actually making the verdict . 
with a conviction ? 
that most of it is plea bargained half way through 
or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway . 
but how do you feel about the jury system itself ? 
do you think that should be changed ? 
i know one of my friends was brought up for jury duty . 
most of it was robberies or things like that , 
it was not any serious crimes . 
so apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person any felony . 
they give the person the option for a jury . 
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with the jury . 
but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in any sort of a case where damages are the result of some sort of an action that you are bringing against someone else . you can ask for that to be heard before a jury . 
takes a heck of a long time to get there in some states . 
i do not know , 
it is faced with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system . 
because everywhere i read that there is a shortage of judges . 
not that they wo n't appoint them 
but there is no budget for them , i guess . 
and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the court clerks . 
whatever . 
i do not think i would change it . 
i do not know what we would replace it with . 
i do not think i would either . 
i know , 
i can not think of the word i am looking for . 
anyway , the deterrent . for people to not commit the crime is sort of gone away . 
i do not know , 
they just do not care any more . 
and yet there are so many people in prison . 
my impression of it is that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty . 
i mean it , 
i guess our population has grown some too . 
but there definitely is to me one of the worst things that could ever happen from what i read and see and understand . 
i do no think i could handle prison . 
it would be very difficult , 
i would be interested in finding out what the percentage of drug related type things are , 
there must be a very great degree of that . 
but there again i do not know if the jury system itself comes in to play there . 
i would think that , 
of course it is a constitutional right that the press must have here , is the interviewing of jurors after the trial . 
it seems to me that when a jury makes a decision , they should not be asked before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision . 
i imagine there is a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that . 
i know , 
i was there during the trial actually , 
and the opposite was true of me . 
it was a picture is not good enough . 
we want to see , 
i do not know what they wanted honestly . 
i do not know . 
just because you feel like he was being kicked on , which he certainly was . 
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted . 
i felt that way . 
but it does not matter . 
the guy was obviously guilty . 
i always balanced in the situation . 
i remember the jurors , 
one count . 
but i do not know , 
maybe when you are there in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody . 
and the prosecutors do a lousy job , 
or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it . 
that might be it . 
i think i am getting a call coming in . 
nice talking with you . 
it has been nice talking to you . 
thank you . 
and i have a friend who 's real good with repairing cars 
so we went to a place called quality auto parts 
and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and everything 
and they 're , very reasonable . 
we put it on the car 
and it did n't work , 
he hooked it up right . 
it was just that the part just did n't fit the car , 
so . i took it back 
and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them 
so we went back and tried it again , put it on again 
and it still did n't work , 
and we took the car up to a little place called pep boys , 
i do n't know if you have them in your area 
but they 're pretty reasonable car repair place also . 
but there 's just some little difference that causes it not to work , 
they probably built that in so they could make money . 
i guess so 
and that was my last experience . 
there 's a little sensing device right in front of the fan , 
it 's an air conditioner sensing device . 
i do n't know why , 
there 's a metal piece that fits through the belts , 
and somehow that broke off 
and i still ca n't figure out how it broke , 
and i have n't had too many problems with my car , 
and then just basic maintenance and oil changes 
and i do not do my oil changes 
and i will not do my oil changes . 
borrowed somebody else 's jack 
and i did this 
and i went and bought everything , 
and then to go to the trouble , 
as far as any maintenance on my car , i shy away from the oil changes , 
that 's for sure . 
and i really had n't had any trouble with it until that 
and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it 
and this was just recent , 
so i really ca n't complain about this one . 
how did you put that many miles on it , in , four or five years ? 
and i did that for about three years 
and it really added up . 
and the rest of it it 's just basically driving a long ways to work . 
so , i 'm getting little relief , 
but still i drive a long ways . 
i do . 
do you ? 
i was going to ask you as far as how we 're getting compensated for what we 're doing right now , 
i do n't know what you want to call them , 
fake point things , 
points . 
and i just wondering how i go about getting the cash . 
there 's a number that you call , 
it 's the same number that you call to make a call . 
you call that number 
and , somehow or another they 'll give you an option to leave a message 
and you can leave a message . 
i know someone that did that , 
you leave a message 
and they 'll call you back . 
that 's good to know . 
this is the first time i 've been called in a long time 
and i have n't been doing it 
and i 've done it maybe twelve times . 
i do n't know if i 've done it quite that much , 
but mine is mixed up too , 
i have to call and get it fixed . 
let 's see 
but i bought it used . 
i just bought it from a friend who just charged me what the dealer was going to give him for it for a trade-in , 
and it had a whole lot of miles on it . 
i figured maybe i 'd get one or two years out of it , 
an i did get a couple of good years out of it 
and he took the engine apart 
and he just said he could n't fix it 
so the engine never got put back together again . 
i do n't know , 
the body was in good condition 
and it ran fine . 
it was starting to burn some oil . 
you just do n't see cars like that . 
and they last a long time . 
and they were simple too , 
the engines were simple and durable 
and some people will still buy them , 
i guess it 's still easy to find engines for those cars , engines and transmissions 
and i guess if you keep changing them out you can keep a car for a long time . 
it almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it , you 're just better off buying another car . 
i guess so , 
but i just think they cost too much in the first place , now a days . 
my voice ? 
the topic today was gardening , and lawn care ? 
i know , 
we are about to hit it in , few minutes . 
i figured i could make this call and get it over with . 
we are going to mow and trim and edge , 
and that is all we have been doing all weekend . 
you know what ? 
it seems like we are doing it here forever . 
it probably was up to your shoulder in thistles . 
that was all that was there . 
and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted 
or the plants do not make the winter time . 
how many kids do you have ? 
just two , 
so it seems like a lot more . 
how old are they ? 
four and five . 
four and five . 
and i do not know if that counts . 
you do not have to tend to him . 
i did for many years . 
you did . 
it is over with . 
he is gone . 
it is over with . 
back to gardening . 
but i do not . 
it is like i will get out there and pull my weeds . 
i do not have a real big front yard . 
but i do have half of it is a flower bed , just about , all by the porch . 
because the porch is pretty big , 
i live in town . 
but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts . 
i do not like it . 
and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff . 
and i just plowed through the whole nine yards . 
got up everything . 
so i just broke all them off . 
have you ever seen those ? 
they are pretty in the spring . 
but the leaves , i do not like them . 
because that is a bulb . 
it is a bulb . 
you should of just ripped the whole thing out . 
because i like the plant in the spring . 
i love those pink flowers . 
they are just pretty . 
so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down . because i want them to come back up next year . 
is this the first year they have been up ? 
let me tell you , 
they do not come back very well at all . 
maybe they will up further north . 
and you are not that much further north . 
i have probably planted around here maybe six hundred bulbs . 
of everything . 
and if they do come back next year , they are going to look real puny . 
they will ? 
and , everybody down here calls these flags . the irises i guess , 
they call them flags ? 
that is what they call them down here . 
i am not sure what they are called . 
i think they are stopped blooming now , in the spring . 
and what color ? 
they come in all different colors . 
and you only get one of them ? 
per bulb . 
you get one big flower that looks like a lily . 
i do not know what they are called . 
i do not know what i have called them . 
but when i come down here , everybody told me they are flags . 
you know what i bet you 
they are ? 
and i am a pretty good gardener 
because i have killed a lot of things here 
and i have planted a lot of them . 
and i work on a landscape committee for our neighborhood . 
it is some type of lily . 
does it fit that , 
and it is a bulb . 
i really do not know . 
i am going to bet you that , 
that has got to be blooming this time of year . 
they are dead now . 
i was just going to correct myself . 
right about the same time or after . 
i do not much care for them . 
and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves . 
but i took them out of my front yard , 
i went out there this spring , 
and they had took root right where they were , on top of each other . 
and they told me that they are the hardest things to kill . 
but they are real easy to grow . 
does that help ? . 
i am not sure what it is . 
they said that they are irises . 
but they call them flags down here . 
i do not know what it is . 
i am just getting into gardening this year . 
did you just move down here ? 
we moved here a year ago . 
last spring . 
we moved in this house , may of last year . 
so it was really too late to do much . 
and i am into that . 
and it looks quite formal . 
it really does , 
it looks quite formal . 
but it has been about three or four years of playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here . 
what kind of blue ? 
you want blue ? 
and blue looks so pretty against it . 
blue is hard . 
you will see them blooming now . 
but you can get them in the nursery . 
i am looking for a pen . 
that is where i went this year . 
because i waited too late to really plant stuff . 
like i said , i do not know anything about plants . 
the nursery men will sell you things here . 
and they are kind of in a labor of love . 
that is what i did with my plants . 
and they will not grow down here . 
perennial . 
blue . 
but it insists on full sun . 
and it looks pretty good out there . 
it is really a pretty plant . 
it is sold down here as purple buddy . 
purple buddy ? 
it is not a perennial , 
it is an annual . 
but it will take the heat down here . 
purple buddy . 
purple buddy . 
how do you spell that ? 
and they make about a foot high plant . 
i do not know . 
and the crime here is pretty bad . 
i was going to say . 
there is a lot of crime down there . 
you leave your car for ten minutes 
and it is stripped when you come back . 
have you ever been there ? 
i have not . 
only to the airport . 
that is probably enough to see . 
are you in college right now ? 
i work for the air force . 
so , there is a base up here . 
that 's interesting concept . 
are bases safe ? 
bases are pretty safe because they check your i d on your way in . 
they , minimize the access . 
that is wonderful . 
we moved here about ten months ago . 
so we are out of the city , 
but it is pretty scary . 
people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods 
but they are still bars . 
that makes it bad for getting out during a fire . 
it really does . 
and if you are a little bit claustrophobic 
but . i do not know , 
the jails are crowded . 
i am not a criminal justice specialist , 
so i do not know what can be done . 
i do not know , 
i think it is getting worse . because i keep hearing things 
but i went home , 
and this thing came on where a group of five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and robbing them . 
and my mom was `` they should just be all shot right now . '' 
were they teenagers 
i think they were early twenties . 
they were young men . 
i know it . 
those are a thousand bucks . 
unless they stole it . 
and that is one big thing down here . 
and they are not all young . 
sometimes it is the same people that have been observed 
and they still ca n't catch them . 
i know it is getting worse . 
i do not know what the world is or is not . 
and they said that he was twelve years old , 
i know . 
i do not know . 
i wonder where he gets it ? 
i do not know how it is in the air force base . 
but i just do not think a lot of people both need to work . 
i just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more . 
they do not talk to their kids and take them out . and are not there all the time 
so the kids are off to their own devices a lot . 
and discipline . 
i do not know how your folks were , 
but i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that my parents were the superior 
and i was the subordinate . 
and it was sort of like there were boundaries . 
and i do not know , 
i think today a lot of parents are ruled by their kids . 
i think so definitely . 
they are not learning boundaries . 
i see it in work place too , sometimes . 
i do not know how old you are , 
but you sound a little bit younger than me . 
but , i am in my thirties , 
i hate to say it , 
but that 's just what it is . 
it is an attitude like the world owes them something . 
i see that too in the air force . 
do you ? 
especially since a lot of us are engineers where i work . 
are you in the air force ? 
i am in the air force . 
and so people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do . 
get it for all it is worth . 
and i am you are the one who signed up . 
and the air force is one of the better military experiences . 
it is . 
i like it a lot . 
pardon me ? 
i like it so far . 
that is , are you going to be a career person ? 
but , i do not talk to many people in the military . 
probably not . 
but they pay for my college . 
that is the way to do it . 
i do not know , 
i go to an aerobics class or something . 
and you are supposed to feel safe , 
it does not matter , 
and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards . 
and i do not even think that way , 
nobody can think that it ca n't happen to them . 
no matter who they are or where they are at . 
and you never know who is watching , either . 
i do not know , 
i was in the grocery store this morning . 
and it is about seven hours . 
we had never been there . 
that is a very , very neat town to visit . in terms of the french quarter and all of the things you hear about . 
but the crime is so bad there . 
in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do . 
how to carry your wallet , 
do not even bother . 
it is not worth it . 
i was in the super market this morning 
and on the cover of time magazine , there is a girl , 
she is on the east coast somewhere . 
real attractive young girl . 
college freshman , college coed . 
i think she is a freshman . 
she had been dating a fellow for several weeks . 
and date rape . 
she looked anguished . 
it was really just sad . 
did not pick it up and read it , 
but i should have . 
but i just looked at the picture and thought , what a world . 
i know . 
you ca n't trust anybody . 
i do not have any cure , 
it is really scary . 
you really ca n't . 
and they have a real big thing here . 
even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting . 
everybody wants your business kind of thing . 
and i think sometimes it is just , he and i are very different in terms of that . 
and he opened the door . 
and i was real upset 
and i probably got more nasty than i should have . 
you , hear about people opening the door and getting blown away . 
and it is not a reason . 
you should not deny yourself going to visit and all that . 
but it is not any worse . 
but i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city i have been in . 
so i would say one thing . 
i would not want to go by myself . 
but i do not know . 
i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals . 
i am not real big on guns myself . 
i think our justice system needs to be stricter because they do it 
and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like . 
they are booked up . 
but , are they booked up ? 
that is a way to put it , 
they are booked up . 
and here it is just a real big deal . 
and then they are out doing it again . 
i do not know . because i am not real up on a lot of news things . 
but you just hear about that , 
it is a lot of repeat crime . 
and you are why are they repeating ? 
they should have been in there longer . 
i know . 
i have not been out of school that long , 
but it has been at least ten years . 
and you think to yourself , was it that bad back then ? 
i think that , like you said , television ? 
is it just that more people think there is excitement in it ? 
people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something . 
they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone . 
so they picked on this kid who was new in town . 
and they were no one was going to miss him anyway , 
that is horrible . 
how can you even think like that ? 
is n't it something ? 
i think kids get too much too fast . and all those sort of things . 
kids killing each other and beating their brains out . 
for the sneakers . 
or the jackets , the team the raiders and the caps . 
stealing the hundred dollar jackets . 
that is probably one of the most bizarre i have heard of . 
where they videotape themselves . 
how do you feel about it ? 
i feel much the same way . 
i 've two kids right now 
one is two and a half 
and one 's nine months , 
and that age , of course , everything you do they 're trying to learn to do , 
and so it 's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn that they need to learn at the age reading and playing nice with others , and that sort of thing . 
we went through this with our children , and now with our grandchildren , 
and i 've always tried to do things with them like , when you 're at the little league , helping out even though i 'm not a good athlete myself , 
i was able to help the coach in just controlling the kids , if nothing else , 
and we 've always tried to take our children and our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to . 
i think that 's just part of their overall educational process , is to get out and see and do things . 
and where we 've lived , we 've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area , 
and it helps the children when they 're learning in school , to say , i 've been there 
and i 've seen that . 
that 's the type , 
it certainly does , because the things in the books seem so dead to the kids unless they 've actually been there or whatever , 
because i remember our family we went everywhere . 
and we could read the things in the history books and understand what they said , when it was we need to raise food quickly because this place gets very cold very soon . 
we 've gone through that , 
i remember my parents did n't do all those type things , 
and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that . 
and even now with my grandchildren , i feel it 's a very important thing to be done . 
because if kids do n't look up to you , or , ca n't feel they can spend time with you , they 're going to find someone else 
and nowadays there 's a lot of people out there that you do n't want your kid emulating or whatever . 
i think it was in the sixth grade , 
they had to write a little brief autobiography of themselves , and about what they had done and what they wanted to do , 
and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him . 
a real point of pride with me . 
that is nice . 
so that the only reason i 'm home is because i 'm home with a cold . 
and the wife says , you need something to do , 
talk to a guy on the phone . 
we 're kind of far apart here . 
this is a very interesting program i heard about here on this , 
and when i signed up for it , it looked like it could make a real contribution in participating . 
likewise we do some projects every now and then . 
we like to get support from other companies as well . 
i 'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan . 
trying to work myself out of a job . 
but , it 's been an interesting roughly nine months here , 
and again , this is our home area . 
we enjoy living here . 
it 's where we originally started out , 
so , wound up back about two hundred miles away from where we started out . 
that 's about all i can think to talk about right now . 
it 's been a pleasure talking with you . 
thank you . 
i live right on the ocean 
but the major cause here is the car pollution . 
we do n't have too much industrial pollution . 
car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that i can really put my finger on here . 
and the transportation situation is such that all the car pollution is absolutely awful . 
interestingly some of the information i 've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from airplanes is extraordinary . 
is that so ? 
i did n't know that . 
and that 's always something that you do n't think about . 
most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution . 
i would think so . 
i guess it talked about all types of pollution . 
i just read something the other day 
and now they 've located another one or rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere . 
so i 'm quite concerned . 
from what i understand it 's air conditioning units 
and , we certainly turned into an air conditioned society . 
you know what it 's like here . 
it 's really out of the norm not to find something that is n't air conditioned . 
and i guess refrigerators , are the same way . 
they release that . 
that 's right . 
i guess to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get , getting people upset about animal rights . 
this is so basic . 
it 's human rights in the sense , 
but demanding that we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward improvement of polluting vehicles , and not just cars but also buses planes . that something can be done . 
converter , 
and no lead gas came to the pumps . 
and that 's been done . 
there 's the lead pollution 
and i think that there are solutions , 
certainly we do n't even need a research anymore . 
it 's just a matter of passing the law , 
and passing the law depends on how heavy the automobile lobby is . 
that 's right . 
and also to make it economically feasible . 
and also in buses . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
i do n't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus , 
the smell is awful 
but i was reading the other day that , diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes . 
so , i guess you 're better off sitting behind a bus than a car although i could never , really rationalize that while i was sitting there . 
but even , of course , in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels . 
we 've taken the intermediate step 
but i do n't think , fossil fuels are the answer . 
went on for years . 
my feelings were that we needed this bridge to jump from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be . 
you do n't throw the baby out with the bath water , and condemning nuclear use . 
unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years . 
so we really do n't know whether there 's enough fossil fuel left or there is n't , 
but with the pollution issue fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway . 
so you 've got to look elsewhere . 
but it is something that 's a little frightening 
i have two sons , 
and we just feel that when we leave this area , we 're going north , not south . 
i like the mentality north , 
that 's right . 
so that 's the way we will be going . 
so , i 'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how their attitudes are . 
i read that the other day . 
but it 's the industrial pollution i should imagine . 
you read about the fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they 're enforcing . 
but again that did n't occur without a crisis . 
nothing will occur without a crisis . 
the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as i 'm concerned , is the no smoking rules , on airplanes and in restaurants . 
and it really is a pleasure for me , although , i guess smokers do n't think that . 
but that , to me was pollution , 
that 's personal air pollution . 
that was its most personal , pollution that i can think of . 
i , definitely advance that . 
listen 
i enjoyed speaking with you . 
and let 's hope there are other people that feel the same way . 
something happen . 
thank you . 
you 're welcome . 
i understand that the real estate market out there has really gone crazy , up and down , up and down . 
i think right now it 's kind of bad . 
i do n't live in a house , 
i live in an apartment . 
are you in a house ? 
i guess the best i can do is , compare apartments . 
if it can compare the one that i have now , with the one that i had the last time , the one that i have now has a lot more amenities than the one that i moved out of . 
this one gave us free cable and ceiling fans 
and it was practically new when i moved in here 
and the carpet was new 
it 's just a two story building . 
but there are a lot of buildings 
but it 's just two stories . 
so you have one floor all to yourself ? 
the rooms are nice and large 
and , let 's see , 
that 's nice . 
but they did n't provide it . 
the one that i moved from did n't have a place to put them , 
and that 's one of the reasons that i did move . 
that is nice . 
i 've always been pretty lucky . 
the real estate out here 's been pretty good . 
the prices came down last year . 
it just never happened before . 
so it 's really surprising everybody . 
all the developers do n't know what to do . 
it 's a good time to buy , if you 're in the market . 
we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids 
and we have a three bedroom house . 
and it 's pretty much filled up right now . 
so you want a bigger one . 
get an extra bedroom or a basement . 
and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment . 
and they had a basement , 
and they finished the basement , 
and they were able to rent that out also . 
and i 've looked at a lot of them . 
a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there , 
and that 's what he said was that it just was n't something that people had down there . 
they put pools and garages on , but no basements . 
i have yet to see a basement in a house . 
maybe it 's all the sand . 
i always think it 's like a desert , 
i do n't know . 
i do n't see that kind of sand here . 
or the foundation is sinking or something just a little bit , some more than others . 
but you have to know the right spot , to pick where that does n't happen . 
it 's just , you go down four inches 
and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast . 
i see . 
that 's right . 
it 's sort of unusual really . 
my folks used to live there . 
back before i was born , they lived there . 
so i imagine the type of houses and things like that are truly different from area to area . 
but that 's the same way out here 
that 's why we came out here . 
but it 's considered the country since it 's that far out . 
but 
i see . 
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here 
and it 's still pretty rural . 
land has gotten so expensive 
they just ca n't afford to have low income housing like that . 
is your house in an area by itself ? 
we 're in a development . 
it 's not connected to another one ? 
there 's another one a quarter acre away rather . 
but they 're not connected are they ? 
you have to stay in one single family home . 
i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up . 
my folks had an apartment for a while when we were kids 
and so as soon as we could we got a single family home , 
and that 's all i ever knew growing up , 
here we go . 
did you push one ? 
i have n't pushed one yet . 
i just started doing this 
so i do n't know too much about it . 
we 're just sort of getting acquainted here . 
i just wanted to see if you had an opinion about this , 
so , if that 's okay with you , then i 'll just press one . 
that will be fine . 
if i start this i just wanted to say that one of the things that i do n't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they 're a totally different type of people than we are , 
and they think differently 
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours . 
i think we should just leave them alone . 
i really do . in a major way because that whole region over there needs to settle its own differences within itself . 
and that 's the course that they should go , 
we can maybe help them a little bit , prompt them , 
but i do n't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on . 
and also the other thing is our idea of democracy has nothing to do with them . 
and maybe this is too general , 
but i just believe that they do not look at democracy the same way we do . 
they do n't understand it as we do n't understand the way they live . 
i do n't think that that 's the way to go in this 
and that 's a couple thoughts on it . 
i guess i 'd like you to maybe express something here . 
i think overall that 's right . 
i think it 's kind of sad though , that , for generations they 've been taught to hate each other . 
somewhere in there someone 's going to have to learn a different way . 
we do have completely different ways of looking at a lot of things , 
but at the same time , i think there is a lot of good that the united states and other countries can do , as far as example 
and , , i think some different things could come from what 's happened , than what we expect . 
i guess we could be a catalyst for their change . 
the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there 
and i do n't think we 'd be talking about this unless there had been a war . 
that was one thing , that came out of it , good or bad , 
i do n't judge any war as good or bad , 
it 's just a war . 
and i do n't see any winners or losers , 
i just see dead bodies . 
i 'm sorry , 
but i just think you 're right 
and i think maybe it 's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along . 
it 's not going to be that we 're going to sort of , tell them to go to their room 
and that 's going to solve the whole problem . 
it 's going to be them , 
but , that 's the type of thing they understand . 
they do n't understand any other way . 
and so at that , you have to work at their level , to an extent , too . 
that 's true too , 
they would n't have understood anything else than what we did in the war . 
they understand violence . 
there was nothing else . 
they love violent leaders , to , 
look at the leader they had . 
it has a lot to do with their religion . 
and i know this only because from personal experience , 
because i 've , traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where i 've done that 
every thought , 
they have a totally different life than we have . 
and when you add the commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them . 
and they have very basic life , 
it 's just a very basic life 
what 's sad is that the leaders that have control are power , 
and they abuse that . 
and it 's always been military 
and it 's always been , 
and that 's always been the way of the world . do n't you think . 
which i think that that 's not the way the majority of the people over there really are . 
so it 's really hard , when you see the leaders , compared to the people . 
but i think in a way all , the involvement over there too , though , has shown that there are a lot of people that do n't follow what those few are doing . 
and there are a lot of people who are good people . 
and surrendering , 
it just really comes down to people are people , 
that 's right . 
does n't matter where the boundaries are . 
there are political boundaries 
and those are man made boundaries , 
and i think so much of it is what you 're taught . 
that 's true . 
stay in line for four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor . 
i 'm sort of mixed on this . 
you go to whoever you want but file through one particular , setup 
i see . 
and that way they are able to reduce prices because it 's all one centralized thing . 
i think that again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own , if you do n't have a company picking up the major portion of your health insurance , the cost is almost prohibitive . 
i was listening on the radio the other day 
they could make it , provide health insurance to people who could n't afford it just by the money they would save . 
we 're currently , where i 'm working now , under blue cross . 
i do n't know what the total cost of the program is 
they 're probably picking up about half of it . 
and that 's a pretty good policy , 
and they 're fairly expensive . 
i forget how much i paid a month 
but it is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care . 
and the reason i quite was not because i did n't like it , 
i really kind of did . 
so my wife decided she wanted to stay with that doctor , 
so , we went to the medical insurance that we have here at work , 
once you find the doctor that you like it 's not a problem . 
a lot of people complain saying i do n't want to have to be told who i need to go to 
but if you do n't have a doctor anyway normally it does n't really make much difference . if you find someone you really like 
that 's right . 
and then , we did find several good doctors . 
and like you say it 's five dollars an office visit . 
and my wife was in the hospital had our daughter 
and i think her total bill was around three hundred dollars for everything . 
delivery room and everything . 
including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay 
but that was still included in that cost 
they 're trying to prevent a problem by keeping the cost down at the front end and have you come in , 
they charge five dollars a pop , 
you 're more willing to go in and try , to take care of a problem before it grows big . 
i really liked it . 
my wife and i both did . 
you do n't have to worry about filling out forms for reimbursement and all or getting paid eight percent of whatever . 
you just pay the five dollars right then 
and then you 're done with it . 
but here again the doctor 's practices in hospitals , have become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now . 
you take a hospital the physical plant itself , 
you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building when the rooms are empty . 
so , they spread the costs out over all the patient costs 
and that 's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that . the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and it being , a four thousand dollar bill . 
they 're taking up the cost of people who ca n't pay . 
they get a lot of , people who just have to be there and ca n't afford it 
and so they know they 're not going to get money from them 
so they , have to absorb it somewhere else . 
he 'll be three in august . 
and their insurance plan that they 're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital . 
and she went in , 
she had the baby 
and she was out in two days time . 
and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital , 
the deductibles did n't apply . 
and so that 's one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by if you 'll shorten your stay then we will waive the deductible . 
where was your last vacation ? . 
we went home to visit family . 
it was n't actually . 
we took a cruise 
and we went to four different islands 
we had a great time . 
we were there for ten days . 
so where have you been ? 
i 've been lots of places . 
that one would count , 
that was about a year and a half ago , 
my husband is french 
and i needed to get that continent since i , had n't been there yet . 
and actually it 's a fairly common vacation place for french people to go 
and they speak french 
so , in that sense is just a little bit easier 
and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go . 
so we did n't really have enough time . 
i 'm sure it was wonderful . 
we had about , a little bit less than two weeks . 
and as always , it seems a bit rushed . 
we do a lot of traveling around . 
we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere . 
was it hot ? 
in fact some of the days we froze . 
i do n't remember which , 
but i was very young 
so i do n't remember that 
and , i was three when we moved back here . 
that 's too bad 
so i do n't remember 
but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been , 
and that was when i was a baby 
because that area of the world would be great . 
it was a very interesting vacation . 
and we had nothing taken because we knew 
and we had things in inside pockets and in jacket underneath a coat type of thing . 
and i guess they make all their money on tourism 
and they would come up and ask you if you want to buy different things 
and after awhile it really gets annoying , 
it 's a little scary too when they 're coming up and they 're all over you . 
and the other cities it was n't nearly as bad 
and a couple of them it was , 
what we did in some of the other cities is to hire a local guide 
it does n't matter who it is 
and they keep everyone else away from you . 
and it 's worth it 
and it 's ten dollars a day or something 
and you feel stupid doing that 
but we did it , 
and we were much happier , 
and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone , 
that 's great . 
where else have you been ? 
and so , hopefully , we 'll get to travel a little bit too . 
lots of wildlife ? 
if you like wildlife , it 's a fabulous vacation . 
if you do n't like wildlife it 's probably not of interest . 
and just the photos i have of it 
and incredible 
and be so close , 
when was that , 
when were you there ? 
a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings 
actually i did n't go diving . 
diving . 
i did n't get to the great barrier reef . 
it 's gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . 
the coastline was just incredible . 
it 's huge . 
is it really ? 
i do n't think so . 
i remember food . 
i like that too . 
but in fact i did n't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car , 
it would have been much more fun to do it in the van , with a bunch of people . 
you went by yourself . 
and i was by myself in china too . 
china was a little bit more of a challenge . 
but , it was n't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time , 
and so i never got out by myself , or not much , 
was it very expensive ? 
maybe it was about a thousand dollars , maybe a little bit less for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare 
but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there 
it 's just a train ride . 
i had two internal plane flights and a couple of other things . 
all for a thousand dollars ? 
that really surprises me . 
around a thousand . 
and i did n't stay in the top of the line hotels 
they were all completely clean , 
and they were newly built 
and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line , hotels , because they said you ca n't stay in the cheap stuff . 
i highly recommend that way to go . 
if you 're ever interested in going the route , i dealt with this woman , 
and she just gave me this woman 's name to contact 
and it would really be fun , 
i think ideally with two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide 
i grew up out in the country and was used to having guns around the place 
i think i 'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself . 
i have quite a collection myself 
and i 'm a good hunter 
and i started hunting when i was twelve years old . 
of course , my parents made me take hunters safety classes 
and i do n't want to see them ban guns completely 
but i do n't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either 
i believe that . 
and i believe that too because the person that is wanting to , commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun , a knife , a rock , a stick , whatever it is , to commit a crime with , 
and it 's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns , 
we can handle it 
but there 's an element that ca n't . 
and it 's got to the point now where even our police departments and our d e a agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons 
because everybody that 's in drug trafficking has got them . 
you know . 
it 's sure not . 
it was n't really gun control 
you had to register as a gun owner , 
you did n't have to list your guns , 
but you had to have this card , 
it was like a driver 's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition 
this was twenty years ago . 
but they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect . 
rifles are n't too bad , 
and i bought a pistol there 
that 's not a bad idea . 
i think that a waiting period can make a difference 
it is . 
course , i feel kind of weird about that 
anyway , i think if somebody shoots somebody , they ought to be shot . 
we 're getting into capital punishment now . 
it would definitely be gun control . 
again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used is what the purpose should be . 
it 's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose , legal purpose but to keep the guy that 's illegal from getting his hands on one . 
and i 'm in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands 
myself . 
and they 're actually a necessity in life . 
not everybody needs a gun 
but sooner or later i need one . 
i did in the service but not on the street 
so i do n't really need one in the , 
you do n't have to carry one in your car or your pocket all the time . 
so i use mine for recreation , 
and i enjoyed my guns . 
i have a good time with them 
i know what , 
i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a gun . 
my wife the same thing , 
she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have 
not that i have an arsenal or anything , 
but we have several guns around the house 
if someone gets shot with a , real gun they do n't get back up . 
i 've got a six year old now 
they understand now . 
i 've taken time to teach them 
and now the young boy wants to know 
and i told him , you 're a little bit young for a gun . 
let me go out here 
and we would start with the b b gun deal , 
so he started with the b b gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows 
and i took it away from him , 
i said now , you know , 
so he 's learning the hard way 
it was my mother 's uncle , 
and , i was probably about twelve at the time , 
and he let me shoot and showed me how . 
i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one . 
i do n't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away , 
we agreed pretty well on this i think . 
i think so . 
it 's been real nice talking with you . 
have a good one . 
the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced reporting methods , with computers and other devices . 
compile more statistics . 
that 's right , 
and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets . 
however , i have been persuaded , lately simply by the overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime . 
more especially where you are . 
i was going to say , 
i do a lot of business here , 
and i come here quite often 
and that again is a sort of media perception 
it just really grabs your attention . 
it just makes the whole place seem like that . 
and i see that even he was met with little success , even though quite a bit of money and other planning efforts went into that . 
what do you think is causing all this , 
crime , though i think it is increasing in number , it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity , and violence too . 
i have three theories about it three things . 
i have one theory , 
and it 's brought to us by two things . 
one i believe that this is a function of the violence that young people see on television and the movies . 
and , i am not just talking about role models of tough guys and gangsters and things like that , 
the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the argument . 
and then i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree , 
i have not seen that , 
that 's what i think about it , 
that 's some of the things i think about it , 
plus i do not know , 
what are your views ? 
it seems anymore a movie can not be considered good unless there 's just some sort of violence , or something in it . 
and then you start making a movie 
and there 's no call for something violent , 
so they just throw something in there just to say they have it . 
that 's the impression i get . 
and i imagine that it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society , 
it conditions people to it 
it has to be even magnified to attract people 's attention to have them spend money on something like that . 
and i am sure that it does form role models for young men and young women 
seems that those things did not happen in that manner before television . 
and i have to think that it has some influence on it . 
i do not know if you listen to him or not , 
and they were just really coming down on him because of just some of the things that he believed in , some of his morals . 
and he said `` you bet , 
i believe in discipline '' . 
and people , i guess they confused discipline with punishment . 
it seems anymore that if you have this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you . 
it 's everybody has to be free to do their own thing . 
and i disagree , 
and i think that 's really contributing to this high rate of crime . 
i guess what i wanted to say and i stopped was that , there 's so much of a return to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure . 
and that is not emphasized . 
and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now , that 's complicated the entire process . 
it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you live 
or . i do not mean attachment and responsibility , 
nobody feels responsibility to do something . 
it 's i wish they would stop doing that . 
that 's right . 
the changes come simply by statutory nature . 
i do not know what it really will take . 
i am sort of an advocate of having free speech 
and i guess to curb the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that . 
it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort . 
and the sacrifice is not that great . 
what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do . 
i think that 's correct . 
and 
and it seems to me they are a pretty tough law and order state , 
just citing that . 
we have got a lot of that influence . 
this is really peculiar , 
most of the husbands cook . 
the wives during the day get so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day . 
they do n't really care about gourmet stuff , 
but it was the guys that got together and did all this . 
that 's nice . 
and my husband just , he really , really likes to cook in terms of barbecue , 
and all guys like to barbecue . 
i 'm telling you , 
but he really does cook 
and it 's a good thing because you ca n't knock that . 
but all these other guys do too , 
and so we 've gotten together 
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals . 
and it 's really , really kind of a neat thing to do . 
how often do you meet ? 
we try , 
because everybody is so active with their kids and all that . 
it 's like if we can do it once every six months , we 're doing well . 
so we originally started out when we were younger and did n't have so much stuff going on with the kids . 
then we tried to do it every other month , 
but lately it 's just been once every six months . 
that 's much more reasonable . 
i was involved in a club where we tried to really do gourmet meals . 
and we were a little bit too frequent i think . 
i do n't remember if we were once a month 
or anyway it was difficult . 
so by the time we got around to each of us and it was time again , we were almost tired partly because gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining . 
it 's too rich . 
it is absolutely . 
and , so , we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day . 
and then one of the couples moved 
and so we sort of did n't continue it , 
and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time , then you do n't have as much time for regular entertaining , 
and that sometimes means you ca n't do gourmet , because depending on who your guests are . 
that 's true . 
and we have a gourmet friend that ca n't stand fish 
one of my friends does n't eat any cheese at all . 
so that 's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese . 
i take that back . 
she ca n't eat some cream cheese . 
but that really limits , 
so we try to keep all that in mind , 
i guess i have recipes 
but that 's basically what we do is the gourmet , 
so they would be pretty elaborate . 
but it 's fun . 
it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff , 
and you get all prepared 
but you 're right . 
it 's very , very rich 
because it 's quite a treat 
it really is . 
sounds wonderful . 
but you like food 
and i just love the community of food . 
i just , think it 's neat . 
i do too . 
i just love sharing meals and whatever you can do to do that . 
and i did a cop out on to it 
i 'm buying cold cuts . 
i have to , make a cake 
what are you providing ? 
and i have to make dessert 
so , i figured for the main thing it 's going to be sandwiches . 
there you go . 
so i 'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on . 
but i ca n't do it working full-time 
and , it 's just too much . 
i know . 
those people that try to do everything . 
would n't that be nice ? . 
shot a video of the whole thing , 
i do n't know . 
but it 's really kind of a neat thing . 
i get a kick out of it . 
i really do . 
everything , all parts of the food , 
and people really pretty much appreciate it . 
they do . 
it 's very difficult to purchase items that are as good as what you can make yourself . 
i think so . 
or if you do buy it , it 's extremely expensive . 
in fact i just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts 
and i 've never been there before . and found that there 's individual vendors 
and the foods are wonderful . 
there you go . 
but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful , 
and they had black forest cherry cake and all those things . 
they are not commercial bakery made . 
and in that they are made in their homes 
so it 's kind of interesting , 
it 's out there if you want to pay the price 
it is . 
we have bakeries around here that you just gain weight going by the door 
just like that . 
just smelling the air . 
but i do n't know 
i get off on strange little details of food , i guess . 
this is the southwest , 
so . that 's a really good party time , eating all that hot food 
and they just love it down here . 
we like hot food too , 
all the stuff that goes with that , 
i 'm not . 
i thought , that there was a slight difference in accent . 
i 'll bet . 
in fact , it just came to mind , 
tell me about china cry . 
i see . 
her dad was a doctor 
and he was rather well to do in the old regime 
everybody was back to a commonality of one . 
i think i 'm leaving out a portion . 
she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had gotten a job as an instructor 
being a child . 
they kept on and on at her , 
and in the meantime , she and her husband were expecting their own child . 
and the people kept harassing her over a period of months 
and finally they carried her out into the courtyard either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of shooting her or executing her by firing squad . 
she 's one of mine , 
she is not going to die 
and her life was spared . 
and this frightened the commandant 
and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp . 
and , course , here 's this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around . 
and then she put in to go see him . 
and , of course , she had to walk . 
they stripped her of everything , practically besides the clothes on her back . 
so she went across the border to her husband and other child that they 'd already had to freedom . 
and they knew that she was n't going to come back , 
but she did , years later when the liberalization of china happened , 
and she was not persecuted or anything else like that . 
. interesting story . 
it was . 
very moving , too . 
i do n't even remember seeing that advertised 
and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly . 
. that recent . 
i see what you mean . 
it had large press release . 
i guess what i saw most recently was sort of light by comparison . 
my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy 
and , we ended up going to see green card . 
green card ? 
green card . 
and he chose it 
i see , 
so she was a horticulturist , 
and that was sort of her dream . 
i see , 
of course they got married 
and they never saw each other again . 
except fate through them together 
so they had to get back together and get their stories straight , 
but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was . 
he 'd been working in a restaurant when they met . 
and they had to learn all about each other basically in a weekend . 
just then . 
you knew what was going to happen , of course . that they would fall in love . 
they fell into like , at any rate 
he was so proud of himself for giving all the correct answers that on the last one he said , i never remember that answer 
everyone thinks taxes are too high i 'm sure . 
but i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases . 
what do you think ? 
i think so . 
i think i 'm , a little out of the ordinary in that i think i 'm more worried about the national deficit than , a lot of other people are and think that we need to either raise our taxes or cutback on something 
and i do n't know what to cutback on to get that settled . 
at this stage it 's hard , to tell . 
and , i know i 'm real , out of it in terms of taxes 
i think so . 
i know 
and it 's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house . 
but now we 're getting public services , the schools , the hospitals 
and if it were n't for the taxes we 're putting in there look what the schools could cost you . 
then again the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent , 
and the public , colleges also , the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country . 
i do n't know which one it is down there down there that are proposing doubling the tuition . 
if you double the tuition , it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states . 
i think that 's right . 
that would provide possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things . 
the so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount , 
but eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even . 
i do n't know about that , 
i quit ten years ago 
so i could n't afford to start again . 
i see . 
that would be true . 
that would be true . 
i know my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think . 
and even if it , is n't going to provide you with any services in that it 's not doing to provide a route from your home to a business , for instance . 
this is a thing 
i think it 's like back east . 
you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities . 
and the other thing is that when the public transportation is established that early on then the business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that . 
and some , people do n't even own a car and know how to drive a car . 
an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street . 
and i 'm just as guilty as anyone else . 
i drive to work every day by myself without , even any thought of car pooling . 
and most people are that way . because they 're used to not having public transportation . 
i felt that was a little wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying . 
a little bit much . 
that 's about all i can say at this time . 
i think so , 
i think that will probably do it , 
it 's been real nice talking with you . 
good enough . 
so what movies have you seen lately ? 
lately i 've seen soap dish . 
and that was a lot of fun . 
that 's something i want to see , 
that 's on my list to see . 
it was okay . 
it was not a wonderful film 
but it was cute but not the biggest laugh i 've seen . 
did you ? 
actually i saw it twice because i liked it so much . 
that 's also on my list . 
and it 's really disturbing but a good movie . 
a disturbing movie , 
how do you mean ? 
let 's see . 
it 's different , 
it 's an shoot 'em up kind of film . 
but it 's with women in it instead of men 
so that 's kind of a twist on the normal thing . 
so , that was kind of interesting . 
but i really enjoyed it . 
that 's kind of what it was . 
they had started out with that , 
then they got into lots of trouble . 
before we found the shopping malls that 's what we did . 
i 'll have to keep that on my list then . 
it 's truth or dare 
i can imagine . 
and so it was interesting . 
i guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is , 
they talked about her , 
it was a film of her concert tour she had taken all around the world . 
and she , kept saying that her show was not garbage . 
it had a social message to it 
you just had to find it . 
you had to wade through it and find it . 
we never quite believed that , 
i thought that was pushing it a little bit 
she is . 
she 's rich . 
and she 's rich 
she 's smart at what she does . 
she knows how to do that . 
she knows how to twist this around , 
we 're getting back to last year . 
how can i tell you . 
maybe ten years ago i had read bury my heart at wounded knee 
i really liked it a lot . 
it was a real consciousness raiser , i guess . 
and then everything went away for a couple years , 
and now it 's back again . 
and it 's sort of a popular view of what happened way back then . 
of course , no one will ever know . 
i know , 
who knows . 
one was a warring tribe , 
so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world . 
nobody can get along peacefully . 
but i wonder 
and that was so wonderful that they done that 
i see . 
you did n't , hear any press about that . 
i thought it was a very interesting movie . 
i think so . 
i have come to respect a little bit more what went on here , 
but who knows how it 's supposed to all end . 
on the broad scope it had a much bigger meaning to me about just the meaning of the freedom of this country and what that really meant . 
so it meant something bigger i think . 
but he 's the director . 
but 
i just thought it was a really interesting , intense film . 
that 's good . 
intense i think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast . 
it was good . 
i looked at my watch only a few times , which is a good thing . 
but it put me in a really bad mood , 
i do n't know why . 
did it really ? 
there were three of us who went . 
so we decided that may be the mark of a good film . 
it made us think . 
it made you think . 
but there are no answers . 
i know 
and we had , nothing to do with it . 
that can make you crabby , 
we were not responsible , 
but we still felt the thick blame for , what had gone on . 
that 's true . 
they sort of candy coated the western story for many years , 
it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story 
have you seen any other movies ? 
because you sound like you see a lot . 
i do . 
i 'm just out of school 
do n't have a job 
so i should n't go see movies all the time . 
there you go . 
it was just , wonderful . 
or he works in a movie theater 
and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years . 
i thought i had to kind of get beyond that . 
reading the little words at the bottom of the screen 
and , i really loved it . 
i 'll have to write that down . 
that was a great one . 
i 'll have to write that , 
i had n't . 
i had read the last picture show 
but that 's out on video now 
and i have n't seen it . 
did you like it ? 
it 's very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar things that people do with each other 
i 'm guessing you probably do . 
i do n't have one in my home here . 
my parents have one 
and they live just about three miles away , 
so we use that one . 
i see . 
and they 're almost as close . 
and what kinds of things do you use it for when you go to them ? 
usually word processing something such as forms for things 
also i have a nine year old that i 've been home schooling for the last three years . 
the one that my parents have is an apple two e . 
and so she got me copies of several of the apple programs for school programs , 
and so we use those 
so , that 's part of it . 
my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things . his resume , his letter , 
he 's been applying for jobs and things , 
so that type of thing . forms for his photography business , and that kind of thing . 
i tell you 
once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly . 
my father had a software company , 
and we 're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing , here . 
but they 're kind of older 
so i 'm not sure that we 'll be able to get too many other programs for it . 
i 'm a writer by profession 
i thought i had died and gone to heaven because , i thought , they 're so wonderful . 
i have one of those . 
then 
mine 's broke at the moment , 
ours really needs to have some work done on it 
he does n't work there anymore , 
and once that happened , there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter . 
and so i learned that on there too , 
i have n't . 
i guess i have used it once or twice . 
it 's the one that 's on my father-in-law 's computer . 
that 's probably where you 've used it . 
so that 's the program that they 're using there . 
i have that on my computer here 
and that 's what they have there 
and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and already know the software . 
and i do n't know from my own experience , 
it may be improved by now 
that 's what i 've heard . 
going forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing 
just did n't match with the kinds of keys , you were using . 
and it does a lot of things too that if you do any kind of research or anything like that where you have to use footnotes , it is just wonderful . because it keeps track of all your footnotes . 
that 's neat . 
how wonderful . 
i had heard that that was a better one . 
and it was just awful . 
so i do n't know i think we have just become really spoiled . 
but i think , it 's a nice kind of way to be spoiled . 
i agree . 
clock , 
although i think we 've probably been talking at least ten minutes 
not too much . 
what kind of things do you write ? 
i was a technical writer for many years , 
and my husband and i actually met in a computer company . 
and he was an engineer . 
excuse me . 
but you do n't need to drag it down the hall . 
got a problem ? 
. trying to figure out what all that was about ? . 
that was the majority of my writing 
and for a while i had a partnership in an advertising agency with another woman who is an artist . 
actually i 'm not working anymore . 
i 'm a graduate student 
so i 'm doing a lot of writing 
i 've done a lot of different kinds , 
but i just know right now that i could n't have put out half of what i did 
so that 's been really great . 
so i 'm real spoiled . 
i 'm anxious some day to have one here . 
and they just talked the other day about setting something up again 
so hopefully pretty soon we 'll at least have the word processing . 
my nine year old i 've decided to teach her how to type using the computer , 
that 's great . 
those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on 
and it seems like it 's getting earlier and earlier with the children . 
that 's right . 
so i think that that would be a real , advantage to her to have that and do it early , 
we 've been , writing a story together . 
and i wanted her to put it into the computer , and then print it out and , make a book with it . 
and so i decided if she 's going to do that , it would be a whole lot easier if she could type . 
so we 'll slowly learn just to type here and then put the story in . 
that 's great . 
that 's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life , 
so . might as well start now ? . 
i agree . 
this is really going to be fun i think , 
and my husband is a ham radio operator 
do you have children ? 
i have a daughter . 
do you . 
how old is she ? 
she 's only about a little less than two years old . 
i guess you have not reached the stage where you need to promote a college or anything . 
i 've got one that 's seven and one that 's three , 
so we started saving , 
but that 's all . 
are you planning to encourage your children to go to a particular school ? 
no particular school . 
that you are going to let them make . 
help them make in terms of what they are wanting to do . 
that 's a big influence , i think 
and not only what you can afford , but what 's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are . 
so you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do . 
where did you go to school ? 
it was within the state . 
but it was not necessarily local , 
it was choice between there and a private college that was a bit more expensive . 
at the time , we really could not afford it 
so i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me . 
i enjoyed it . 
did you commute everyday then 
it was a six hour drive . 
when you said it was quite a way away , i did not know that meant you had to drive an hour 
it was like another world . 
did not get home that often , 
and at that age it 's kind of difficult sometimes . 
especially , if you have not been away a lot . 
did you go there straight out of high school ? 
i did not get my degree until later on , 
so i just finished mine a couple of years ago . 
and i guess when you have to do it that way , it makes your choices a lot easier 
that 's true . 
that 's like when i went on to get my master 's it was where i was at the time . 
i was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled 
and i was trying to work . 
so when you are first going to school you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go . 
the computer science center . 
where is that at ? 
north building . 
i see . 
about three years . 
did you work somewhere else , 
sounds like you got your master 's before here 
actually i came straight from school to here . 
i see . 
cause this was the first real job after getting my degree . 
after my master 's . 
i see . 
my undergraduate degree was not in what my master 's was . 
i see . 
so i made a career change basically . 
i see . 
let 's see 
there 's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools just like you said . 
depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford , different things like that , 
so i have not really made up my mind whether to encourage them to go different places 
i like the school where i went . 
and i would not hesitate at all to encourage her to go there if she wanted to . 
or the school where i got my master 's at , which was a different school . 
and i liked it almost as well . 
but you know , that , i 'm not going to hold them to that just because i went there . 
if they want to , that 's fine , 
but otherwise not . although i would get quite a break on tuition . 
because you went there . 
i did n't know that . 
certain schools do it . 
this school does . 
and it was kind of fun , because you are trying to get people interested in your school . 
and there were a bunch of kids and a bunch of schools . 
there were a hundred schools , probably there all competing for the same kids . 
it 's kind of interesting to talk up your , school 
your own school , 
and , i was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of our school . and were interested in it . 
situations like that , you do n't realize until you start thinking about it , the kinds of advantages you school may have over others . 
and so , i was real , real pleased with that . 
that worked out so well . 
did you drum up any interest then 
or that 's good . 
i think so . 
but it seemed like there were quite a few kids that were definitely interested in going there . 
so , there was one mother who came by right , even , before we started , who obviously was very interested in getting her daughter in or having gotten her daughter in or something 
and she was wanting some more information . 
and she was , letting us know how good her daughter was . 
and she had these business cards she was passing out 
and it was quite a production . 
i think some parents go a little bit overboard . 
it sounds like it . 
what was one of the latest ones that you 've seen , actually ? 
i think we rented pretty woman a couple months ago . 
the last two years , i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home . 
i 've become available to come and go more often , 
so i said `` it 's worth it , 
and i can see what i please . '' 
i went about two or three weeks ago and saw f x two 
and that is a really good movie , if you like special effects , 
i have not done that one , 
i do n't know if i have even heard of that one . 
do you know that i do n't follow performers , 
i do n't follow actors . 
some i know , 
some i do n't . 
but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in the one about the old people . 
i do n't know what his name is . 
i think i know who you are talking about though . 
at any rate , i also saw not long ago once around . 
and , that one was just a very poignant story , 
it had people , 
a lot of people said it was a really funny movie , 
but it was a poignant humor 
and it was like steel magnolias . 
the characters played very well off one another . 
and there was humor involved , 
but the story was a very dramatic story , 
and i enjoyed it very much . 
what are some others that you have seen lately ? 
i 'm trying to think , 
that 's one i can watch , over and over and over again . 
i was going to read while it was on , 
but then when it started , i just could n't read . 
that was a really good movie . 
it sure was . 
there are a number of good movies like that . 
there 's quite a few movies out now that i would like to go see . 
and i guess , more than anything , that is why we do n't go . 
you do n't work ? 
i stay at home . 
you are going to have to find a mother 's day out and have him call in sick one day . 
go during the day , 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
there 's nothing wrong with that . 
go in the early hours , 
it 's not crowded 
and that 's the way i do it 
and i go quite frequently . 
if you are going to be planning on doing that , 
and , the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie i was very well persuaded to walk out . very well persuaded , 
there was more gore than i was interested in seeing . 
but , as the movie settles down to a comfortable action i ca n't . 
but the action was comfortable 
and , of course , i enjoyed those good guy , bad guy type conflicts things . 
so , i enjoyed that movie , after the first few minutes of gore . 
and there were some others , 
but they were done a little more tastefully . 
and i could not handle that . 
i said `` i 'm glad i have not had dinner '' . 
even when he 's sad you . 
and then there 's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos . 
i guess , i can wait another month 
and they will be videos . 
i 've heard a lot about that one . 
they say if you really want some suspense , that 's the one to see . 
and , i understand that 's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television . 
i think i read about that too . 
i think it 's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie . 
it 's about time for one of those . 
i want to go see that . 
i 've heard that is wonderful . 
i 've heard it 's wonderful too , 
but it 's just that they are both very long movies , 
and , after that i get involved in other things and do n't want to go back . 
we , rented the other one , 
i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately , 
i guess he 's in there . 
and , i thought that was really good . 
i saw that 
and i can not remember too much about it . 
not defense , 
and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the d a - 's office . 
and then he ended up being accused of it . 
that 's right , 
i remember now . 
i remember . 
so it really kind of had a turn at the end , when you found out who it was . 
i realize that he would like his career to develop , 
but i do n't want to see him in other things . 
but i tell you , 
i do n't know 
i was never into those movies , either . 
i did n't care for the type of movie , 
and i did n't like him . 
but , he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older . 
he does 
i do n't know , 
and , i enjoy those , 
i did n't care too much for the last one either . 
it just was not enough to it . 
what was the last one ? 
i 'm trying to think . 
back to the future then was the last one . 
it was called hard way , where he was an actor , trying to portray a policeman . 
there you go . 
first question , 
do you own your house ? 
we try . 
it 's a big mortgage in the sky 
and someday , maybe , we might even own it , 
but for all practical purposes , i guess we hold the mortgage . 
our name is on the till , 
so that implies ownership . 
no one else has offered to pay for it . 
that 's right . 
i would not object if anybody did . 
really they could move right into the spare room . 
we have had this one for five years now . 
liked the area , chose to stay inside of spring park . 
i do n't know if you have been up here , 
but it is a residential homeowners , association . 
so , there 's a lot of activities , a lot of pluses and common land . 
but we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market , 
it could not possibly have gone any lower 
and so we were wrong . 
five years ago . 
it bottom out about a year later . 
just recently , i would say , 
i would give it two years back , when it was bottomed out . 
oddly enough , two years , 
but , maybe not in your area , 
it was just different areas , 
not in , this area . 
that 's a really nice area . 
and , hold on a second . 
i do n't want to hear you . 
you are being rude . 
whatever you ask or scream when i 'm on the phone , the answer is no . 
do you understand ? 
how does that sound ? 
there you go . 
write that one down . 
there i go . 
it sounded good to me . 
i hate to say how long that will last too . 
this area up here is all custom homes , 
i do n't think that many by the builder that built this house . 
and , we were not the first owners , 
i think we are the third owners . 
so , they just watched the water pour in on the carpet . 
it did not really mean anything to me except , i liked it . 
he builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now . 
but , the houses here in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred . 
and the guy around the corner is being transferred 
let 's see what , 
i think . 
so , i think the high end is definitely somewhere there . 
try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot . 
it could not be , 
because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet , 
just never . 
maybe that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for brand new , 
or that 's pretty much what it was built for . 
it 's got an awful lot of nice things in it 
but i think it 's going to be a long time , if ever , when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really desirable . 
it seems like people go for square footage only now 
the ones that look like brick houses ? 
the one that looks like monopoly apartments . 
i think those are awful . 
i 'm sorry , 
they are huge when you are inside them . 
they are very spacious . 
they are , 
i was in one today . 
because there 's just the two of us 
that 's true . 
but , i have been watching these houses go up 
somebody was telling me , 
i know somebody who lives back there , 
i have always questioned the quality of construction 
when you watch them go up , you are just amazed that they do not fall over . 
and it takes them something like , thirty days to complete a house . 
that 's amazing . 
right now , in fact , even as we speak , we are having a deck put on in back , 
and these guys are phenomenal . 
they are doing such a terrific job back there , 
you pay for it too , 
but it 's really worth it . 
they are doing such a fine , fine job . 
i 'm really excited about it , 
and the house is built around the trees . 
so , it 's real , real shady . 
but , that 's one of the few things that really immediately pays back on return . 
they come down here 
and the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it , for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars , which is probably about what their equity is , that they got out of selling their house . 
must be a dream . 
but , one of the people that was living back there was telling me that his air conditioning bill , per month , last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month . 
and i thought , 
and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here . 
he has no insulation , probably . 
it 's because there 's no insulation in those things . 
what a trap . . 
they show very well unless you have lived in a lot of houses around the area , or looked at a lot of houses around here . 
and you ask the right questions and can research , 
and i think that makes a big difference . 
but , i like this area 
i do too . 
i think if we had to sell now , we could come close to breaking even . 
but , still it 's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that . 
the topic is selecting care for the elderly . 
and i do n't have elderly parents , yet 
what about yourself ? 
it is . 
are they living independently , right now ? 
they are . 
they are . 
have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that ? 
not for them , 
and , they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen . 
and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home . 
that sounds the ultimate . 
unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home . 
even at that point , most care can be given in the home . 
that sound like just an excellent solution . 
you must feel real good about that . 
i felt good about it because that 's my personal feeling also . 
i read a lot 
and then i know people then have visited nursing homes and have had great , grandparents in the nursing homes 
and it was not a happy situation for any of them . 
so there are a lot of activities going on all the time 
and this is a nursing home , 
it 's not a senior citizens home . 
they need , the nursing care , 
but it 's a very expensive solution . 
i think we just listen to , the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes . 
it 's just a matter of finding , a good home . 
and then , of course , there is always the problem of being able to afford either of those solutions . 
and that is what is scary , 
and i also feel that that 's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from . is when people have to put people in a nursing homes 
and they really can not afford the best . 
and that 's right , 
i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation 
and he apparently had not been in the home too long , just a week or so , 
but when the family came in to see him , they had not been made aware , 
i was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance 
so , i told them he strangled on some chicken 
what a shame , 
they put him in the home so that he could be cared for 
and then they could have done that well at home . 
and then she was upset , 
he had on two different shoes , one of which was not even his . 
he had on a pair , of slacks , 
and the wife said `` these are not his slacks '' 
and she said `` i just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean . '' 
you hear these stories , all the time . 
this was just something that i witnessed to . 
and , at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in . 
and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour . 
just by looking at him and the way he acted , you could tell he was in need of nursing home care , 
but the family were all talking about putting him in another home . 
they said he will not go back to that one . 
i 'm glad they have a solution . 
to do that , 
i know . 
i would hate to be in a position where that was all i could afford 
and there was no choice . 
and , it 's just her condition deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home . 
the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from people who have been independent all their lives . 
this was a really neat vital woman 
and you get in a nursing home 
and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space , with someone that you have never known before in your life . 
and i do not know what the answer is , 
but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there 
a lot of it goes down to just money . and family support , 
that 's right . 
if you have family that you can live with . 
visits everyday . 
i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care . 
you would do your research 
and you would go visit . 
visit , 
and hopefully , they would have it so that you could go there anytime . 
suspicious . 
i remember my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died 
and i guess there was not a name for what she had at that time , 
she really was not aware of what she was doing . 
and i can remember she had several strokes 
and the nursing home was right next to a hospital 
and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days . 
and it was just like keeping something . 
books , 
actually i am reading a couple of different books , 
one is , a story , 
it is not a story , 
it came out a couple of years ago 
and i have just now gotten around to reading it . 
i have had it a couple years , 
who wrote that ? 
i do not remember the man 's name , 
and he supposedly was contacted by this guy who had these memos he wanted to sell , 
and it was sort of nondescript for the size of the company 
which , inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected , 
he was a great collector of everything , 
he did not throw anything away 
i see . 
that is interesting . 
it 's pretty interesting work 
that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that . 
and it does not have a real story , or any plot , 
you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on . 
and , they have not made a movie of the week of it yet . 
i have not seen it . 
but it is real interesting , 
i also 
it 's another old book that i happen to have . 
but it 's a real good book that a guy wrote who was a research librarian , 
explained 
and i do n't know if you are familiar with that at all 
and they were lost 
they were . 
and it 's probably real close to what everyone is thinking , now that , they just got turned around and could not find their way back . 
i have not . 
i am sure there is something out there , 
i would like to , too , 
i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years . 
whatever , 
this is one aspect of it . 
of course it is so weird , 
cause no one will ever really know , 
but it 's entertaining 
and it makes you think about things . 
that is for sure . 
that is pretty much for right now , 
that is , what i have been reading . 
i kind of like to read different stuff 
and i like to read a novel every now and then , 
but i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time . 
usually , if i find a good book , i will sit for two days until it is finished . if it 's that good , 
and that was presumed innocent . 
and i just really , really liked the way he writes . 
it 's just , incredible . 
i read that , too . 
i got it right , after it came out . 
and before it actually got big , she sent me this book saying , you might like this , 
this guy is from here . 
and i read it and really liked it 
that is when it really got big . 
that was good , i think . 
and the other book was in the last year 
bonfire of the vanity , 
i have not read that , although , i have heard it is pretty good . 
that was really , really good , 
the movie was nothing compared to the book . 
that is what i have heard . 
i saw the movie , 
i know . 
and we are not talking about that , 
but i like to read gardening books and things like that . just to tell me what to do with my garden 
i do computer work 
and so i have a lot of those . 
so , i spend a lot of time looking through those , not necessarily reading them but , looking through them . 
but i 'm interested in a lot of that , 
but i have got a lot of books that i intend to read , 
but i have not been able to yet for one reason or another . 
what is a book on your list , 
i have a list too 
and i have never gotten to it . 
i do not really have a list , 
cause i just have all the books out , 
i have book shelves 
and i have them all out 
and usually when i am through with one , i will go in and look through , 
i have one now 
and i can not remember the name of it that i got 
i have one 
and i can not remember the name of it , 
it is supposed to be a mystery . 
my son is learning disabled , 
is he ? 
he 's in elementary school . 
and he 's not severely learning disabled . 
he 's being helped . 
but he is being helped . 
he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math , 
and they recently released him from , resource , which i was thrilled , 
i really was . 
i do n't know if you 're , familiar with that . 
that 's something new to me . 
it is something new , 
i think i read about that in the paper . 
it 's wonderful . 
and it 's wonderful . 
he did n't have a problem with reading . 
as a matter of fact , he 's reading on level . 
the problem was his spelling . 
it 's interesting , because i 'm convinced i have the same learning disability that was ignored . 
so you learned how to solve your problems on your own . 
that 's right . 
and so it 's not an intelligence problem . 
it 's just a problem with learning . 
or is this something , 
and then he just did n't learn the right way ? 
it 's funny . 
when he was in first grade , he had trouble with spelling , 
it 's amazing . 
you 'll say to him , spell cat , 
and then he would go to write it , 
and i kept saying to the teacher , something is wrong here . 
something is wrong here . 
you 're right . 
and the teacher kept saying , he has a may birthday . 
second grade it was , 
these teachers as far as i 'm concerned are absolute saints , because in second grade i went up there , 
and i requested a conference because all year long they kept telling me i was crazy . 
that 's great for parents to be involved . 
i was , 
and i went up there the second week of school 
and i said something is wrong , 
and the head teacher , the team leader , was a special education major . 
how great . 
it was 
and , she had picked it up , 
so she was able to zero in . 
she had already picked it up . 
and she said we were going to call you if you had n't called us . 
we think there 's a learning disability 
and we think he needs to be tested immediately , because once the first report card comes in , they , have all these people being tested , 
and she said , i think we can get him real fast . 
and sure enough , they tested him 
and he qualified for the help , 
and it 's been great , 
and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her . 
and to me that 's the same thing . 
it 's like having a child who has a learning disability that 's being ignored , 
this poor gifted child is being ignored . 
but that 's something that parents are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
and this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that , you do have government money to fund , the kinds of programs that these students need , 
and i 'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem , 
they test kids before they take them , 
and , they do n't take them , 
and if they 're a behavior problem , they 're out . 
that 's right . 
and , this is kind of a rejection type of thing , 
i work a nine ten school , 
and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the parochial and private schools 
and they come in 
and their attitude is , `` i 'm a bad boy , '' 
and proceed to prove it . 
so i really hate that for them . 
i , would rather they not have that attitude , 
recently i was in a discussion 
and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools , 
and that was one of the points that i made , is that you 're not comparing apples to apples . 
that 's right . 
but on the other hand , i ca n't necessarily blame them , 
they are a private school 
and they , can do whatever they want . 
that 's right , 
they can be selective , 
that 's right , 
they have the ability to be selective . 
but you ca n't say then , public schools are not as good . 
you 're right . 
and if they do n't , when they reach a certain age , that 's the end of their schooling . 
and , they do n't ever really go on . 
it 's only their top ones that go on , like ours do . 
so that creates a problem . 
and you ca n't compare , because they go so many more hours . 
the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child 's education , and is that child . 
you see that with the foreigners that come here . 
that 's right . 
i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they said that these children , they had to be the best , 
and they put off all social life , all everything . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
is that good ? 
the child is very bright , 
but on the other hand , i feel like my children , who are kind of middle of the road , are more rounded . 
better coping skills . 
i think it 's real important to have friends . 
i think it 's real important to play sports . 
i think it 's real important to be part of a team . 
and so that 's why i said , their childhood is extremely different from mine . 
we did n't do all that . 
and you do n't see the parents encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or , drill teams or band , 
it 's strictly stick to the educational , 
and it 's interesting to see them as they get older , 
then that is the type of adult they are . 
my mother 's side of the family was quite large at one time , 
and they for as long as i can remember , have had a yearly reunion , 
back early on they used to rotate them to different people 's houses , in the family . 
all local . 
it was around there generally . 
that 's where the family grew . 
just from city to city then . 
so . it was a big deal , 
but they tried to centralize it in one spot . 
so , in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year . 
and that usually works out to be pretty good . 
do you go back ? 
i have not gone back lately . 
but i did not get to go . 
is it choice or just business 
not getting to go . 
just the distance involved 
i have a younger daughter now 
it 's kind of hard to get her there , and everything . 
but i am going to , hopefully next year get to go back , cause a lot of the family on my mother 's side , has not seen my daughter , 
do you have brothers and sisters ? 
i have one brother , 
and , is your mother still living ? 
so you go back and visit with her anyway . 
would you not ? 
either way there was family reunion time , or not , 
i usually see her a , couple times a year 
so that 's no big thing . 
relatives , 
my mother 's father 's family had quite a few brothers and sisters . 
so , it was a large reunion of that group from that descendants . 
and at time they all knew one another . 
and now it has gotten that a lot of those people have died off , 
or what we are left with is the relatives of that group . 
the next generation , 
and so it 's not quite as close as it used to be . 
so , i think people feel less of a desire to really go . 
why do you think that it 's less close than it used to be ? 
those were all brothers and sisters a lot 
back around in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up they were all located together , in one small community . 
and when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth . 
the kids of those people who are not anywhere near one another 
and i do not think they feel the closeness that used to be there . which is a shame 
but that 's just how it is . 
it 's dwindling down every year , 
is that just family 's lack of priority , anymore , maybe 
we get so involved in our work lives and just , social lives and so forth . 
i think that 's some of it . 
it 's just the way i think society is now , is that we do not have the extensive family we used to . 
it 's more of a smaller unit , 
and we tend to try to do things with our immediate family , as opposed to the extended family . of people that we may or may not remember or know very well . 
it really makes an effort to , do this anymore . 
it requires a lot of effort to do that sort of thing . 
i used to enjoy going , 
i still do kind of enjoy it , 
but it 's not as many people there that i really , really enjoy seeing . 
it 's going just for the sake of getting together , 
do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that 's in that group ? 
not really . 
my mother 's sisters , 
but i feel closer to them , because i kind of grew up with them . 
but , as for the rest of that group 
not really . 
and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people , the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion , 
you do not really feel that really close to them . 
and it usually goes through me twice a year 
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that 's on the bottom and put your new letter on the top , 
and then that 's the way it 's kept in order . 
about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on 
and when you meet them at the reunion , you do not feel like , i do not know anything about this person . 
you have , read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth . 
that 's a good idea . 
so , you are kind of , half way acquainted that way . 
and that 's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other , i think . 
we tried to start that in my husband 's family . 
his mother 's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago , 
and i said , let 's start this letter , 
my husband 's sisters started it and sent it to us 
and that 's as far as it got . 
i sent it , on to the next one , 
we are real glad we got together because since that time there were only one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left . 
and the sister-in-law died 
and the sister is in a nursing home , 
so , we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago . 
in fact , i 'm still going . 
that 's good . 
so you probably could give some great advice . 
i do n't know about that , 
what 's your interest , 
i see . 
and my area of expertise , it 's information systems , which is a little bit less technical than computer science . 
and i think that 's one reason why i 'm part of this study because i 'm working with voice systems . 
so , good luck . 
i guess we should talk about giving advice , though . 
what type of advice do you think you 'd give to a parent ? 
to a parent ? 
and the kid at that age , especially if they 're going into undergraduate , it seems like they think they know what they want . 
and , choosing from my experience i thought i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want . 
but i do n't know , 
at the same time , you have to decide what is important about the school , 
i know very few people that started in one field and stayed with it . 
i think that 's what you just said having to do more with the size of the school , the environment of the school , 
i think that 's much more important . 
i 'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school , though , that has a number of different types of programs that some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer , 
so if the kid does change , they do n't have to transfer , 
i do n't know , 
they do n't have to give up years of credit transfer and things . 
that 's disruptive . 
and parents hate to hear this , 
because i actually teach college , 
i hate to talk to the parents 
one of the reasons is because , the kid does n't know exactly what they want , 
i think most employers would probably rather hire a three six in history to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration . 
does that make sense ? 
i see what you 're saying . 
i always tell them that you should major in something you 're going to get good grades in . because that 's always more important overall . 
i do n't know . 
give me five minutes . 
you 're at the office now ? 
at work ? 
i 'm just getting ready to go to lunch . 
that 's like what we were saying , though , 
would you advise a private school , or a public school , 
what 's the trade off there , 
i tell you , 
and the public schools here are , pretty good . 
i teach at a public school , actually , 
and i would , 
i see . 
and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged , because their parents are probably college educated , where at the public school , i do n't think as many parents are college educated , 
and i think because it costs less , the kid does n't take it quite as serious , 
it 's the minimal cost . 
but i think you can get a good education at public or private 
but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private , 
you have to look around at the school . 
i think the bad part is that most parents or kids do n't know what to look for . 
i think i would agree with that . 
in fact , i 'm going through the same thing , where in graduate school , i was trying to choose . 
a particular institution might be better for my area 
but it 's the same thing , 
there 's what will the name recognition , get me , kind of thing . 
does it have a big ten football team 
that 's usually the basic criteria . 
it does n't differentiate on my diploma , 
though i would put it on my resume , what program i went to . 
but i think i 'm actually at a smaller program , 
i 'm not at the big college park campus , , 
that 's the big one with the football team . 
so i think you 're right , that there 's difficult decisions there based on name recognition . 
so it 's got big name recognition in this area , 
a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , 
and technical people know that . 
i think you 're right , 
you really have to think about that for the job . 
i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs , 
i was going to be a teacher , 
i was just a high school teacher , 
so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , 
where is that . 
and when i went into higher education , even at other universities , they were n't aware of it . 
that 's important , 
. i think it depends on if you want a regional job or a national job , 
you need that first , job or so out of school , too . 
and where was i at ? 
in going to school , you get taught the things you learn in school , 
but there is also a whole other dimension the growing up while you 're going to school part . 
and they 'll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field . 
depending on your technical areas . 
i could see that . 
and the first three days , 
this is only my third call . 
i tried to make calls two different days 
and i could n't get through . 
i know . 
it just takes a very long time 
does it ? 
i 've been trying to do that , 
and sometimes i just ca n't wait that long , 
i know . 
so i just hang up . because it keeps going through the thing over and over again . 
this is hilarious . 
but i knew as soon as i heard your voice , 
. tell me , 
what books have you read lately ? . 
let 's see , 
i ca n't even think . 
i have n't read any , 
and you 're such a reader , 
i know that 
i do n't read all that much for enjoyment . 
i read a lot for school , 
but i just do n't have much time for enjoyment reading . 
and it was called smart women or something like that . 
i really did n't like it at all . 
interesting . 
because i right away looked at when it was copyrighted . because i could tell by the theme almost when it was written . 
that kind of was kind of a pop psychology time when a lot of books like that were coming out , i think . 
that 's right . 
and so that makes real sense , that that 's when it was written . 
i was n't really aware that she had written anything for adults . 
for her young people , her books . 
and she 's more famous for that , 
but she has been writing for adults also , 
and so i thought i 'll just try this and see what it was like . 
you would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description . 
you know how that is , 
i wonder if she 's written anything really recently , if she 's got anything in print . 
she has , 
because i remember seeing a new book by her that was out , 
and i think it was an adult book . 
but that 's the last thing i 've read , 
and 
let 's see , 
when i was on vacation on semester break between spring and summer 
and i went to my mother 's , 
i read a book that i should have read when i was probably in high school . 
wait a minute , 
wait a minute , 
wait a minute . 
that 's what it was , 
and she really was good . 
but as i say , i was pretty much ashamed that i had n't read something before then . 
because i think i read it in college , or had to read it in high school or college , 
but i do n't remember it . 
i think it was some actress reading it . 
how interesting . 
and so i got that for her , 
and she loved doing that . 
i 'll bet , 
but i remember that was the book . 
and now i think it 's around here somewhere , 
i would n't be , surprised , 
i 'm just going to have to put it , in the car sometimes and listen to it . 
i read that , 
and then i 'm trying to think , 
that 's what i do too . 
and that 's about it , because otherwise i 'm reading so much for school . 
i have just started reading a book . 
it 's for school , 
not a literary journal , 
the first issue does n't come out until next year , 
but 
i 'm doing some reviews of books , to sort of recommend whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal , 
how neat . 
it 's really neat because these are brand new books 
and i got this one , 
most of the stuff is on literary criticism and philosophy , and religion and all that . 
and it 's a biography , that is really interesting , 
that 's fascinating . 
it 's fascinating , 
it really is . 
but it 's so long , 
i do n't really have the time to read the whole thing , 
but i think , eventually i 'll go back to it . 
so it 's a brand new book . 
it 's a brand new book . 
that would be wonderful to read something like that . 
families had just loads of musicians . 
and they just went from generation , probably to generation , just with these all passing it from one to the other . 
that 's right . 
that 's the way it was back then . 
that 's interesting . 
it was just really interesting , 
not only am i reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed , but also because the board of advisers for this journal right now does n't have a really respected name who 's a scholar on music , 
and i 'm supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be in that position on the board 
i do n't know if i want to take that responsibility or not , 
that 's rough . 
that 's real rough . 
so it 's real interesting . 
that 's a neat thing to be involved in . 
i think that 's probably sort of a thing to do in small colleges , 
you see a lot of small colleges doing things , like that , 
because it attracts really a lot people 's interest . 
that 's one way , 
it 's really good public relations for small schools , 
i think so . 
translations , what do you mean , 
i see . 
and the translations are all so different from one another . 
all different . 
that 's interesting . 
so it 's multiple translations of single works 
my work , is just kind of compiling , all that for him . 
that 's great . 
it 's real interesting . 
let me tell you , 
there are days when i would prefer , really doing that . 
that would be nice . 
i do n't know if i 've told you , 
but this is not on the subject , 
does your family normally have a reunion ? 
do you have one , 
on my father 's side we 've really , 
on my mother 's side we 've had several , 
it 's not really on a regular basis , 
but usually sometimes every few summers . 
all the family lives in once place , except for a few of us are scattered about . 
so it 's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together . 
it might be a good time for you to start a tradition . 
i know , 
you could be responsible for that yourself . 
that 's true . 
how about your family ? 
you 're , a pro at this . 
that 's good . 
and all of the descendants of the civil war veterans come together , 
and they come , 
and then where do you meet ? 
all of his direct descendants have now died 
so we 're talking about second and third great children here . 
i took them up until this year , 
they 're grown and gone from home now 
so they take their family . 
but let 's see , 
that would make them , grandfather , great grandfather , great great grandfather , 
it 's a community hall . 
it 's , a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen , 
and you just bring the covered dishes . 
every family brings a dish of some kind , 
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes , that have been handed , down for years . 
we try to stay away from those things which might have salmonella in them . 
that 's good . 
and most of us are very conscious of , sanitation aspects , whatever you 've got to carry for any distance . 
i always , take home baked bread . 
that 's nice . 
that happens to be my specialty for that family . 
i do other things very well , 
but there are others in the family who do them better . 
do they always have the one person in the family who everyone thinks they know how to make this the best , so that 's what they get to cook . 
that 's good . 
so i learned a lot about them . 
i have n't , been to a lot , 
it was an interesting theory . 
it 's all family centered anyway , 
so you usually are living where your parents live 
you do n't have to come home , 
it was interesting , 
i do n't know how valid it is , 
do you have a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every year ? 
we have kind of a core group that serves as , quote , officers of the organization , 
and each year it 's done a little bit differently , because different people serve in those roles . 
we have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member , 
and it keeps the family alive , even though it 's very fluid . 
sure does . 
that 's wonderful . 
and they 're very dedicated to that , 
and it 's been really wonderful . 
it helps you hang onto your roots . 
and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging . 
my husband , on the other hand , was not very close to his family . 
his family was very scattered and very diverse . 
and i got to talking to him , 
i said , how is his nephew doing . 
`` i do n't know , 
i have n't , talked to my brother in three years . '' 
i said , `` how 's your brother doing ? '' 
`` i do n't know . '' 
my son keeps in touch with him , 
but i do n't . 
i said , `` would n't you like to know what 's happening with these people ? '' 
it 's too much trouble . '' 
that 's incredible . 
liked to kill me , because i did n't have that group cooperation , 
i did , it by myself . 
and nobody brought covered dishes . 
we had a great big fish fry , 
and , it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping . 
and we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them 
and i told him , 
we did it that year , 
and then the following summer , we did not have all of the family there . 
we sent invitations . 
we said , `` let us know if you 're coming . '' 
it was when his step father had died the year before , 
his mother was alone , 
and so they came to support her , 
and then one by one , he began to lose family members , 
we had a problem with that . 
and it was difficult to hold them together . 
and then , of course , he died two years ago , 
so that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now . 
i think that 's what happens when they get scattered , 
that was our problem . 
the first major reunion was probably six or seven years ago . 
and so it kind of wound down , 
those people who are at that core group manage to keep the vigor alive . 
they 'll send out news bulletins . 
guess who got elected to the legislature , 
where have you all been on vacation recently ? 
recently , 
my most recent trip was last year , 
is that a nice vacation spot ? 
it was n't really . 
it was to see an old relative . 
so you probably would n't recommend that as a big tourist spot ? 
that would be nice . 
and that was real nice . , 
we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there . 
that would be nice . 
that would be enjoyable . 
that 's , a nice break . 
i have n't been on vacation in a while either . 
that 's always refreshing to get away from . 
so it 's a lot of fun . 
i worked up there last summer , 
so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the , whole summer long . 
that 's nice . 
worked at a camp there , 
and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains . 
so that 's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation . 
my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity , 
and they 've really enjoyed it . 
that 's nice . 
it 's really , really pretty . 
i was a little kid then , 
and we 
we stayed at some park 
and they had a little mountain man who came down the river every night , 
and he would give a little talk about mountain things . 
i think he was n't a real mountain man , 
and , that 's a good family place to go , 
that 's neat . 
and then the river was really nice because it was n't too frightening , 
but it was n't too easy either . 
you learn a lot of skills too , 
that 's true . 
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning . 
that 's good . 
let 's see , 
that 's exciting . 
and that was a great time , because , that 's such a neat place 
and there 's not a language barrier 
but it was really fun . 
i really enjoyed that . 
i 'm probably going back there to work , for a year . 
because she really has a great desire to do that , 
it 's really nice . 
and it was really different being in a big city , 
because i do n't get much into really urban areas a lot 
and it 's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are 
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone , which i thought i would just hate , 
but it ended up being kind of nice because you 're not accountable to anyone . 
you could just , kind of walk around and observe , 
do your own thing . 
i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people . 
and i had a great time doing that . 
it was really interesting . 
that 's wonderful . 
there 's a lot out there to see , 
i know , 
i 'll say . 
i have n't been anywhere else outside the united states . 
so that 's a nice place . 
that would be nice . 
i had a friend from there . 
but i 'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that . 
somebody that knows their way around . 
you 've been quite a few places there . 
we have . 
once you think about it . 
it was just insane 
twelve days where we 'd just stop a city a day , 
and you slept on the train at night . 
that 's great . 
it was strange , 
it was kind of sad , 
that 's great . 
we found one restaurant we were in and got seated , 
and we , finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things . 
what did you wind up with ? . 
that was easy to say . 
we were able to have that pretty effortlessly . 
they kind of guided you . 
and , they were very helpful 
so , it was a pleasant time . 
i 'd love to go back there . 
there 's just not time . 
there 's not enough time to go see everything , and then to afford to see everything . 
i guess that 's why we need to plan for retirement , so when we do have the free time , we 'll have the means to pursue our dreams . 
i guess that 's what retirement is all about . 
that and sleeping late . 
it was nice talking with you . 
i understand that . 
and have a good afternoon . 
you do the same . 
thank you . 
i 'm back on . 
mainly all my children , that kind of thing . 
do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you 're not going to be there ? 
which ones ? 
i tape thirty something , and l a law . 
those are the two i like the best . 
two they 're going to change . 
one they 're taking , off . 
i know . 
it 's going to be history , i know . 
we like l a law . 
we do n't watch thirty something , 
but that 's kind of young for us . 
my husband and i are grandparents . 
so we do n't watch that type of show , 
but we like l a law . 
we like , that . 
i 'm sorry they 're breaking the team up , because we liked all the ones that were on there . 
i know . 
i 'm amazed . 
i 'm not sure i like the new ones too much . 
i was surprised at the ending with all the funny things happening and different things . 
i just wonder if , they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show , since it 's gone on for so long , 
it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things . where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show . 
i know . 
of course , i guess that 's not bad . 
i know . 
is n't that funny ? 
it has n't hurt him at all . 
do you mostly like a story type of thing that lasts an hour ? 
i do n't usually like stuff that continues . 
that 's one of our favorites . 
you do n't have to have watched it last week in order to follow , 
so i usually do n't like that . 
which they do at the beginning of the season , to grab your attention , 
i know . 
sometimes it 's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one . 
we do that sometimes . 
i guess i 'm not into real heavy stuff . 
l a law is about the heaviest thing i watch . 
mostly i 'm into it for relaxation , 
so i like things like golden girls or cheers 
that type of show is what we watch . 
just some of the times they 're continued , 
but mostly they 're just little vignettes . 
a new one we found we really like is that dinosaurs . 
have you seen that ? 
it 's really funny . 
it 's not a cartoon , 
and robots probably . 
but there 's always a moral to each story . 
and what night is it on ? 
we 've only seen it a couple of times . 
and i ca n't remember what day they call it , 
anyway , it goes on , 
and she said no , 
he was running in a wheelchair to hide her , 
and she said , `` you ca n't do that . '' 
`` this is tradition . 
this is what old people are supposed to be , thrown over the cliff . '' 
and he said , `` i do n't understand . '' 
it 's real funny that they give the teenagers as the one that questions what 's going on . 
and then , `` we 've got to do it . 
it 's tradition , '' 
and the son was `` why ? '' 
and so , in the end he does n't throw her over , 
he does n't . 
and , of course , the town thinks he 's just terrible , because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he 's broken it . 
and then we saw one when a teenage boy comes into his manhood , 
they call it the night of the howling , or something like that , 
and they all go out and howl . 
and the son refused to do it . 
he did , 
so he did n't go howl ? 
he would n't go howl , 
how funny . 
it is . 
it 's real interesting to watch the show , 
our oldest grandson is the one that got us to watching it . 
but it moves real fast . 
it 's real short , 
and there 's always , like i say , a moral to it 
it 's just a half hour , 
or is it hour ? 
half hour . 
that 's all there is to it . 
there 's not many half hour shows , 
it seems like that , 
and i guess maybe there are some parts of that , 
but i did n't really see that in there . 
but what i 've read about it , they talk about that . 
but anyway , we 've enjoyed that , 
i like sports . 
i do n't . 
i do , 
and i like gymnastics , and some track and field , 
and i 'll watch snippets of baseball games 
and i just do n't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing . 
i 'm usually either doing dishes , 
or i always have , letter writing , 
i know . 
or i may be working around in the room somehow , 
that 's something that comes from your old age . 
i do n't sit . 
i know . 
who has time ? 
i do n't have time to sit , i know . 
that 's why i do n't get to watch that much . 
i do okay , because the kids are all in bed , 
but before that , there 's not much time . 
or at six thirty i 'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that . 
if our grandchildren are with us , they have to watch that . 
we do n't watch it unless they 're here . 
i like that . 
i 'll watch , game show kind of stuff 
but . 
we 've wound up sending in one . 
that 's something i did n't think that we 'd ever do . 
did you send one ? 
my oldest grandson pulling his tooth . 
he would n't let us pull it , 
how funny . 
and i 'd tell him it 's getting ready to fall out , 
and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open , hoping it would fall out , because he would n't let anybody pull it . 
at least their plans are good . 
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that they 've had some problems with , the recycling on plastic , 
with the plastic . 
i thought that was most interesting . 
i thought it was sad that it started out as a good program . but then people started dumping trash . and the wrong objects in there , 
and that concerned me , that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just did n't want to set at the curb or take to the dump , 
that 's right . 
and , it 's too bad that people have to ruin , a good part thing . 
i guess that 's going to happen . 
a really good effort , 
that 's right , 
i was thinking about the other day , 
i went to a meeting , 
and one of the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling 
and she had this fantastic family effort in recycling , 
and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics , and her aluminum , 
and i thought one person is doing that , 
but my thought was it 's a shame , 
but would n't it be much nicer if we all did it , 
because her effort would have really really been a good example for all of us . 
and we were just sort of talking about it at the time . 
and here we are , 
now we 're doing it on a , city wide basis in communities . 
doing it . 
so it 's wonderful that we 've come that far , i think 
what did she do with , 
was she a group that was doing it , 
or was she doing it on her own , 
i think she was , 
i was trying to remember , 
there were places where she could actually take her things herself , 
and so it was n't something that was being picked up 
and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would . 
but i remember her saying i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that , and a trash can for the other thing , 
and i thought that is wonderful , that somebody does that . 
you have to really want to do it , though . 
because we do the , plastics and the aluminum , and the glass and the paper . 
and , of course , then you try to buy right too , 
and you have to make sure it 's that , 
sure you do , 
we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans . 
is n't that amazing ? 
and i thought what are you complaining about , when you 're only going to get picked up once a month or once a week 
, 
people , i do n't know , they find fault in everything , rather than say this is a good effort . 
rather than work with it . 
i do n't know . 
i know what you 're saying , 
kind of people like that 
and it is . 
it 's for everybody 's benefit . 
so maybe we do n't realize it in our lifetime , 
but you have to think grandchildren , and great grandchildren 
and , what kind of quality of life are you leaving them ? 
it 's on down the line . 
and i have a real concern about that . 
i agree . 
we 've never had much trash , 
i was raised in a big family , 
and gene 's family was n't big , 
but they were n't rich , 
they just used things , 
they did n't , throw things away , before they were used up 
i know , 
i guess i got a good example from my mother , 
because she was always very , very conscientious about recycling things , 
and she is to this day , 
for instance , she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for when she made cookies , 
it would go on that 
or , if she needed , sandwich paper or something , she 'd use that . 
she recycles everything . 
and i have done the same thing . 
my kids get the biggest kick out of that . 
although , they do the same thing . 
i think they give me a hard time , 
but i think they know that it 's the right way . 
they do , 
and when they actually get out away from the home , and have to do their own buying of things , then they say , mom used to do this 
and dad used to do that , 
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that . 
that 's right . 
and pretty soon they 're figuring out that 's not such a bad way to go . 
that 's true , 
i do n't know . 
and i think you just do your part . 
you ca n't be waited on all your life and expect things to always work out . 
this is what concerns me . 
that 's right . 
you 've got to be in a country , 
what we throw away is , a king 's , ransom to most people , 
you ca n't tell a person that lives in a hundred , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need , and all that they could want that they 've got to be careful . 
people did n't like him . 
because he tried to say , turn off the lights , conserve this , do that . 
do those little things , 
and , nobody wanted to hear it . 
that make a lot of difference , 
and , i think you 're right , though . 
or you have to grow up with it being important in your life before the message really takes hold sometimes . 
and i do n't know , 
it 's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things i am even myself , than i used to be , a few years ago . 
and i think to myself that 's crazy . 
i wonder if maybe i need to bring that to someone 's attention , 
and , i 'm seeing more and more of that , 
i think is a good example that even , industry is willing to do it . 
i think the big question too we 're looking at is , would you be willing to pay more for a product , so it can be recycled . 
i think that 's kind of what it 's coming to , i 'm sure . 
that 's right 
and , do we have to wait until all the landfills , are full and there is nowhere else to put our garbage . 
that 's right , 
that would n't surprise me . 
or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean . 
i know it , 
that 's the way we solve problems . 
and it 's sad . 
certainly . 
which is your favorite ? 
your family does n't live close , then ? 
not anymore . 
and that 's one of those things , 
you just have to go once a year . 
i understand . 
basically it sorts out into that , 
i 've only been there once . 
and i 'd love to go back . 
beautiful country . 
beautiful country , 
beautiful people . 
and i 'd really like to go because i 'm fairly recently married 
we had a great time . 
and my husband has been hearing about these people for years 
but he 's never met them , 
so i 'd like to do that . 
but that 's our typical vacation , 
and we probably take one of each every year . 
how about yourself ? 
but this year we 're not going to be taking one for several reasons . 
i 've never , been on a cruise . 
we 've gone on carnival cruise lines . 
we usually book just a month before it 's ready to go . 
and we get upgraded . 
last two times , in fact , we had an outside room 
and it was beautiful . 
what do you do on a cruise ? 
i 've never been on a cruise . 
you do everything . 
you can be as busy as you want to be , or as laid back as you want to be . 
you can sit in the sun all day around the pool , 
or you can take part in the games that they have going on . 
they have a casino . 
they have a massage parlor . 
they have exercise , 
you can do anything . 
and that 's just aboard ship . 
and that 's quite fun . 
we 've been there twice . 
we went but with different people . 
we 've gone with friends each time . 
i see . 
pardon me ? 
but it was wonderful . 
so we really like those . 
we 've been to a few places in this country . 
we still have a lot to see , though . 
where are you from originally ? 
and so , like you , we always try to make it back home to see the relatives . 
we both still have family there . 
and that 's fun . 
it brings back a lot of memories . 
things are different there , though . 
i do n't know . 
it 's just entirely different world than this area . 
so it 's not like i 'm going home . 
did you ? 
and so they 're going very nice places , 
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know . 
they 've been there eight years . 
and i just grab the car and drive everywhere . 
that 's great . 
it is nice , 
but it 's not home . 
this is home , 
and i 've never thought about a cruise . 
it 's so funny . 
as i said , we 've done them three times . 
we 'd be going again this year if circumstances had n't changed . 
we 'd probably go . 
my husband would , 
he kind of likes the casinos a little bit . 
but i like all of that . 
what 's the best part , from your point of view ? 
i like seeing other countries and shopping in other places . 
i like shopping . 
so we 're going to be able to go up there . 
that will be nice . 
so i 'm kind of looking forward to that , except i hate to see them go . 
do n't go in the winter . 
that 's what everybody says , 
so that will be hard to stay away from . 
there are exceptions made for special occasions like that . 
is n't that the truth , 
. that sounds wonderful . 
i guess i would contemplate going on a cruise all circumstances permitting it . 
there 's all age groups too , 
and that 's kind of fun . 
if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals , you meet different people . 
you may meet people thirty years older than you , or younger , 
and everybody is really interesting , 
and everybody is there to have a good time 
they have shorter ones 
and then they have ten day ones . 
but i think seven days is long enough for us . 
by that time we 're ready to get home and get back to our routine . 
and that was pushing it a bit . 
when i spend enough money to go overseas , i , go for a long time . 
that makes sense , 
it really does . 
that 's interesting . 
and his father is a doctor 
and they took time off , 
it was their winter 
and they were having a little break , 
so they took some time off that they could show us around . 
and it is a beautiful country . 
it is beautiful . 
they have mountains . 
we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore . 
that 's really nice . 
and it is gorgeous . 
and it 's just a gorgeous country . 
most people do n't realize it . 
i think if they could get tourists coming to their country , they 'd improve the economy considerably . 
. maybe now things are calming down again . that will happen . 
we really hope so . 
that 's really great . 
as i said , basically all i 've done is go back and forth to parents 
that 's pretty good . 
that 's pretty good . 
and , my husband had a conference in l a , 
so we spent a week in l a 
do you like l a ? 
i 'm very unusual . 
do you do exercise ? 
i do , 
i guess it actually changes , 
i do a number of different things simply walking with my wife 
and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle . 
and then moving up , i run in the mornings , 
not every morning , it probably averages about two days a week 
but it 's along the lines , 
how about yourself . 
that 's a hard question to answer because i do physical things , but i do n't always set out for them to be exercise . 
i walk with my parents , occasionally , 
nothing 's real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule , 
but i have n't since i 've been out of school . 
i do n't have anywhere to do that , 
but that 's going to start soon again 
because i really do n't like to exercise , 
i think that 's the basic point of it , is i do n't enjoy it if i know that it 's exercise , 
but if it 's like a social activity or a recreational activity , i do n't mind 
so i have to disguise it , 
it 's like feeding little babies food and telling them it 's something else so that they 'll eat it . 
that 's right . 
that 's kind of the same thing for me . 
i have to not know that it 's exercise so i can do it . 
so you look at it more as a task . 
if it 's exercise , it 's a task . 
i do n't want to do anything i have to do . 
i see . 
i 'll voluntarily clean the bathroom , 
but i wo n't do it if i have to do it . 
and so , it 's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise . 
and plus there 's a build up of stress 
so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner , 
and i need to go out in the morning and run 
or i 'll just get nuts 
so even though i can look at it as a task , i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying , i 'm lowering my chance of heart attack , and that type stuff . 
eating right and no cholesterol and all that . 
i do all that . 
i 'm doing that more and more than i used to 
i 'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it , 
but it 's still at the task stage . 
is it a pleasure for you , 
something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable . 
i do that at the end of the day , 
during that time the stress from the day goes away . 
i get to share whatever i did with my wife , and vice versa . 
and the running , 
and i enjoy that too . 
year , 
i 've been running since high school on track teams and the like , 
so , running , i 'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you do n't feel your muscles any more 
and you do n't think about the pain of it . 
you take the time to relax some how 
and you think about other things . 
and that 's no fun . 
and it 's so hard to get past that for a lot of people . 
i never got past that stage . 
i think i look better . 
i 'm not a huge person , 
i 'm just a regular looking guy , 
and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is attractive 
so that pays also . 
that 's good . 
so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work with my wife , which is nice , 
i love her , 
i enjoy being with her 
i guess that 's one thing , 
but also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles . 
that 's it , 
i do the occasional push up and sit up . 
because i felt real competitive there , 
i do n't let that bother me , 
but 
that 's something that comes with time , too , 
i 'll tell you , 
the sit ups and push ups are excellent , 
you 're struggling against your own body weight 
you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower , by putting your arms further apart or closer together , by doing them real quick or real slow 
i know in the push up , at least , you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups . 
that 's a good idea , 
but i do have my ride , 
we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house . 
is that right . 
i 'll get up and stair step for half an hour 
that 's funny . 
it 's pretty healthy , 
i need to get started on that . 
maybe not . 
and what 's real funny about plans is that there 's a struggle when you add a plan to your life , 
something else has to go away 
and that 's the hard decision , is , if i 'm going to run in the mornings , what do i trade it off for . 
the answer 's sleep . 
sleep . 
if i 'm going to walk at night , what do i trade it off for . 
and as you get older you have to really think what can go , and what , to replace this thing . 
it 's not just exercise , but anything . 
it 's very hard . 
and i do n't think you should worry about not having a program yet . 
i hope so . 
i think we covered it . 
sounds good . 
you too . 
have a nice day . 
you too . 
and i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a potato dish , 
and we usually serve fresh fruit and then make a dessert . 
that sounds good . 
we 're not real wealthy at the moment . 
and i used my mother 's recipe , 
i really like it . 
i ca n't remember . 
that sounds good . 
it 's good . 
that sounds good . 
and let 's see , 
what else did i serve with that . 
bread , do you have bread to go with it ? 
corn , 
i made french bread with that one too . 
i have a recipe that 's pretty good for that . 
in fact i think i had it at a party once . 
did you ? 
it was good . 
i know people that have served it 
and they say , if you have company coming when you do n't want to be always in the kitchen , it 's easy , 
easy . 
and they said it 's good . 
so , that , always sounds good to me , 
i feel like i 'm in the kitchen cooking a lot . 
i know . 
seems like i cook a lot of dinners not always for company , just for family . 
so , feels like i 'm often in the kitchen . 
not my favorite place , but . a necessity . 
but a time consuming place . 
let 's see , 
trying to think what else i like to serve . 
have you ever had , that ? 
i do n't know , 
what that is . 
i do n't know what that is . 
so you do n't have to mess with spices and stuff . 
and , then let 's see , 
and what you do to make it , you take the shell 
and you spread the beans on first , 
then you put the meat , 
let 's see , 
what 's next , 
then , i usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the lettuce , 
get a towel or go change . 
i 'm on the phone . 
we do n't make it very often , i guess , 
i do n't very often . 
do they ? 
that 's good , 
that 's good , 
or it 's always good on top of something in the sandwich . 
what you want . 
where do they get it ? . 
i do n't know , 
i guess they do n't have it at home , 
i guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe . 
they just said they never had it at home . 
, taking this as a dip , i thought , sometimes when we have it at home , it turns dark on the top so quickly , 
it helps if you leave the pit in it . 
does that help ? 
if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing , especially while you 're waiting before you serve it . 
that 's supposed to help keep it from turning brown so quick . 
i 'll have to remember that . 
and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would , 
that 's good . 
i thought maybe that was the trick . 
that probably helps , too . 
we 've been buying turkey lately , instead of beef , 
do you want it ? 
we have too , 
the ground turkey , the meat is softer 
everybody seems to like it . 
do you want scrambled ? 
so . sometimes it seems to be cheaper , too , 
so we often buy it 
we buy it , 
so we bought that 
and i do n't think anybody in my house knows the difference , unless you tell them . 
i do n't think mine know either . 
in fact , we 've been getting lunch meat that 's turkey , too . 
it costs less than the other , 
i do n't know , 
there 's supposed to be something more healthy about it . 
poultry instead of the beef and pork , 
less cholesterol . 
i guess that 's probably all we need to do for tonight . 
i ca n't think of any other specific things i like to serve . 
i always like dessert . 
i do n't know what you call it . 
that 's good and quick and easy , 
that 's always good , 
probably the only family recipe that we make is cheese cake , 
and we take a recipe from my grandmother 
it 's probably fairly typical , 
are you really ? 
where is it going to be ? 
that 's marvelous . 
i married into the family , 
but this one has been well organized 
i 'm sure location 's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be . 
very important , because you 'll start losing people if it 's too far to go . 
we have factions , when it 's one part , 
i have one reunion on my mother 's side , 
and if it 's elsewhere , other people come 
we never get them at both of them 
never get them at both places , 
so i think we need to find a new place . 
listen , 
they 've had this one , 
of course , over the years it has built up as far as the organization is concerned 
that 's a neat idea . 
and everyone brings in food 
and it really has worked out . 
generally i think it 's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people . 
i guess ours probably is n't that big . 
our family is dwindling , for one thing . 
and i often feel funny because i 'm in a branch that 's all but died 
i just have one aunt and my family . 
and we 're kind of off on the sidelines . 
so we keep going even though we 're not a real big part of it . 
and now we go , 
our children go , 
and our grandchildren are going now . 
that 's great . 
so it 's wound up that we 're the old folks now . 
and they organize a baseball game for the kids 
and several people bring boats , 
and there 's a place they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon , 
so it 's a full day . 
so there 's lots to do . 
so , it has worked out quite well , 
and it 's a chance to see some of the relatives you do n't see all year long except that once a year . 
that 's true . 
that 's neat . 
i think they 're really fun . 
we go to mine regularly , 
and then we go to my husband 's occasionally down in temple , 
and he has a large family , 
so it 's fun when we go to that one . 
so , that 's just too far away . 
that is a problem with the distance . 
and it 's just too much for all of them , all of that group to travel . 
it 's an , all day drive just to get to this area . 
but then we have the same attitude when it 's out , there , although this year we 're going out . 
and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion . 
each year , of course , they elect officers of the family reunion 
we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together . 
and it takes a lot of planning , and assembling of stuff . 
and choose , some place that everybody 's going to like as far as food and all that . 
that 's correct . 
that 's a heavy burden . 
it is , 
i tell you . 
i do n't really care for her to be president again . 
but it 's a lot of fun . 
we 've enjoyed it , 
and it 's good for kids to know that they have other family . 
and this year they 're all excited . 
the show this weekend , 
this weekend 's going to be a rock and roll show 
what fun . 
so it 's going to be exciting for them , and for us too . 
probably lots of laughs . 
there have been some really wild shows put on there . 
they really get into it . 
it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along . 
ours is still kind of loosely organized , 
and the same people usually get stuck with doing it . 
that generally happens . 
and , they do it as a labor of love . 
so , the officer idea is a good idea . 
we 've had various things over the years to raise funds for it 
they 've tried passing the hat , 
and they 've had auctions and various things to raise funds , 
and some people do 
and some people do n't . 
and it 's not fair that everybody not contribute , 
excuse me . 
but that 's the family reunion story . 
a lot 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
been nice talking to you . 
what do you think is the biggest problem ? 
the biggest problem in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that you can throw money at it , 
i do n't know , 
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way because the general values that we 're teaching kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school , 
do you think it 's the values that they 're teaching in school or the values they get from home . 
it 's a lot more , 
it 's socially unacceptable , 
they put a lot more emphasis on athletics 
and i think that carries over to school a lot . 
i think that the biggest problem is with the home environment being part of it . 
i think too many parents expect the school to teach the moral aspects of things to the kids while we 're not going to worry about teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that and then expect them to pick it up at school , 
you 're not going to do that , 
you 're going to carry to school out into the world what you learned at home , 
and i think that that part of that , 
and part of it 's the family , i think , 
and part of it 's the living conditions certain people are subjected too , 
drugs is a big problem now , 
and i think that 's another root problem . 
i wonder if that 's a root problem or not , 
because i think about that a lot , 
and it 's just like , everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now , 
but i wonder , 
that 's kind of side tracked , 
i thought , of course they 're doing better , 
but they still had a better success rate , simply because they started with a lot better raw material . 
i think like you say , it 's the socioeconomic mix 
and they 're not all that way , 
but some that are they 're not quite the same as the kids that are going to the inner city public schools . 
but this was actually inner city 
people were sending , 
just because their kids had the ability and the drive to try and get an education , they did n't send him to a public school , 
like you said , you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you 're pressured not to learn in instance , 
in a lot of cases like that , if kids are going to a public parochial school like that , it 's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education . 
i think it shows that the parents have some desire for the kid to do well , 
and that may be passed on down to the kid as well , 
and maybe they pick up on that . 
and then from the other aspect maybe the school itself has more emphasis on trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , 
they may be able to give the resources that 's needed to do a good job . 
i mean , 
and what would you do to fix the school systems ? 
that 's a tough question how to fix the school system . 
and i think this is happening some around the country in terms of morals , trying to teach the kinds of things that are n't getting taught at home , and respect for other people . 
i think that 's a big part of it . 
if you do n't care about property and people you 're not going to care about learning , 
you 're not going to really care about yourself . 
that 's what i was going to say . 
it 's the chicken and the egg thing . 
i wonder , 
it 's been a while since i been in high school . 
they 're even in grade school when they do that . 
but i ca n't remember exactly what goes through their head when they 're doing that . 
but that 's not an easy task , 
that 's why i say , it 's a tough question what would you do , 
because even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when you 're growing up in a home which may be just the pits , 
and you do n't have any kind of a good environment to live in , 
it 's kind of hard to say , you need to take care of other people 's stuff as well , when you barely have anything yourself . 
i could see where that would be a problem , 
my children as a matter of fact , are all grown now . 
so , i am assisting them with their children in their selections , 
my children are grown , 
but they 're teenagers 
and then i took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool , 
so i am in the child care environment 
i , myself , really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today 's environment than the one on one care is . 
when my children were growing up , up and until they were in the preschool situation , i had them in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids , 
and i felt like that home environment was very important to them . 
it was important to me 
and i feel that they had that one on one that 's so necessary at that age . 
it is . 
in other words , there 're more people , 
they 're dealt with , in packages . 
that 's an interesting point of view . 
seeing the children in the school the way i do , we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as opposed to the ones that have been in the program , that started at twelve months maybe , and were even in there one day a week which is all our school provides for the under three year olds 
but still they have an opportunity to be with other children 
and it is true , 
without a doubt , 
and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center , 
and of course , she had just gotten her degree , 
and she was so enthusiastic , 
and she was excited about it 
and she was going to accomplish all of these things 
however when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time , the pay is minimal 
it is . 
and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really do n't want to make a living for themselves in order to be in that environment , 
that 's right , 
that maybe have another salary in their family where they can do that , 
and that 's what i had the opportunity of doing 
and i could concentrate on the creativity , and really having a lot of fun with the children and providing , them with a great atmosphere , 
they are to be there ahead of time , 
they 're there early to receive the kids , 
that 's right . 
and then it 's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they do n't have cleaning crews in most of those . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
and she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary . 
ours is a church , 
and so we do n't have the expenses of a building 
we share the expense with the church , 
but we do n't have enough 
so it is a lot different . 
my older son was adopted 
so he went into child care at two weeks 
and my younger son went into child care at six weeks . 
so , they were in that environment actually , up until they became seven and nine . 
and at that point i said , they have been given the custodial care that they need , 
and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them . 
however , they 're going out into the school environment now , 
they 're under a lot of other influences . 
i need to be here for them . 
i need to be involved in their school , because i want to be the one who influences the way they develop . 
so i quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their learning experiences and their development . 
you did ? 
well , that 's different than most people do it . 
a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school . 
i know . 
that 's right , 
i just felt very strongly about that , 
and i did not work as a matter of fact , 
my son was in the second grade , 
and he said , mom , do n't do that to me , 
do n't do that to me . 
so i knew it was time to go back to work . 
but i feel very good about spending those years with my boys . 
that 's true . 
and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience . 
it was in a home . 
and she was going back home , 
and i could n't just wait for three or four months and then bring them back to her 
so i had to find a new place 
and i put them in this home , 
so i just took off and went there one day , 
they were not well cared for 
how awful , 
so it did n't take me long to take them out of that place 
but , that 's the only bad experience i had , 
the rest of the time they stayed in la petite academy 
and i was very pleased with their development and their progress . 
they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they did n't learn , 
but they 're going to learn it sometime , 
for the most part , they did have good care , 
and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them , 
however , my older son came home 
and well , she said , kids do exaggerate , 
but she said , let 's go ahead and send him another day , or two days , 
and i promise you faithfully , i will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what 's happening . 
i have a personal computer at home . 
i do n't use it very much any more . 
i used to use it quite a bit . 
what about you ? 
do you own a computer ? 
i sort of own a computer . 
but neither one do we really own . . 
are you leasing them ? 
both of them are sort of work related , 
that 's the nicer way . 
actually i 'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby , 
and my husband 's working at bell labs , 
what brand are they ? 
i 'm jealous . 
i do n't know , 
what kind of consulting do you do ? 
what kind of work do you do when you 're consulting ? 
it depends , 
it 's very different in the different places , 
is it programming related ? 
program related , 
research related , 
and i work in the speech field , 
and i do that type of stuff typically for other people , 
mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that . 
word processing . 
i 'm not familiar with that . 
you can call it word processing , 
but i do n't usually use a word processor to do it 
and we do n't have too much standard software . 
we have n't really bought any commercially available software at all . 
so we do n't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that . 
we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or doing research , looking at the speech signal and then doing writing , and also just as a terminal , 
and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that . 
neither one , 
we have . 
but went out of town for a while , 
and sort of got off the bulletin board and off of my micro completely 
i could turn a computer on , 
so i finally opened up the box and took it out . 
that was it . 
i think that 's the thirty second warning . 
i did n't hear it . 
do you hear , the beep in the background . 
that 's an ambulance or something going on here , i think . 
where are you , 
i have n't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually . 
are you at home now ? 
i 'm at home . 
you 've got a lot of traffic noise real close . 
it 'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal because there 's a lot of background noise that people can hear . 
so it 'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up . 
what time is it now where you are ? 
about twenty after four . 
so you 're an hour ahead of where i am . 
i 'm in central time zone . 
we 're eastern . 
and did you ever try using prodigy or any of those systems ? 
i have n't done that . 
i know someone who has , 
and she 's very pleased with it . 
she told me some of the things you can do , 
and it 's just a very handy tool to have . 
it makes things very convenient . 
you can save a lot of money , too . certainly cut down on long distance charges if that 's what you have in mind . 
i 've never tried using that , 
i do n't know too much about it . 
did you use commercially available software 
i have used word perfect 
not heavy use . 
i 've used d base 
i 've been through three classes 
and i have a great deal of respect for it . 
i have n't done much word processing work with my job . 
i do some 
and the d base work i 've done was strictly class related . 
i 've never used d base , 
but i 've heard both good things and bad things about it . 
it 's got some pretty strong competitors . 
some of them have reviews that are better than d base , 
so , i think by now , it 's a matter of personal taste . 
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use . 
i can understand that very easily . 
i 've had a class on r base and also in paradox 
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to d base . 
do you think d base is more flexible or allows you to do more . 
or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days ? 
i would n't say compatible , 
but certainly comparable . 
i did n't mean compatible , 
i meant comparable . 
i do mainly business data processing . 
i also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility . 
sometimes i get called late at night at home because there 's a production problem , 
what do you think about it ? 
they 're already doing it in the armed forces , where they handle weapons and so forth , 
they do it to prisoners 
so , i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions , 
and i think if , an employer feels that he wants to drug test employees and they do n't like it , then they should not be employed there . 
i would not mind it . 
i especially agree that if it 's an area where they could cause somebody else harm or injury , absolutely . 
and i do n't have a problem at all with employers testing in the hiring process , 
but i do n't have a problem with them too much , testing even after the fact , 
but i do a little bit where it would n't hurt anybody . 
i do n't know , 
sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far . 
unless an employer has a reason to believe that the work competency of the employee is hurting the business . 
and then it 's not a problem . 
number one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft 
it 's not going to be wholesale because of the cost . 
there 's no way . 
but my concern is school bus drivers . 
the train drivers , 
i 'm in education , 
i 'm not even opposed to it for that . 
i 'm concerned in the medical field . 
i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas , too because i consider that a drug . 
i wish they would . 
i wish they would , 
and that is even probably more widely abused by the masses than drugs , so to speak . 
i know . 
and it does n't take that long . 
they do n't have to be totally roaring drunk 
just a little off on their timing could mean life . 
just 
and , our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a pool 
so i 've already been tested once when i was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program . 
but i work with one girl who was tested , 
her name got randomly selected three times in six months 
and i think that 's the only reason i have a problem with it , when there 's no reason to suspect someone . 
control . 
that 's enough to make anybody paranoid . 
that way you ca n't feel like somebody 's out to get me . 
it 's almost like being selected for jury duty . 
so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel , 
that 's just the way it is . 
it could really get out of hand . 
if somebody does observe you at a party using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that . 
to report it , 
personnel , or something , 
i 'd feel really uncomfortable . 
i do n't know what kind of work you do , 
but there would even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way . 
we have a lot of people who work on the line . 
i 'm in accounting , 
they could n't hurt me with their ten key or something , 
but out on the line , they 've got people working some serious equipment . 
put at risk . 
i agree totally . 
and i 'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims are n't due to illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse . 
and in the long run , we 're all paying for that 
so it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that . 
i was trying to remember , 
there was a court case here where i live , just a few months ago . 
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing 
and the city workers took them to court to protest , saying that it invaded the search and seizure amendment 
and it 's still tied up in the legal channels . 
they have n't ruled on whether they can test them or not . 
so i 'm curious especially since a local employer is also already doing it , 
is it , just a small group of the employees that are concerned ? 
it 's the whole city , 
they just do n't want to be drug tested . 
my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested . 
my husband 's retired from i r s agents . 
however , this is n't a problem that we have either alcohol or drug , 
and so , in our minds we 're thinking what 's the big deal . 
that 's the way i looked at it . 
if i had something to hide , it 's one thing , 
you know you do n't , 
so it 's not as big a deal , 
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they 're really concerned about their rights , or whether they 're really concerned about something else . 
and then they say , if you give them the right to do this , then they 're going to take some other right away from you , 
i do n't believe that . 
i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything , 
do you keep a family budget 
i do n't use a family budget , 
my father who is very old has kept one his entire life , 
i probably should have kept one . 
he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out on a very strict percentage . 
interesting . 
we sort of started doing it years and years ago 
and my husband started graduate school , when we were first married , 
and i sort of just got in the habit and never have gotten out of it . 
i can not really say that it 's a formal budget , 
it 's more just a fairly , accurate recording of what i spend , and what i think i am going to have to spend . 
i think it makes much more sense , 
and i have recently gotten out of debt and everything 
and i will probably start keeping a little better , track of it . 
i just spent whatever came in and , never knew what came in and what went out . about like the government runs . 
that sounds real similar . 
so , i think it is probably better to have at least a record 
and that was put over there 
and of course , he is from the depression , 
so it 's his life , 
but i think it would be smart if somebody would keep some sort of a plan that works for them . 
i think you are right , 
it must have been sort of interesting to us 
and it 's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years . , 
it is . 
for instance , 
i 'm a historian , 
i could not believe he did that , 
as a matter of fact my mother was going through some things not long ago . 
and , it was just fascinating to see how little things cost , 
of course , it 's all relative , of course , 
i know . 
for a pair of shoes was like five dollars 
i know , 
i found a record that i had what i had paid for hotels . 
is n't that , something . 
and that 's really crazy , 
cause that 's about thirty years ago . 
that is really something . 
. but , of course , it 's just what the market will bear . 
that 's true . 
if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten . 
that 's right . 
that 's just good old economics working . 
we have tried to instill some sense of budgeting in our kids , 
but our two children are just as unlike as night and day . 
and , our son could care less about a budget , 
and our daughter watches her pennies so closely , that she almost , just sounds like your father , 
she has everything planned so closely , that if , something goes wrong , it just throws her for a loop . 
one , 
the other one may be very careful , 
and she may marry somebody 
and , of course , it would be good because , it you marry somebody a little loose , then she will have that stability of watching . 
you should have one in the house . 
i think that is true , 
and , i think that is probably what happened in our house 
because i think my husband was not quite as good at saving and so on before we got married 
i was putting money aside before i was married when i was working out of college 
and that really paid off . 
because when time came for him to go back to graduate school , we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts . 
that 's about the way it is here , 
if it had not been for my wife , i would have probably been in debtor 's prison , if we had one . 
but , what does you husband do now ? 
he is an engineer , 
so we , had a lot of years of budgeting . 
you have , to do it when , you are in school . 
my wife is still in school getting her doctorate , 
i 'm working on my master 's degree now , 
so , in fact , this last year we had three , 
both of the children were in college , 
our son has a year left 
and our daughter graduated this year 
and i 'm just about ready to finish my master 's degree , 
so we have had once again a real lean year for us . 
i know . 
we had three , in college , plus my wife , 
so that was four . 
you know exactly what it 's like then . 
which you learn , 
that is the best one . 
with education you ca n't , take that away from you . 
that is right , 
it 's one that you can live through . 
so it really makes it easier 
that 's true . 
and , i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life , because that sounds really fascinating to me . 
i am interested in that . 
if i had your address , i would send you , 
i am also in the travel business , 
i do tours 
my husband , and i just went there last year , 
actually we did not take a tour , 
that sounds interesting . 
so you could just holler at me there . 
what is your last name ? 
z e r . 
good , 
i have a couple of sections . 
that 's the guy who hired me , 
. 
wonderful , 
i will look you up in the fall then . 
fantastic . 
it 's been a good type conversation . 
maybe as the summer heat comes along i would sort of like going somewhere where it 's not so hot . and being able to be outside , enjoy outside activities , 
i enjoy playing tennis , 
so i like to have a tennis court there , 
the beach is great . 
a pool is great . 
where do you usually go ? 
let 's see , 
that 's a nice place to visit . 
and we did not have a chance to do that . 
but , i sure would like to go back there and do that again . 
we have not had a vacation in several years , 
so , be our first chance in awhile , 
but i have heard it 's wonderful . 
it 's gorgeous . 
we used to go quite a bit before i moved out here . 
there 's a lot of development of condominiums there on the beach front . 
so they are very , very large condos . 
and , they have quite a few rooms , 
so we will usually rent one for about a week or so . 
and the , beach is nice , 
go down . 
the beach is really nice , is n't it . 
it 's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water , and a , lot of nice waves usually , 
sea shells . 
i am sorry . 
sea shells . 
there 's not as many sea shells along there , 
they have some , but , not so much . 
if you go further down you will usually find some , but not right in there . 
i do not know why it is , 
it seems not to have as many right there . 
but we enjoy it , 
we usually stay at the same place every year , 
and they are , like i say right on the beach . 
where do you stay ? 
we just have not gone that direction yet . 
and it 's called that because it 's at the very end of a jetty there , which is sort of at the end of this little , little point 
and it 's at the very end , 
it 's the last set of condominiums there , 
and it 's very nice . , 
it 's not very expensive , 
i think we are going to go with another couple and their kids . 
and i think it 's going to cost us , per couple , about three hundred dollars for the week . 
. that 's nice . 
it really is , 
because it has got its own full size , kitchen and everything . 
and , this one has two baths , 
the one we got is on the beach side . 
it 's really a nice stay . 
in fact , we stayed there on our honeymoon , 
the particular suite we had gotten was very nice 
and , so we decided to stay . 
but it 's a pretty nice place , 
you will need to try to go and , stay there sometime . 
it 's a little far from here , 
are you driving ? 
we are . 
we are , 
it will take a day and a half to get there , probably . 
the neighborhood that we live , they are switching to an alternate calendar this year , 
what does that mean , alternate ? 
what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation , nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation . 
and in the summer would be more like a two month break . 
and they hope to boost the learning of the children . just the retention of the material for them . 
i see . 
anyway , so maybe within a year , we will see how that falls . 
that 's probably all we need to do today . 
thanks a lot . 
how do you view this whole subject ? 
are you one who feels like you have benefited from the change in roles in women ? 
or what do you think ? 
i think so . 
there 's been a lot of changes . 
i think there 's still a lot to be made , though . 
i think so . 
are you someone who works outside your home , 
has anything in particular changed that you have noticed ? during your time there . 
i guess there 's more women in what would be classified as a man 's job . 
what kind of work do you do ? 
i am in a man 's job . 
but we have got more women in it now . 
there 's a lot of us in it . 
but i thought , i am , not going to do that . 
maybe not . 
so , i was in a lot of classes where i was either the only girl or one of just a very , few women in the class . 
so , that was a change 
and even i did not use my math in my work , 
i became a technical writer . 
but even so , there were very , very few women in technical writing . 
but , that has changed a lot . 
in recent years it has just really changed a lot . 
and i think that the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management , 
but i think they have got a long way to go . 
and i thought that that 's a pretty significantly small number . 
so , there are some strides to be made there . 
but i do not know , 
i think we have come a long way , actually , when i think about when things were like just when i was in high school , and how it is now for girls . 
and i guess my one bad thing is that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities , because , i think she , would have succeeded in a lot of ways , that women were not able to succeed , in her , generation . 
. do you have children ? 
i was going to say do you have daughters . 
that 's always a good question . 
do you ? 
in fact , i have a daughter who just graduated in civil engineering , from college . 
wonderful . 
although there were some other women in her class , she was , one of the minorities , 
females in the class . 
so , she definitely entering into a male profession . 
but , for instance there is the organization the society of women engineers , 
so , that is recognized , as a place where women should be . 
but i do not know , 
i am not either , 
but that is one area that i can see might change , but i really doubt will change . 
not for a long time anyway . 
probably not . 
i was just trying to think . 
i know something . 
tell me what you think about this . 
the role of women in combat roles during the war ? 
because , i know that now there , they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles . 
and the only branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the air force . 
but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job . 
it was real interesting , 
i was listening to some of the comments on television the other day about it , 
i do not know if he was a general or what his rank was , 
very high . 
he said it 's just a personal thing with me . 
i can not tell you why i feel this way , 
but i just would rather have a man doing some of these jobs than a woman . 
i thought , at least he was honest . 
but , that does not sit very well with a lot of folks , i am sure . 
there 's some men out there that are more feminine than most women . 
because , mentally and emotionally , i think women can handle a job and , every bit as well . 
i do too . 
and if she wanted to go to combat , i do not see that they should stop her . 
i personally would not want to go 
i would not either . 
i agree 
but i am sure that there are women who would relish that kind of job . 
so i guess that should be taken into consideration , as well . 
this is an interesting topic , 
having a daughter who has gone into engineering , i sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than i did . 
so , that 's progress , i guess . 
and have you talked with a lot of people in this project 
same here . 
i am not at home a lot . 
i am at work right now . 
i put my work number , 
but , at home the recorder gets my calls . 
usually , i am not there , 
but i probably talked to seven or eight people . 
that 's great , 
that 's good . 
i personally have not made any calls yet , myself , 
it never crosses my mind . 
but i enjoy receiving them . 
that 's good , 
that 's good , 
because i guess i placed all but one or two of my calls . and only because i going to make some money , 
our choir is doing this as a money raising project . 
and so we are doing it to raise money for a large project at church , 
so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that 's not too painful . 
financially painful , anyway . 
that 's wonderful . 
it 's just real nice that way 
so i thought , i will just get on the stick and do it . 
that 's great . 
but i have enjoyed the conversation . 
thanks for calling . 
thank you . 
but we are not living in that world . 
we are certainly not , 
our families have changed . 
families , 
society has changed . 
everything has changed . 
and it makes you really concerned . 
i am glad i raised guys . 
let the world train them what to do . 
but characteristically the women have been in the past trained in the home . 
and i really would be at a loss to raise and train a girl . 
i think i would . 
even raising boys today is different though , because , they are expected to do so much more than they used to . 
used to be they would just go off to work and come home , 
and everything was done . 
and it 's a different world . 
it 's , some good , some bad , 
it 's nice that there 's a choice . 
i have chosen to stay at home , and raise my children . 
and i have a ten year old and a twelve year old . 
and i was a single parent for awhile and worked . 
and that was great , 
and i was able to provide for my children 
and that was wonderful . 
and i volunteer a whole lot . 
and that 's my job right now . 
and i love it . 
i really love it . 
i did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said mom , please do not be involved . 
then i went back to work . 
and that will come . 
i know that day will come , 
and i am looking forward to that too . 
but that 's a different phase in my life , 
and i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now . 
there 's a lot of things that have happened , actually , 
and it 's like oil on top of water , 
it changes 
but it 's never different in a lot of ways . 
women at one time did very heavy physical labor and , were expected to maintain a household . 
you are not beating rugs , 
you are not doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing . 
or we really do develop some health problems . 
so , in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit . 
but do n't you think it 's that way with men too ? 
absolutely true 
that 's true with society , in general , 
but specifically the woman 's role , in society has changed . 
heart disease was characteristic of men , 
and stress disorders and things like that . 
and , i think that that 's a symptom of our society , 
it 's a symptom that there 's a general illness that needs to be healed . 
i do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem , 
but , i do know that in raising my boys , i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you need to get them into music lessons , 
you need to get them , into sports 
you need to get them into this , 
they need to be busy 
and they need to be active . 
and i fought all of those things , 
i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me 
and they will say mom this is important to me , 
i want to do it , 
otherwise , i will guard their ability to have quiet time . 
it 's funny , 
it 's funny , 
it 's funny 
i was really looking forward to summer , thinking we are going to have some time off . 
and that 's the way it is with a woman too . 
and it 's been real busy . 
and actually , today is really as far as i am concerned , the first day of summer . because we have had so much going on the past few weeks . 
and you are right , 
that 's how society has changed , 
the family has changed , 
we find ourselves doing things that , we never did as kids . 
i do not remember , being involved in things like this . 
it 's different , 
i do not know , 
only time will tell whether it 's better or worse , than the way we grew up . 
but it 's just very different . 
of course . 
i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time . 
if you do not have the time to talk to yourself , who are you going to talk to . 
and i guarded my children 's rights for that 
and i think that that 's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do . 
they are sacrificing their time with themselves . 
there 's nothing wrong with sitting and being bored , if you thinking internally , and you are , working on your own self . 
you are finding out who you are . 
but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and , get homework done , 
and where do you find the time . 
. in the first place it 's not your homework , 
it 's your children 's homework . 
and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help , 
i helped them with exactly what they asked for 
and that 's all . 
that 's a part of the problem that women have always had 
and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people 's responsibilities . 
that 's very true . 
and then that way , we have not changed in , hundreds of years , have we . 
that 's right . 
that way husbands are crippled , 
they are intellectual cripples , 
and so are children . 
they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible , for themselves . 
did n't he though . 
but i do not know 
they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems . 
they , are all things to all people , 
that 's very true . 
and that 's never changed . 
that 's very true . 
as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday , who said she has a new policy in her home 
i am having a problem with another member of the family , 
she said i have taken a new stance , 
and i say , no , 
i will not . 
you work it out for yourself . 
and it 's amazing , she said , , 
that 's right . 
and i am supposed to be the one who is going to fix it all and soothe everybody . 
and she said i am not doing it anymore . 
i think that 's one of the things that we have today that is very useful , 
and i think every woman ought to deal with it or , ought to at least be exposed to it , 
we are not talking about strikes or things 
what were you saying ? 
do you work around children when you work ? 
not at all . 
i work with computers . 
with computers . 
but you have friends that have children . 
i have some friends that have children , 
not that many actually . 
i do not really know , 
excuse me , 
does the company you work for have , child care on premises for , employees ? 
excuse me one second . 
not at all , 
in fact my situation is a little bit strange , 
and , i , have just come back and was doing consulting work . 
so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now . 
i hope you can stay as long as possible with it . 
hopefully i can do some consulting work at home . 
that would be wonderful . 
i 'll be able to spend the time with my daughter , and not have to worry too much about child care . 
but i might start to go crazy with it too . 
i miss the intellectual stimulation . 
but at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now . 
i think it does when they are real little 
and they are changing every day , 
and you just miss the little things , 
i do not think i would put her in day care for joint , situation right now , unless it was one other child with a person . 
i would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young . because i think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need . 
that 's right . 
maybe if i needed to work part time four hours a day , i might do that , cause you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time . 
that 's right . 
and only when the infant screams , are they going to go there , 
that 's right . 
and i play with her most of the time she is awake 
and i think that is so important . 
it is important for the bonding that they do it , with the mother . 
and they took infants starting at six weeks , 
and there 's times of day even when the child is awake that they lay quietly and look at certain things 
they deliberately keep the room not real bright . 
and , they have different things they will put them down on the floor , 
and of course , they never have more than five , 
and they will put them down on the floor 
and i think one of them was a little mirror 
and some were just different objects that had a definite purpose for kids , 
and there 's something about their eyes . 
how old is she ? 
she 's two months now , nine weeks . 
and she 's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that . 
and she 's just started that yesterday or the day before , 
so every days are different . 
and i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older , 
a little older . 
so you might have a real problem with that . 
so it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place . 
we are just going to have , to see how things work out . 
but that 's unusual . 
but i am trying to leave her a fair amount , even at this young age , with her grandparents , just to , go to a movie and things like that . so that she is used to other people taking care of her . 
is it your parents or your husband 's parents ? 
my parents , 
so , it 's a little bit harder 
she 's met them already . 
not that she will remember them , 
but she 's met them . 
i have three grandchildren , 
if they were where i could not get my hands on them , i am afraid i would probably go crazy . 
i like that , 
are they all nearby ? 
or you can set up your work program and your husband 's so that one of you is there all the time . 
that 's wonderful for the child . 
and if you do decide to go with child care , you really need to look at what your options are and look at what they offer , 
drop in at times that are unexpected . 
right now the situation is so tight at many places , that it 's even hard to have a choice . 
people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids . 
and i just find that incredible . 
and my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very , very soon 
and so , if i go back to work on a part time basis , i am hoping i can leave my daughter with her . because , , my daughter will be about six months older than hers . 
that would be wonderful . 
it will be a little rough when she is a very , very little infant , 
and so she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day 
and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis . that i watch , their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever , or if she wants an afternoon off . even if she wants an afternoon just to work . and not be bothered , 
we might be able to exchange that way . 
and so we will just have to see how things work out . 
i do too . 
they hire a couple of people 
and parents come down to supervise or , whatever . 
really well trained people . 
and have some kind of program set up , like you say , to stimulate the kids , or educate them in some manner . and have the right toys and the right setting and have , an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule , 
that 's real important to little kids . 
my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet , 
and it 's probably my fault , because i do not have a real schedule now . 
she 's been staying up late at night 
and sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me . 
and that 's a problem , 
society is geared to a day person 
i have another friend whose brother and his wife have done this , 
they stay up until all hours of the night . 
i am the product of as much the changing roles of women as anyone , 
my mother and i were really , first generation divorce in our family . 
and , i was the first one , of anyone that anyone had ever known , to have a divorce . 
my mother was treated very badly by a lot of family members , especially from my father 's side of the family , 
basically we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth . 
it was always my mother 's fault , 
she was not sufficient , 
she just was not good enough . 
what was wrong with her , was she not attractive enough , 
did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest . 
it was that kind of an attitude . 
that 's too bad . 
it was too bad , 
it was really rough . 
that 's sad . 
it really is . 
so that 's so changing , 
some of the changing roles of women in that respect , i have been a product of . 
i was first generation going to college in my family . 
first , my mother had always had a quote career , but always a career in a secretarial position . 
that 's wonderful . 
she was a secretary to a federal judge . 
and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him . 
so , that was a really high status position . 
that 's wonderful . 
she made over thirty thousand , a year . 
that speaks , well of your mother . 
she had high standards . 
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back . 
so i went to college and now since have completed two master 's degrees 
and i am the director of music in a church . 
challenges . 
challenges that have to do with my sex . 
for instance i am just not taken as seriously at professions , as many of the men who are doing the same job i do . 
and the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman , 
they question my authority more than they ever would a man . 
and i have experience with this , because i work both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man . 
so i am pretty aware of what goes on in the church . 
i am done talking . 
do you want to talk ? . 
and i can relate to that , 
i think it 's the image that the woman has in the world , as the lesser of the two . 
always . 
and i think things are changing , 
but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to take . 
and i think we are progressing at a snail 's pace , 
but we are progressing . 
so , that 's the main point is that we are going ahead . 
and i think that in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve . 
and men a lot of them have , come around and have seen , the error of their ways . 
but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change . 
so we have to face that reality also . 
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change , why they can not bend why they can not just accept competent women , 
i have never been able to understand that . 
i guess it 's fear . 
the ones that go along with that , they are sure of themselves . 
and they know that they can be on the same level . 
and they do not have any ego problems that they are fighting . 
and i think that we are going to be on par with them in salary and in recognition , in the long term . 
and i think our problems would be fewer , if we supported each other . and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser , because we are equal . 
men have a lot of trouble with that though . 
in their own peer relationships , they do not treat themselves equal , 
and so it 's really difficult for them to treat women as equals . 
they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower . 
it seems that they are more comfortable that way . 
but it 's just really interesting to me . 
i think . 
but , when he gets angry , it 's always over control issues , 
it 's always over power issues , 
it 's always , you said you were going to do something and you did not do it . as if he is the boss and i am the slave . 
those are the only issues we ever fight about . 
i think it 's just difficult for men to accept women equally , 
even if they want to , they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss . 
dictatorships are real efficient . 
and the women when they are married , they are to be subjective to their husbands . 
and i believe that strongly . 
but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are , with what the subject matter is . 
and i think the issue should be settled before there 's a conflict . 
and i think that can happen in a very wonderful way . 
can you picture that ? 
if your husband did that to you , and you did that to your husband , you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself . 
it 's true . 
so that would be a beautiful relationship . 
it would be . 
and i think there are some people that have done that , 
and i have seen it . 
and it 's just marvelous , 
let 's see , 
we have n't seen that one yet . 
do n't bother . 
it was n't that good . 
it was entertaining , 
but 
i do n't think the general audience would go for it . 
how was that ? 
that was excellent . 
it was just a really funny movie . 
that is one i 've been dying to see . 
at the same time , it had a story line about people trying to find themselves . 
there were parts that were sad . 
it just ran the gamut of emotion . 
but it was just all around entertaining . 
how long did that movie run ? 
it 's still on , to the best of my knowledge . 
but time wise , how long , 
was it two hour 
i think it 's less than two hours . 
we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever . 
that always seems to happen when you rent them . 
but this one , it was fairly long . 
was it good . 
so we really enjoyed that . 
i 'm looking forward to seeing that one . 
that was next on our list , 
i think that i can highly recommend that movie to see . 
good deal 
good deal . 
do you rent movies very often , 
we generally rent a couple a week . 
they get taken up at the store , 
that 's exactly right . 
and with luck , you 'll have one or two that are good . 
most of them are a coin flip . 
, we do n't get out as much as we like . 
we have two children , 
so we occasionally get out to the movies 
but it 's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once . 
quite frequently , we have our grandchildren on the weekends 
and we 'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see 
what ages are they ? 
have you found trouble finding movies for them 
the oldest is nine , 
the youngest is three . 
he does n't really pay attention . 
the five year old does n't have the attention span , either . 
they have been doing that . 
we 've been waiting for a good movie out this summer for the kids to see . 
the last one they saw was home alone 
and they enjoyed that , 
but i missed that one . 
my husband took the kids to see that one 
my wife took the kids to see that one , 
but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch . 
that 's a good deal . 
we saw this movie , 
presumed innocent was the one we rented last weekend . 
let me think if i have rented that one . 
and , how does the story line go ? 
he is a prosecuting attorney 
and a woman prosecutor in there is murdered 
we have n't seen that one . 
and he 's trying to find it , 
but , course , it 's one of these with a twist where it looks like he 's the one that wound up killing her 
and it 's an extremely long movie . 
it 's over two hours long . 
which , 
my wife she likes the suspense movies . 
i enjoy them to a degree . 
i think that 's the one i wanted to pick up the other day , 
and then my husband was n't going to be able to watch it with me , 
so i thought i better save that one for another day . 
save that for another day . 
because i think he 'd like that one . 
you enjoyed that one , then . 
it 's something i think you would enjoy , 
that 's a good one to put on the list . 
it 's like most suspense movies , 
fatal attraction . 
it 's one that , once you 've seen it once you really ca n't see it again 
you know all the story and who did what and when it happened , 
at least i do n't think so . 
i do n't think too many of them are anymore . 
it 's a shame , 
i do n't know , 
i know . 
sit there and laugh , 
my wife ca n't understand it , 
we 've heard about that one , 
but we have n't seen that one either 
so it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies . 
we like to laugh . 
i have a theory . 
i like movies for entertainment . 
i do n't want to go away depressed from watching a movie . 
i agree , 
i agree . 
life 's depressing enough . 
that 's for sure . 
i 've certainly enjoyed talking with you . 
thanks for punching in 
have a nice weekend . 
i hope you see a good movie soon . 
there are certainly parts of town i would not want to live in . 
because it 's the situation 
it is very location dependent 
and we live right outside the city 
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people , though i 'm in graduate school , 
i live here because it 's close to the university . 
it 's really funny , 
the only crime we really see is just the kids being malicious . 
and i think most of that is because their parents are n't around . 
that make sense ? 
something like that . 
or fathers are just missing , 
so there 's no consistency there in the home or whatever . 
there 's no one to tell them what 's right and what 's wrong . 
sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class 
not that we do n't have a certain amount of local problems 
but on the other hand we get the affect of the city 
and the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes . a small number of assaults , 
and they are , unfortunately having murders at a rate greater than one a day . 
and they experience a lot more . 
i think they definitely have more problems in the area . 
what do you think can prevent crime ? 
but that 's which came first . 
basically the problem is in the society and the society 's views 
i think , i agree with you there . 
because it just was not something back in the sixties that i even had to worry about . 
but i think that there is a lot in the society where things have changed , 
i think the drug culture definitely is one of the main problems . 
that make sense ? 
he 's one of the big proponents of that . 
and he was a district attorney before , and a prosecutor before becoming mayor . 
it 's a different viewpoint . 
in a sense i have real mixed feelings on that 
it would certainly be an interesting test 
what happens if we lose worse . 
but the thing is , if somebody ruined their life society did n't try to then save themselves from it , 
they let this person who had ruined it die or whatever . 
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise , we need to take care of people even if they have physically ruined themselves . 
they have induced it themselves . 
that 's true . 
i would certainly like to see a real test of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then do n't use them . 
but i never heard results or anything like that , 
but that was interesting , 
i do n't know , 
the drug culture , 
i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things , not thinking anything wrong with it . 
and , of course , i 'm a baby of the old school 
but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
we worked hard for everything . 
that 's very true . 
but nowadays , there 's so much on tv where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing . 
of course i work for lawyers a lot 
and drunk driving is a good one , 
and 
if you 're going to drink you better have your designated driver . 
in this country , and for example with alcohol or with drugs we do n't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say it is okay under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme . 
and we mean it . 
i think that , the drunk driving has actually , just caught on . 
my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school 
and that was an awful three years afterwards of recovery and the difficulties and everything we did 
his father was even , the police chief of the town . 
but he was uninsured . 
so our insurance paid for everything , 
but it was a very difficult time 
and then later my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a new car 
and they came and questioned us . 
it was an acceptable social behavior . 
very much so . 
those are some important points . 
what does your city have for gun control if anything ? 
i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i 'm not sure , 
and i look at it more from the civil side of things , 
they can find guilt or innocence 
i agree , too . 
i do n't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down . 
i think the judges should , 
or even a panel of lawyers if it got to that point . might be better than just regular civil people . not knowing exactly what things are , from murder on up to tax stuff . 
i 've been on a few juries 
and as a say , i tend to be around civil cases because i 've been an expert witness some , 
and many matters are so complicated that it 's so hard to come up with the fair value or the fair sentence 
and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is the range of possible values or terms or how heinous was the crime . 
when i only do something one , two or three times i 'm hardly an expert on it , 
and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three . 
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime if they 're that lucky sometimes . or whatever the case may be . and may not have any idea of what the standard punishment would be for it . 
and they may have some different idea , 
it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was longer that the punishment did n't fit the crime . 
or not long enough or whatever the case may be . 
i think the judges do have better knowledge of it . 
the only thing i worry about sometimes is if you get somebody in there that has a name , that is the defendant and sometimes , might have more pull , which that does happen . 
we ca n't say it does n't , because it does happen . 
not everybody has the right morals sometimes . 
people can be paid off politically or whatever the case may be 
and sometimes that 's not real fair either , though 
one of the others things that gets me on the juries is that often in the newspaper , i tend to hear two things that go on . 
one is , you often see in the headlines the big numbers . 
and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences , or get changed by a judge or an appeals court 
and that never makes the press 
and so , when you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what 's what because we see the headlines , 
and we do n't have , again , a lot of knowledge , 
so we do n't know what is really going on , what is really the range of sentences or awards that are actually in the end applied . 
also what i do n't think is fair , either , is when you have a rapist , come in , 
but , that does n't make any sense to me either . 
it 's embarrassing and all this other stuff 
and they 're put on like , they were the ones that caused it or whatever , 
but , to me , when you do the crime , then you should pay for whatever you did , 
and you should n't be able to go on the lesser charge . 
i do n't think that 's right because all 's that 's going to do is say , that was a breeze , 
i can go out and do it again and have the same thing happen . 
that 's not right . 
that 's where the role of juries is restricted 
and , i 'm not sure i 'd want to change that aspect of it , 
one is , it 's restricted in the sense that , juries only decide the charges that are actually brought 
if it 's first degree rape , second degree rape or whatever , they only get to decide on that , 
this person has been charged with first degree rape , 
and you can decide guilt or innocence on that . 
it 's what information is presented 
and i do n't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards , 
but often juries hear only a fraction of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence . 
somebody thinks it had , because they 've got it there . 
so the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information . 
do n't they ? 
the oath is to tell the truth , 
they do n't want the whole truth . 
they only put part of it . 
because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the truth . 
that 's just like that old witness game , 
it 's a game kids play , too , 
but somebody did it , just for your train of thought where they showed something 
there were four people , 
and your occupation is teaching ? 
i 'm a substitute teacher . 
substitute teacher . 
it is , 
it is . 
i 'm a substitute teacher , in the same school system we both work in . 
i was just trying to make an introduction , here . 
and i have n't told you i 'm going to be at a different school this year . 
i bet you may dress differently , then , for that . 
not really . 
so i 'm going to be down on the floor with them . 
but , you do n't know at some of the other schools you go to unless you 've been there . 
you try to layer , so you can add or take off . 
subtract . 
i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools . 
that 's one of the things i ask about whether she would allow slacks 
and she said she does n't have a problem with that , 
she just did n't like sloppy dressing . 
and i said , that was okay . 
basically , i wear slacks year round except about once a week i try to wear a skirt . 
and for me sometimes , they even have dress up days 
or they have spirit week that you wear your different outfits 
and you have to have the color for that particular school if you choose to participate in spirit week . 
and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat . 
and you never know that , though sometimes when you 're going in , do you ? 
but because i sort of stick to several schools i 'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and might remember to do it . 
on what , 
so that would kind of give you a clue , i guess 
and sometimes you get the long term stuff 
so you 're aware ahead of time of what 's going on . 
and i do n't know , 
i think about the dress code they have for the kids . 
they put one on the parents , or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties 
and there can be no blue jeans worn 
and they 'll wear it with a nice top . 
and , i do n't know that that looks that bad . 
but , if you 're going to tell the kids they have to dress up , i guess you can tell the teachers that , too . 
i think the elementary school teachers , or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than some of the high school teachers . 
but i think it varies , just so much . 
anything can go . 
but they 're just sort of into clothes , 
and then there 's other departments that are n't . 
and they 'll just wear your common , ordinary whatever you might say , 
there 's a couple teachers up there that do dress up more than others . 
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you 're going there , 
course , it 's a standing joke when the men come in a tie and a suit coat , you say have you got a job interview today 
or there 's usually something going on that , would , cause that to happen 
or you 're going to be observed . 
they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants . 
that i did n't ever understand . 
we 've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period 
they dress pretty good , i would say 
and then they go to their coaching 
and they put their shorts on there . 
change then . 
that 's what i would think . 
that 's what i would think . 
but , they do n't wear their sweat pants or anything . 
those i can understand . 
and that 's hard . 
but , 
i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top 
i do n't think we 'll ever get to that . 
you do n't think so . 
i do n't think . 
i think we 're going the opposite direction . 
i do n't really know if they still do . 
some of them they do 
and it 's not at some of the private schools , 
it certainly makes it easier to dress . 
it 's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run that you do n't have to be concerned about your wardrobe . 
i think it would make a difference at school . 
i do n't think we should be spending time saying somebody 's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts , too short 
it 's a lot of trouble to take care of that . 
and , of course , the kids say , then why bother , 
just let me wear what i want . 
and yet we ca n't to that either . 
i 'd like to see them go to not necessarily a uniform , but saying that they 've got to wear a button down shirt , 
but i doubt that that will come about . 
and then the girls , 
just , 
not , 
i think it does . 
it takes their minds off of trying to compete . 
and then i think that 's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do . 
i do n't think a lot of teachers are very professional 
did you go to college ? 
i did . 
and where did you go ? 
i had gone to a small school growing up , 
and what about you ? 
i am , 
where do you live now ? 
where are you ? 
he had moved , 
i visited once or twice . 
i really like it . 
i love it . 
i love it . 
i really do . 
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore . 
that 's correct . 
i have two daughters , 
but my oldest will be a sophomore . 
and one thing that i did this summer , which i thought might benefit both my daughters is , my youngest daughter got involved in band , 
so she went for a week , 
and it was overnight , 
and i thought this would expose both of them to what it 's like on a smaller college campus . 
and my oldest one just was n't impressed at all with the idea of a small school . 
so i still think the exposure was good . 
what were your selection criteria . 
did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford 
or there 's all of these areas to look at in making the decision . 
and those were several that we did consider . 
my parents certainly did n't push but wanted me to look in the south 
and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one or small group situations . 
definitely . 
and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology 
how exciting . 
and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing 
and i ended up majoring in french . 
one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department . 
they also had a strong language department 
and i 'd always loved working with children . 
and i found that i could n't fit everything in , 
that worked out very well for you . 
but he thinks he wants to be a writer 
and i do n't think that , 
and so he 's used to a bigger size 
large classes . 
and because my brother is there he would have family , close by . 
so there are advantages . 
and they really felt like they were numbers . 
i went from a large high school to a large university 
and i definitely felt like i was a number . 
it is a different feeling . 
but that was my only option . 
i just really could n't look at anything else . 
that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior college , which i did n't want to do . 
so that 's how my decision was made . 
especially today with the cost of college . 
that is a major consideration 
and when you mentioned that , we have friends who have children there who just love it . 
and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are 
and it is a smaller size 
and i do feel like there are a lot of options . 
he hopes to be a writer . 
he thinks that 's what he 'd like to do , 
but he 's really strong in math and science , too , 
and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind . 
does your daughter know what she 'd like to do ? 
she has interests that are just going in all directions . 
and , i do n't know , 
she 's taken a lot of french , 
and she may end up doing something with that . 
and i am a single mom , 
and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married . 
so i 'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake . 
i 'm kind of really putting the practical application and saying , yet , do something that you enjoy . 
by all means , go get that piece of paper . 
do you just have one son ? 
i see . 
it sounds like he 's got some really good strong ideas of what he wants to do . 
and , of course , there is still time , 
but he 's beginning to feel that , as much as he enjoys writing , he wonders if he can make a living at it . 
the weather certainly has been hot 
and it 's been humid . 
it 's not really late into the summer , 
are you native to this area ? 
but , i know the summers get hot 
and this year we really did n't have heavy rains until may . 
kind of pushed the season back a little farther 
and it just tried to rain , 
i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
it 's really august that it happens . 
you get those great big cracks in the ground where it 's been so dry 
and it just gets so dry 
and , the earth opens up . 
i can remember the first year i moved here 
and it did n't rain , 
i moved here in late august 
and you sort of forget how much it did rain 
and coming here 
and then it did n't rain , 
it was just wonderful . 
and so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities , you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather . 
it might rain on your little parade . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
and here it was like , pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime 
and you really did n't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out . 
you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do . 
that 's right . 
what brought you down here ? 
a teaching job . 
i did for a while , 
so , i 'm home with two children , 
new career . 
new career 
i had been down here to visit 
and that 's how it worked out . 
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus . 
it 's a nice place , 
that 's a nice place , though . 
i lived to the west of it . 
i forget the county , 
but where all the lakes are around there . 
sort of . 
i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes . 
it was real close to where i worked . 
it was only four miles to work 
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that . 
in the summer , you feel like you 're on a vacation all the time because you 're right on a lake 
and everybody 's out enjoying the water and such , 
and in the winter time the lakes froze over , 
you could still kind of go sledding and such out there 
but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes . 
there 's lots of really small ones out there . 
maybe a mile , two long . 
that 's enough to do some boating 
that 's right . 
and it was lots of fun . 
that 's right . 
so it 's probably out in that direction , 
but that 's the only one i probably could name after all these years 
but it was just lots of little lakes 
and , of course , it was a little more expensive to live on the lake , 
but i just thought that was grand . 
and i think a lot of people did n't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them , 
but there was quite a few lakes all around there . 
it was almost like you were living on an island 
there was so much water around where i was . 
i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from the city limits 
and it was really nice out there . 
so there were things around there . 
really was pretty nice . 
and is n't that where they have a summer music festival there , too ? 
and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
we did n't do a lot of it , 
so those are always fun . 
so it was nice . 
but then it chipped 
and it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven 
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts . 
it lasted only a few hours , 
by noon it was gone . 
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me , better wait to go to work because the roads are all snow . 
and i was laughing , going that 's a good practical joke , 
they said , really , there 's snow 
and there was , but a very short time 
and the weather got warm so quick 
i know . 
course , when we get an ice storm , that 's not too much fun . 
that 's not fun either , 
our house is kind of on a little hill , 
they just go down the ice . 
and if it 's cold , we say , out you go . 
i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there . 
i think it 's fun , 
sometimes the ice is pretty bad , 
we do . 
we 've got a pickup twice a week that they come out 
and they take it . 
and it 's twice a week ? 
used to be we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up . 
and now they have these large green containers 
but they 're planning on doing it very soon . 
and so that put off the program for a while . 
my kids do . 
do they ? 
put it that way . 
they 've been recycling cans for extra money . 
so that 's been their summer money 
that 's great . 
that 's the way we started too . 
and she had to earn money for it 
so , that 's how she started . 
she started recycling cans 
is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they , weigh it or whatever 
the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans . 
the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling . 
and so we do n't get paid for that 
but that 's okay . 
it 's not that much of a bother really . 
it 's amazing how much plastic you generate . 
i was amazed at how many cans that we got 
because when the kids first went down , i said , that 's great 
and i was thinking maybe i 'd help supplement it when they turned them in 
but it 's amazing how many cans you go through . and how fast they accumulate . 
it really is . 
all that stuff 
and how much we have reduced our waste that we 're generating a week . 
they were real upset 
but they were only picking up once a week . 
and it 's really amazing . 
the other thing he does , that my husband a real stickler about is we do n't collect our grass clippings . 
and we mow once a week . 
more often then that . 
and it 's amazing , 
it 's amazing . 
we do n't collect any of that 
and that has cut down a lot in what we throw out . 
we do n't catch it either , mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard . 
and i ca n't mow the yard with the grass catch on it . 
it 's too heavy . 
so i just mow it and leave it . 
sure it does . 
sure it does . 
it really does 
actually they say that you 're wasting fertilizer if you 're catching your grass clippings . 
it 's amazing . 
i like it better doing it . 
it cuts down on my mow time anyway 
that 's true . 
and you zip through it quicker . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
i really think you 're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it . 
we probably will . 
it 's really not that much trouble . 
we keep a garbage bag in the garage . 
and as soon as we use something we crush it up and put it out there 
they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in 
and it 's really no trouble . 
and i feel like at least we 're doing something . 
i read a magazine article 
it seems like a small contribution 
but it 's not . 
and when you read that you think , maybe it is a big deal . 
what makes me sick is when they show the dump sites and , how big they are . 
and they do n't have any place to put it 
and it just floats in the , 
and that 's really not necessary . 
it really is n't 
if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference . 
it would make a huge impact . 
i , ca n't wait for them to get it started . because it 'll be that much easier for us , 
it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up . 
it 's convenient out here for them to do it . 
what do they pick up ? 
they pick up the plastic , the glass , and the newspaper . 
they do ? 
and do you have to sort that ? 
or do you just put it all in . 
and i guess they do the sorting . 
but they 'll do the aluminum cans too 
but we do n't give them those . 
the kids keep those . 
so you 're doing that now ? 
you 're doing the newspapers and the glass ? 
we do n't take the newspaper to begin with . when , neither one of us are home to read it . 
so we do n't have the newspapers but the plastic and the glass . 
at first , when it first started , it was hard because you 're just used to throwing things . 
my husband would , come home and go through the trash and say , you threw this away . 
he would get all upset 
it 's just such an automatic reaction . 
and now we think before we throw anything away . 
it is . 
it 's really funny . 
once you get into the habit of it , it 's okay , 
it 's just making it a habit that 's hard . 
i know . 
the kids have even got to the point where if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can they 're , do n't do that 
and they go to the sink , 
and they put them upside down , 
they let them drain 
and then , after a couple of days they take them all outside 
and , i put them in a big bag anyway 
and then they dump the bag out 
and then they crush them . 
so that 's their activity thing . to go out there and crush . 
that 's fun . 
that 's a lot of fun . 
that 's a lot of fun . 
that 's great . 
i 'm . 
and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans . 
we 're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis 
and , probably the first question would be whether you 've ever had to go through that process . 
not so much personally 
but my husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother always lived in the same town and took care of him and such . 
they live down in college station where , his parents do too . 
and they put her in a home last year . 
she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to not be able to be in her apartment on her own . 
so they found a place nearby that they put her in last year . 
it was pretty much a physical decision ? 
it 's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point . 
then she was starting to lose memory sometimes which is kind of frightening when she 's in the car . 
my husband 's family are reaching that point 
but it 's so difficult . 
was she in favor of it 
or was she kind of opposed to it ? 
it was n't a very strong stroke . 
it was just kind of all of a sudden she was n't herself anymore . 
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own . 
she never really ate very well . 
it was one thing . 
she hardly ever took care of herself 
and she did n't eat . 
she ate very poor 
bad nutrition on top of it . 
and she got to the point she did n't want to . 
so often i think though , elderly people do n't realize that their diet is that bad . 
i work with a lot of elderly people , 
i 'm a trust officer 
and so often they think they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating very much or very balanced meals . 
she was almost ridiculous . 
she 'd eat ice cream and cookies . 
that 's part of the aging process , that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste . 
it really is . 
she did n't want to cook for herself anymore . 
that 's too much trouble . 
that 's too much trouble . 
did n't want to cook . 
i do that right now , 
and i 'm not near nursing home age . 
although they 've got meals on wheels , which i understand is a really good way to handle that so that at least they eat . 
so as a family you all just visited nursing homes 
or probably in college station there was n't a whole lot of choice . 
i do n't think there was . , 
her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in . 
she was ambulatory 
and so there was a lesser care . 
then she got uh , hip broken 
and then she was n't as ambulatory 
so they were almost to the point of saying she ca n't be here anymore . 
and you know the type of facilities whether it 's a shared room or two separate rooms that share a bathroom . 
all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items . 
that 's a given . 
they 're always saying that somebody 's going to , 
and sometimes the help there does it , i think . 
. so , they , do n't have too many facilities for their personal items . 
very limited space waste 
but at least they all seem to have people that monitor their medication intake and dining facilities , 
go to the dining room and eat some good meals . 
maybe it takes a while for them to say , i 'll be with other people 
adapt . 
i do n't understand that , they do n't want to be with anybody else . 
as i think i mentioned , i was in the trust business 
and i 've seen so many elderly people . 
usually there has to be some wealth involved , which is great , if you do n't make the decisions so late that you 're worried about money 
they 're able to move in while they 're still independent and still social 
and they do group things . 
and then if health or mental capacity deteriorates , they 're able to take the next steps without so much change 
and i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they 've always been in . 
it 's really kind of difficult . 
my aunt 's mother is gotten ill recently 
and they 're saying , we need you to be closer 
and you have , women like that , 
it seems like the women just out live their husbands , but , very reluctantly , 
they do n't get out of the house , 
they do n't socialize 
but it 's my home 
and i do n't want to leave it . 
and it 's the first step in actually accepting that you are failing and aging . 
once you make that step you know that it 's just going to be downhill from then on 
and i 've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change . 
in fact , that 's probably what 's going to happen with my husband 's mother . 
and that scares me the thought of forcing somebody to do something . 
but it 's so lonely , 
they ca n't get out and see anyone 
and it 's hard for someone like me to understand that 
because i think , what do you have there ? 
it 's a house , 
it 's walls 
and it 's furniture 
but there 's nobody there . 
not as independence . 
do n't you want to be close to me ? be with other people . 
i just do n't understand why they , so much want to just stay in that building . 
and there 's no family there , 
they do n't get to see their grandkids , 
they do n't get to see their children , 
they . 
and the quality of life really is n't there . 
it 's tough , 
it really is . 
that 's from the child 's standpoint . 
the child is going , why do n't you want to be close to me and your other family . 
what does that house got attraction ? 
they fear being dependent on somebody . 
i know they 're really proud of independence . 
they fear being a burden to family members . 
my husband 's mother will have major surgery 
and we 'll find out about it in a casual conversation . 
she 'll let something slip 
and we 'll say , wait a minute . 
and that 's it , 
i did n't want to bother you . 
when she got home , who took care of her ? 
she stayed in a temporary nursing home . until she was okay . 
but it 's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her . 
she 's down in temple 
and we ca n't see her often enough to really know what 's going on . 
so , it 's difficult , 
it really is 
and we 're all heading that way 
his folks are in college station 
and there 's nothing to hold them there in college station since they 're retired . 
so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here . 
i guess first of all i could have asked that before . 
do you have children ? 
because i did n't know if that would make a difference in how you felt . 
i think it 's a good idea . 
i think everybody should , put in their time so to speak for the good of the nation and for the good of themselves . 
would everyone grow up and mature and realize what this country 's all about . 
i guess that 's something that my family has always believed strongly in , 
and i had opportunities in high school , to work in some programs 
did you ? 
and i agree with what you said that it benefits the person doing it so much i do n't think they realize 
and i think it gives you a better perspective , on life 
and it gives you a little bit more a glimpse of the real world 
and it would certainly help the country , too . 
i think that 's probably like quite a few things that the kids maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through , 
they did things for people for their communities , for their , families , for their friends , where now , i 'm not sure they really do . 
when they asked the question i thought , that sounds wonderful . 
and then , i wondered if people were unwilling 
but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i do n't think it would stay negative very long . 
that 's probably true 
but even through those groups , do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to ? 
not as much as i remember growing up . 
seemed more common in the last two decades . 
i think that 's probably true . 
i think it 's probably more true , still in the smaller communities then in the larger cities . 
what part of the country ? 
so we 're not far apart . 
so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area . 
i had n't even thought about it being out of the area 
but you 're right . 
i mean a real small town . 
and i think it was real prevalent back then . 
i think people thought more of others than they do now as far as doing things for them and then gaining benefits from it . 
and maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back . if we 've lost some of that 
and it seems in the last decade or two that 's true , 
maybe that 's a way , 
if young people had to do it maybe that would start the trend back because that 's one of the things i always thought was a wonderful part of our country . is helping others . 
i do to . 
i do to . 
i 'm not sure that today 's kids would go for it though . 
i think you would have to start younger . 
i do n't know how young you 'd have to go 
but i think by the time they 're early teenagers anyway , i think it 's too late now . at least around here . 
they 're things even just starting around the home 
little ones can do a little bit to help the family . 
and just watching the parents do things too it can start a pattern . 
there 's always something , no matter how young , 
and then that helps develop that attitude . 
i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more . 
i think this is certainly a possible way to handle it 
that 's something that i think that has been lost in families 
and i think that 's a good place to start again . 
i think it has to start in the families first because if you do n't do it for your own immediate family , you 're sure not going to do it for anybody else . 
when you live in areas like that where there 's so much they do n't realize what a small percentage of the world that is . 
i 'm sure , not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas 
that 's probably true . 
that 's probably true . 
i know our church youth group starts with projects young 
they 've done this for fourteen years now . 
that 's great . 
and they also see that there 's a different way of life and those families are really close . 
every youth that 's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed 
and it 's changed their perspective . 
and that 's just the two weeks during the summer . 
that 's great . 
i 'm glad that there are still some areas that get the youth involved in that sort of thing . 
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes . 
did you have anything else ? 
i guess that 's about all . 
i enjoyed talking with you . 
good talking with you . 
and i hope you have a good evening . 
you too . 
i guess we 're supposed to discuss the school system . 
that should n't be too much trouble for the two of us . ? 
as many years as we 've been involved in one . 
i really feel fortunate in that , even though there are problems , they 're not a lot of problems where i teach . 
but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems with dropouts . 
and sometimes they did n't even show up for class 
and they just did n't come to school . 
that 's really sad is n't it ? . 
and i can not imagine being able to do much of anything when they do n't even come to school . 
just recently in the paper here , were articles about students working . high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades . 
but for those students who are determined to do well anyway , that handling a job was very possible and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors . 
i think so too . 
what are their plans after high school . 
and what 's their home situation . 
the home is the key . 
and the main goal is making money now 
and it may be a survival thing for the family , which you can understand . 
this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now , 
but that the most important thing is still getting your education . 
your education . 
when they said the topic of what 's wrong with the public schools , my first impulse was it is n't really what 's wrong with the public schools . 
it 's what 's wrong with families . 
that 's right . 
it 's what 's wrong with families 
they do n't know what to expect at home . 
they do n't feel secure there , 
they do n't know what 's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex . 
for example that child that was shot . 
how can they concentrate on schooling ? 
i agree with you , 
i think that 's the main problem . 
and schools now are supposed to solve social problems mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security . 
and that 's overwhelming . 
at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids 
and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor . 
and that 's just really not enough . 
it is n't . 
and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school 
and they said , we need more in the middle school because that 's when kids are at a tougher and rougher age and all that . 
i think there has to be at least a counselor 
and we just recently had a counselor at elementary . 
we did n't even have counselors in elementary . 
we have always , though , had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids 
and they divided them up between three counselors 
but for a good while every year they 'd have a different counselor 
and they decided that did n't work . 
they do that here . 
and i think that would give them more security in going to the counselor . 
if they have a rapport with their counselor . 
if they do n't , i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them . 
to change , 
and occasionally that happens . 
but , it is frightening 
because , education is the key to our future 
it certainly is . 
and if we have children who are not getting their education , for one reason or another , then what are we going to do with them ? 
that 's right . 
what 's going to happen to them ? 
or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison . 
and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them . 
that 's no good . 
i 'm on that campus strategic planning committee for my school . 
they have all these different names for things , strategies and all these different things . 
but , anyway , one of the key things was that we believed that the public education is the best economic value . 
then i think they decided to strike economic . 
anyway the point was , what happens when public education fails ? 
will then people go to private schools ? 
what kind of a situation do they get there 
and what kind of state are we in if most people are going to private schools . 
i think one thing that we 'll see is that we wo n't be educating everybody . 
that 's one of the things that we do . 
we try to educate everyone . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
we 're the only country in the world that does . 
and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they 're willing to work and have some ability . 
they can do that . 
i believe it 's something like that , 
it 's worded . 
and i do n't know . 
that 's so important , 
then that helps a lot . 
i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too . 
it 's scary to me . 
really a frightening situation . 
i guess we 're both lucky . to be in situations and schools where we do n't see that . 
my mother was teacher for years and years 
and they 're talking a lot about the school situation there , too . 
shall we wrap it up ? 
i would imagine that we 've talked the amount of time necessary . 
i think we have to . 
so i 'll see you when we see you . 
the reason that i was n't at church 
how exciting . 
is n't that wonderful ? 
that is wonderful . 
what an experience . 
i 'm an old experienced hand . 
i started back when it was n't , stylish to do that at all . 
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two 
and it was a wonderful environment . 
i just wish all kids , if they have to be put in day school , could have that kind of place . 
i see . 
so , it worked well . 
how about you ? 
i have a nine year old and a six year old 
and neither one of them has ever been in , day care for the reason of me working 
but they both went through preschool . 
it 's not hard to find anything that 's part-time . 
so many of the churches have really strong preschool and children 's day out 
half day programs . 
and this is one of the few churches that did it . 
i just could n't hack it . 
so there was real continuity . 
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there . 
so , it was really neat . 
but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love 
that is a big drawback in the , public schools out here to , 
you 're lucky to have an art teacher 
and if you do you get them once a week or something . 
or pay for it after school . 
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art 
is that right ? 
i had no idea . 
but i thought , this makes me angry . 
this is something that ought to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do . 
and with our budget cuts , i 'm sure that 's not going to change anytime soon . 
that 's the only way they 're going to be able to do it . 
and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that . 
so , in some ways the day schools do serve those purposes . 
that 's true . 
put the colors away . 
get the computers out 
which is too bad . 
that 's hard . 
it 's so difficult for them . 
did you have your children in , private care , 
was that in your home or in someone else 's home ? 
until they were two . 
both times they were at our house . 
so you were able to have somebody come there . 
and that was hard too . 
i lucked out with really good people both times 
but i know so many people that are never able to find that 
and i 'd practically give my paycheck away to do it , 
or did you have someone that lived in with you ? 
she did n't live with us . 
and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead . 
so that was a plus from that respect as well . 
i was just listening to a program this morning , 
i guess it was on the home show , 
i ca n't even think of the name of it . 
it 's some kind of advisory board they 've put together for parents and children 
and the doctor that was on there , the pediatrician said i ca n't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care and leaving them there . 
that would be hard . 
they give a lot more leave . 
we have more options now then we did when my kids were born , 
that 's great . 
it 's really neat . 
i 've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week 
or they 've whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint . 
we try to work it with their hours . 
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals . 
of course it 's too late for me 
so i 've not tried them to see how effective they are 
but i think we 're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast . 
it 's amazing . 
and for our age group it 's too late , 
too little , too late . 
but i do think it 's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work . 
two income families are here to stay . 
and i would think since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do the people that work in big business have families 
they have children . 
so , it 's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working 
you retain employees and keep them longer . 
so , i hope it helps . 
it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time . 
that 's good . 
because that 's hard . 
that 's good to know . 
i have a couple of friends that , have found a private home to take their children to when they 're young until they hit the preschool age . 
usually you 'll find a woman that 's keeping six children or four to six children in the home 
and my future sister-in-law 's mother does that too , full-time . 
and i kept finding neighbors and friends 
and they 'd move . 
she ended up being in a different home every year . 
too transit . 
and i finally decided i did n't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move . 
i guess we 're going to discuss food and cooking . 
do you enjoy cooking ? 
sometimes , not all the time . 
i 'm kind of that way , too . 
i enjoy cooking when i have time . 
i do n't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday . 
that 's about the same boat i 'm in , too . 
it gets kind of boring . 
how big is the family you cook for ? 
five . 
we have four , 
and two of them are teenage boys , 
i 'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys , too . 
are they ? . 
and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have . 
we have that problem too . 
but also , now it 's just the amount that they eat . 
it 's just absolutely incredible . 
my oldest is nine 
and he already does that . 
does he ? . 
and i told him he 's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat . 
that 's true . 
and we do it for special stuff celebrations 
and , we have steak 
and he does the steak 
and it 's real good . 
how , 
and that 's our favorite , dinner . 
that sound good . 
i love that . 
my husband really likes seafood . 
so do we . 
and i think that no matter what i do , i do n't serve enough of it , really , to suit him . 
i did n't grow up eating that much seafood 
and so i do n't know , 
it 's just kind of not natural to me 
but i like it . 
and i do n't know , 
it 's called seafood stew 
and it 's really like a soup that you serve over rice . 
it 's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it , is it ? 
i do n't see how you eat that , 
i do n't either . 
it is really good 
and one thing that 's good is it makes a large amount . 
and so usually we eat one 
and i freeze two containers of it . 
then that 's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice . 
but neither of my kids will eat it , 
it defeats the purpose . 
it really does . 
have you made them ? 
my husband makes those . 
does he . 
i do n't know , 
i guess it 's the texture , or something . 
but everyone else in my family does . 
is that what he uses ? 
i do n't know , 
it 's , i do n't know what , 
i do n't know . 
and i 'm the only one including my mom and dad and my brother . 
i 'm the only one that does n't eat it . 
is n't that something ? 
but , my kids love it . 
i was going to say , my kids both eat it . 
i guess that 's one thing that i particularly like . 
but i think it 's good for company , too , 
and i 've made it a few times . 
and you can make a lot at one time when i needed to make something to give somebody to take over to somebody 's house or something else . 
it 's nice when it makes , a lot because you can feed your own family 
what does it have in it ? 
you can use chicken or turkey , 
when i do recipes i just throw stuff in . 
i 'm not real good about measuring 
i do it to taste . 
sometimes those are the best ones , 
but it 's just chicken , 
and that 's it , 
and some hard-boiled eggs . 
that sounds good . 
and that 's it . 
those are good are n't they ? . 
and that 's it . 
that sounds good . 
and it 's filling because of the rice . 
you cook the rice before you put it in ? 
i guess i would now use the new mayonnaise . 
that ? 
that 's really wonderful that they 're coming out with so many new things like that because i told my husband this summer , i love to eat chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that 
i know . 
and now it 's okay 
i used to just put a tiny bit in . 
now , i 'm just putting more and more in . 
i do n't like tuna salad unless it 's got lots of mayonnaise in it . 
and now it 's twelve . 
i know . 
i just think that 's the best thing to have happened , 
i 'm just so excited about that . 
. . 
with my kids i do n't , 
they get enough sugar and stuff anyway . 
mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway . 
and they do n't need any added help . 
so , when we 're here at home with sweets and stuff , we do n't really do that much . 
now when they go to their grandmother 's house , which is every weekend . it 's a different story all around . 
that 's when they , as our family would say , pig out . 
that 's good . 
that 's exactly what it is . 
one of my boys that 's , twelve has high cholesterol . 
have you ever found out about your kids . 
not yet . 
and my other one does not . 
year or so ago he found out 
and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down . and did ! 
he was able to get it down . 
i think it 's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol . 
he 's never eaten any eggs . 
he 's never had anything but skim milk 
and i 've never bought butter and things like that . 
but he just left for the doctor again 
and it 's kind of back up . 
so he needs to be careful again . 
so we 've really been talking about the foods for him to be sure to eat 
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff . 
and so he 's eating an apple a day for the last two days . 
and all that kind of stuff does really help . 
i think we 've probably talked long enough 
not too far away . 
that 's unusual . 
i think all mine have been east coast people so far . 
let 's see . 
social changes , 
social changes . 
what 's that mean ? . 
think we can handle that ? 
there 's plenty of things to talk about there . 
shall i go ahead and push one ? 
you want to go ahead and start ? . 
i was hoping that you would 
that involves a lot of different areas , i think . 
it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , is even more , true today ? 
there is a big difference in the economic status of people although i think that has been true always . 
perhaps there 's less of the middle range then there was . 
it 's like people are starting to give up hope 
and they start out very poor . 
let 's see , 
i have three children 
and we 're home schooling . 
so , things that relate to education , are things that i think about a lot . 
i think that involves social changes a lot . 
for instance , i think the schools are having more and more problems because of things that are happening socially in the world around them and because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home , rather and children being put in day-care centers from very early , 
and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening , such as the day-care centers and things , are having a big effect on the social changes . 
because of the way children are being raised , they 're not learning the values they need to learn . 
and they do n't have the self-esteem that they need to have 
and they do n't have a solid family life that they need to have to confidently deal with the things in the world . 
and i think we 're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang things that are happening 
that is a pretty big change . 
that 's very , young for a baby . 
that 's really sad . 
and they think they have to 
i think that if they really tried , they would n't have to . 
and , i think that if they did n't and it became more of the standard not to that maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home and have a more solid foundation for the kids . 
like you said they might be saving money , 
even if they had to pay more now in the long run it 's going to cost society more to force two people to work . even though it 's higher productivity is short-term . 
that 's right . 
it already costs society much more because of it . 
people have become very selfish . 
they do n't want to stay home with the kids or something like that . 
there are a lot of two parent situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants to do . 
rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment . 
rather than that , she has to have the money particularly . 
or , maybe there 's a small need for money 
so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself , too , 
it 's interesting , 
home study . is that what you said ? 
home school . 
home school . 
you sound busy . 
so you 're teaching them , completely , 
and i think it 's becoming more popular then it has been for a while . 
home schooling 's always been around 
but i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools . 
and a lot of it is discipline problems . 
and you can tell which kids have been in day-care centers . 
it 's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things . that they 've been raised in a day-care center . 
that 's pretty sad because something 's got to change with the schools . 
i think it 's going to , change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else . 
when they 're young , 
the home is the base , 
it 's the basic unit . 
and that 's where it all starts 
and maybe part of that is educating parents better . 
changing people 's expectations . 
i know they do have some classes in high schools and things for kids to give them an idea of what family life is like and that kind of thing 
i guess i enjoy eating out here and there , 
or it 's a good change from cooking and eating at home 
and i guess i like a variety of restaurants . 
and sometimes i enjoy going out having a formal meal . 
and sometimes it 's nice to go out and have a salad . 
something , 
do you usually go out with the children or without them ? 
a variety . 
i like to go sometimes without them 
and , sometimes it 's okay to take them along . 
so it just varies , 
we do a mix . 
sometimes it 's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband 
and it would n't even really matter which restaurant it was , 
just to have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table . 
so i guess actually there are times i even say , do n't sit us next to a table with other children , 
this is our night out . 
but , anyway , where do you like to eat ? 
we do n't have any children 
so we tend to , like to try all sorts of different things . 
and we 're very attracted to exotic food . 
of course , we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that , too . 
and we probably go out one to two times a week . 
which one do you like ? 
it 's been a long time since we 've been in there 
but it 's good . 
i 've heard about it , 
i have n't been in there . 
it 's good . 
my husband had been in there several times 
and actually we went in there for lunch one day . 
that 's one of the things , a good pasta means a lot to me . 
i like different kinds of food . 
you 're brave . 
and once in a while things backfire . 
but we 'll try anything . 
i do n't think so . 
but , we really do enjoy going out 
. even though traditional it can backfire . 
i think we 're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or what attracts us to a restaurant . 
how do you usually find a new restaurant ? 
my husband he 's the ethnic fan . 
i do n't know . 
you know what , 
we read the d magazine 
so do we . 
they often do ratings of restaurants , 
when a new restaurant opens up , they usually send out coupons . 
that 's right . 
and when they say buy one get one free . it 's hard to resist , 
so we 'll go in . 
and very often we 'll , find a place that we like 
and we 'll stick with it 
once they no longer give coupons . we 'll stay there . 
but we 've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons , and the other half through the newspaper reviews . 
we use the coupons , too . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
it 's wonderful , particularly if you have more than two people and you 've got four or something like that . 
it 's very expensive to go out to eat . 
it 's almost a hobby with us . 
sometimes i think going out to eat it 's sort of a recreation . 
just a change of pace from eating at home . 
and do the dishes . 
and do the dishes . 
we 've had experience with that , too . 
it may help their tip , may not . 
what 's your favorite restaurant ? 
we 've never been there . 
you would like it . 
and that 's supposed to be wonderful . 
we 've taken people there several times 
and they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding . 
whether you call it southwestern 
and then i guess it must be seasonal 
and we 've been back , 
i guess it 's in the winter season 
they 've never had it when we 've been back , 
but , you ought to try that . 
it 's very good . 
i would probably like that . 
i do n't know people who hunt 
that 's supposed to be a wonderful place . 
my husband particularly likes that . 
that 's good . 
i 've been there . 
you ready ? 
what have you seen lately ? 
it 's funny , 
when i tried , to make the call the other days , 
i thought , 
i 'm dying to see that . 
it was really good . 
and we all liked it . 
and everyone enjoyed it . 
i am just dying to see it . 
i went to dinner with some friends last weekend 
and i said , i want to see it so bad . 
my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer , on , choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another . a lot of the ones i had wanted to see 
finally , it 's my first summer movie . 
let me see . 
right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on , 
we 're going to the movies . 
she goes all the time 
but i go maybe once every couple of months . 
and when i go , i go see two at a time . 
was that good ? 
we laughed so hard , 
you could n't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard . 
i love comedies . 
that 's the other one that we went to that night . 
was it ? 
and course , growing up on the back of a horse and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was so true 
and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles . 
it was so funny . 
both of them were great . 
good . 
we just laughed so hard . 
they just carried it off , to the tee . 
how neat . 
and we did n't think we 'd have much chance of getting in 
but we thought we 'd try it , 
free movie . 
it was so funny 
we hurt by the time we came out . 
i think it is . 
i think it is . 
cause it 's just a fun summer light comedy , 
especially in the theater it was contagious 
i 'm glad you did that before your surgery . 
me too , because i do n't even know if i could live through it now . 
i 'm getting around real good 
and i 'm just still real sore . 
and today course i went back to work two weeks after 
but i do n't have permanent work . 
right now i 'm working with a temporary agency . 
and so , the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free . 
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed . 
and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day . 
and i went 
and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that . 
and i worked about three days a week ever since , two to three days a week . 
and he said you 're just healing really well , 
i just ca n't get over this . 
he says , in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things . 
if you want to play ball , you can go play ball . 
he says , i 'm not going to say you 're going to feel like playing ball 
but you can if you want to . 
i can just see it now . 
and he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks . 
you 've only got two more weeks . 
i will . 
whatever you call easy , i 'll do it . 
and i 've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it . 
and so , i 'm real glad that we did n't go see those funny ones when i 'm still sort of on the sore side . 
because i think he needs a comedy , too . 
but knew that , 
we 've got a lot of company this summer , which is wonderful . 
we 're really enjoying it 
but some of the different things we 're doing there 's just not enough time to do it all 
and realistically he knew he could n't get them all in . 
it was funny cause he sounded like the critics . 
he said the plot line and the characters are n't real big 
but the fire scenes and that action part is fantastic . 
it was real different then you 'd expect , 
but he enjoyed it 
i went , 
me too . 
and 
supreme . 
was that wonderful . 
it was , 
and we wanted to take him to see it . 
we were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it , too . 
i just thought that was terrific . 
i do , too . 
i think he 's really good . 
that 's not an easy part to play , i do n't think . 
i would n't think . 
my kids are going to their dad 's tomorrow night 
so i sort of think i may go do that . 
that one wo n't . 
do you do a lot of dining out ? 
we do n't although we enjoy it . 
we do it more when we have company come . 
what about you ? 
we do some dining out . 
i do a lot of cooking 
so mostly when we go out it 's my husband and i , 
we do n't go out too often as a family unless it 's a fast-food kind of thing . 
but we do enjoy dining out . 
have you ever been there ? 
i 've heard of that 
but i have n't been there . 
where , about is that ? 
have you ? 
did you like it ? 
i love it . 
and we came up one time when my father was visiting 
and we all ate there 
and their seafood was wonderful . 
it 's fabulous . 
it really is a great place . 
and then they separated 
and , i loved them both . 
i really do . 
i think they 're wonderful . 
that 's our favorite . 
have you been there ? 
but i 've heard that 's really good , too , 
it 's wonderful . 
the only thing is you have to wait . 
you have to expect to wait at least an hour . 
so you have to go knowing you 're going to be sitting there for an hour waiting to get in . 
and , as long as you know that , it 's okay . 
but they have just about the best prime rib anywhere in the area . 
i love it . 
and , my husband really likes their ribs . 
we go in 
and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in 
and then we get there 
and we do n't even look at the menu . 
you know right away what you want . 
i know right away what we want . 
we really enjoy prime rib , too , 
and actually the steak and ale out here we 've gone to , 
and the time we went the prime rib was really good . 
was it ? 
i 've been there for lunch 
but , i 've never been there for dinner . 
and , it was good , 
that 's great . 
that 's , great . 
i 've heard about that , too 
have you been there ? 
but . 
i guess we eat out even less than i realize . 
and i did n't think we ate out very often . 
i had heard that , too . , 
i 've never been there 
but i 've heard it 's real good . 
have you been there for lunch ? 
primarily lunch , 
and breakfast sometimes 
the specials . 
i keep hearing about it . 
i keep hearing the advertisements of it 
and they keep saying it 's wonderful , 
it 's wonderful . 
i have not been over there 
and i 've not been there . 
i have n't either , 
one place , 
and i 've only been there for lunch , 
but i went with a friend , 
i 've been there . 
that was nice . 
it was 
and we both enjoy mushroom soup 
and they did . 
it was wonderful 
and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert , which was a chocolate sack . 
i 've heard of it . 
it 's all chocolate made like a paper bag 
and we shared one , the three of us 
and it was plenty because it was very rich 
but i wished i 'd had a camera . 
it was beautiful . 
i bet it was . 
i bet it was . 
and we took another friend with us 
and it was outstanding . 
it sounds wonderful . 
it was really relatively simple 
but it was good . 
it was really good . 
that 's one of the things that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant . 
i love fresh berries . 
and , their fruits are always exceptional . 
i do n't , know 
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer 's market you ca n't find them like that 
you ca n't find them . 
and i was home a few years ago 
and i was really amazed , 
they were real , real pretty 
but they lacked , the service 
i do n't know . 
i guess there 's so much competition that they , really have to be good . 
and , i thought i would really miss that . 
i would , too , 
because we do n't go out very often . 
and it 's a whole experience . 
of course you want the food to be good 
but the atmosphere and service are important too . 
and in order to survive in this area , i think they have to be good . 
because the ones that are n't so good just do n't make it . 
that reminded me of a place for lunch that 's a little off the beaten track 
but it is wonderful . 
where do you live ? 
where do you live ? 
the air pollution is n't too bad in our area . 
so , we 're very fortunate 
but i know in some areas , it really is bad . 
something we were watching the other day 
i 've never been out there , 
but , it was quite evident that , it was a real brown area 
i have n't either . 
i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that 
and , unfortunately , i think there are a lot of areas that are , that bad . 
particularly in the areas where there are industries where they are burning a lot of coal , and oil more up north , i guess , 
i think it 's a bigger problem . with the car pollution , 
i think air is n't as bad it once was , from the cars , because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area . 
and now they 're doing that 
and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country , that 's the only pollution that 's been there . 
it 's not an area that is industry 
from acid rain ? 
i guess . 
from something that the car was giving , 
i think in the emissions , it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere and form a weak acid . 
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side 
you 've seen what it 's done to buildings even where it 's really bad . 
it was put on by the power companies and , about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was , and there was n't from various kinds of energy . 
and at that point in time , one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain 
you 're making a mountain out of a molehill , kind of thing . 
so , it 's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course . 
a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear . 
i 'm not afraid of nuclear , having had that course because of how the nuclear that they use is not bomb quality , 
and , we 're so strict with all our controls in the united states . the chances of an accident are slight , 
and , it does n't pollute the air at all . 
it 's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant . 
many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants . 
it 's kind of funny because people are just petrified at the thought of nuclear . 
so , i do n't know . 
so , i do n't know what the answer is . 
the best answer , of course , would be solar or fusion , or something clean . 
we 've got a problem on the line , do n't we . 
i get that sometimes , 
my line gets some static . 
i do n't know why . 
and oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal . 
i ca n't hear you at all for all this static . 
usually it 's the other phone i have trouble with . 
it must just , be on the line . 
can you hear me ? 
now i can again . 
i do n't know what the problem is 
and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy 
there are other areas that would be better suited . 
that surprised me because i think , we have a tremendous amount of sunny days . 
it can be used 
and it can help 
but that was a problem that they were still working on . 
it 's still got a long way to go . 
it 's just a possible solution in the future maybe to help in some ways . 
it may not in all ways . 
maybe they 'll come up with fusion be able to control it . 
i do n't know how long that 'll take , 
but , one of these days , 
because that 's perfectly clean . 
it 's just we ca n't control it . 
right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out , 
so , it is n't , 
not at all , 
so that 's not going to work . 
at least not now . 
but who knows what the future will hold . as far as energy goes , 
i think , with solving some of the future energy problems , we 'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . 
i hope so . 
i do to . 
i like to be optimistic , 
i do n't like to be pessimistic about these things . 
we have one earth , to live on 
and we got to take care of it . 
and for the future generations , too . 
and so , if we can raise generations with those concerns , we 'll solve a lot of our problems . 
i know i was part of the me generation where people did n't care . 
, it 's whatever , 
if it 's a problem , forget that . 
not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away ? 
how horrible . 
how do you feel about capital punishment ? 
i am pretty much against it . 
how about you ? 
i 'm pretty much for it . 
we can have a debate . 
we 'll have some interesting discussion , i guess . 
i do n't know , 
one of the reasons that i 'm against it is that i 'm afraid of someone losing their life wrongly , 
wrongfully . 
would n't you want to see them killed for the punishment ? 
but then i thought about it 
and i thought , the loss that i would feel at losing my mother someone else would feel that about that person 
no matter how rotten they were , somebody loves them . 
it would never be equal , 
how about you ? 
maybe there is , 
i do n't know . 
that 's true . 
and he 's never going to be , to me , a functioning part of society . 
i do n't know , 
and for the things he 's done , 
i do n't know , 
i guess it 's either put him in jail for the rest of his life or capital punishment 
or whatever 
and most of the time i hear myself saying we do n't have enough room left in the jails 
and people crime is still climbing 
but i just am scared of capital punishment , i guess . 
you know there is always that chance 
but i guess to some people it 'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever 
i do n't know 
you really throw a lot on the courts , hopefully that they wo n't do that for any situation really . 
especially when it 's so far removed . 
and trying to rehabilitate him , too , 
letting him out again . 
and nobody wants that . 
everybody would be just as scared to death . 
and they 've been releasing people left and right 
and you just think where 's the justice here . 
they 're not even having to serve out what they should be serving . 
that 's true . 
i 'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment 
and that was one of the questions 
and , i guess , they said do you think it should be restricted ? 
because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment 
i guess violent crimes would be the crimes where i can see it making the most sense . 
violent crimes with just malicious intent . 
i 'm not saying i think capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case especially because there are some cases when you just do n't know 
he pretty much confessed to it . 
i really would have a hard time , especially if i was on a jury , not wanting him to be executed . 
hang ? . 
because that 's just awful . 
and what is he going to do to the other people ? 
i do n't know , 
from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live . 
but i do n't know . 
she was off drugs and everything , 
but she said in prison you can get anything . 
you can . 
it 's just like being outside . 
people find ways around . 
and there 's a power structure that you have 
and , for some people who have been there for over , and over , and over , it really is n't , as bad . 
it 's not that bad of a life as it should be for the punishment aspect . 
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation 
and maybe that 's one of the reasons why crime has gone up , because it 's not so scary anymore . 
especially like repeat offenders . 
and what they 're going to be doing when they get out . 
and , it 's really scary . 
i do n't know what the perfect solution to that is 
i could see capital punishment in a case like that . and for other people , too , that do things , like that . 
my wife and i are both participating in this survey 
and she picked up the phone 
and when she heard the topic , she said , capital punishment , 
handed it to you ? 
i see . 
so , she tried to enter her number 
and it would n't work 
so she said , it 's for you . 
but , i do n't know , 
i struggle with it , 
but i really think that in terms of like this , i think that it might not be such a bad thing . because , i do n't know that anybody would feel good if you let someone like that loose in your community . 
i 'm , 
you 'd have to be scared to death . 
maybe , if they had more money or more resources to work more on rehabilitation , 
my favorite type of music is classical music , 
and i enjoy orchestral classical music 
and that 's my favorite type . 
probably the favorite instrument would be the violin . 
i do n't really have a favorite , 
i like everything basically . 
i guess if i had to pick , it would be pop , 
but i like everything . 
so , it 's kind of hard to choose sometimes . 
i guess i enjoy listening to jazz sometime although i do n't feel like i have a good understanding of it , or a good feel for maybe what 's good jazz and what 's not , 
but , i enjoy it 
and sometimes i enjoy listening to fiddle music . 
and we bought his tape 
you lucky thing . 
so , we used to go and listen to them all the time 
and , my parents still do . 
i grew up with a lot of his music , and what not . 
especially my dad , likes a lot of classical music 
and he introduced my brother and i both , to a lot of it . 
you grew up with his children , too , then ? 
sure did . 
small world ? 
we all went to high school together 
and we 're still in contact with each other . 
we all go back to parents ' houses on the weekends , and what not 
i played violin in the orchestra for several years , 
it is a small world is n't it ? 
small world . 
he 's a pretty nice guy . 
most of the time . 
i had to work for him 
and i never would want to work for him . 
life just took different turns here 
so it just did n't work out to do that now . 
so , he 's about ready to retire , 
another year 
he sure is , 
he just became a grandfather . 
i heard that . 
it was really nice 
was it a boy or a girl ? 
he 's a little boy . 
what did they name him ? 
i keep forgetting , what she named him . 
of course . 
it starts with an e . 
i ca n't remember . 
we 've heard them and , liked it real well , of course . 
do you have a favorite instrument ? 
i really like those , 
did you ? 
which was real nice . 
and it was real nice , 
i liked that a lot . 
and it played by itself ? 
somebody played it . 
just by itself , 
just by itself . 
it was real nice . 
i bet that was nice . 
it went well , 
but i did n't recognize the name . 
it was real nice . 
actually , i play the violin in a string quartet that often plays at weddings . 
so i always think it 's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano . 
and , it makes it nice . 
you can say classy 
or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else . 
it does . 
it really does 
and it has such a different sound to it , anyway . 
it 's kind of haunting on some of the notes . 
i like it . 
i do n't know how else to explain . 
it 's a husband and wife team that we 've known for years 
and we try to make contact with them periodically to see what 's going on and stuff , too , 
plus my husband 's real big into music , too , 
so . he does n't play anything , 
but , he just likes to listen . 
my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs 
and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast 
does it offer band , or some of the instruments ? 
my oldest is only nine . 
they have choir that they go to music class that they go to 
but he 's not old enough yet to get into the band yet . 
i think that starts in sixth grade . 
probably . 
but i do n't know . 
cause my brother plays , 
and i do n't know if he 's really serious about it yet or not , 
it 's just one of those things i 'm just going to wait and see if he 's interested in something . 
you got a little ways to go , too . 
just a little bit . 
my oldest is eight 
and we 've , started her on piano 
but , it 's been fun , 
it 's a lot of work to see that she 's prepared 
but it 's been fun , 
it 's been fun , 
i feel like i 've learned a lot about the piano . 
i 've learned a lot about playing the piano . 
and it kind of makes me listen a little closer to the piano when i hear it at other places , or when i see and hear someone playing . 
so , it 's been fun . 
i do n't know if any of mine will be interested in it 
let 's see , 
we keep our paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and , plastics 
are you in the part of town where they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling ? 
i did n't think that anybody had those at all yet . 
maybe they do n't . 
i know that was supposed to be in may 
and i could n't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were . 
i have n't seen any , 
so i thought that it had all been delayed several times . 
so i have no idea what they look like 
and , i 'm kind of anxious to see them . 
i look at our big green containers , 
and i say , they work fine 
it will be interesting to see how well that works 
and i 'm glad the community is doing it . 
it 's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people . 
i do n't know what you saw back years ago , 
pop bottles all had a deposit on them . 
of course . 
that , they did . 
actually , we had milk delivered to our house in glass bottles 
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house . 
and so you just put the empty ones back out there 
and he took them away and put another gallon of glass bottle in there . 
i look back at , my childhood 
and i 'd say they were doing things then that we should be doing now 
it would be nice to see it take a good turn here . 
it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away 
so i hope that this time it stays . 
just , to see stacks and stacks of newspapers is just amazing . 
actually when we go dump our things we collect newspapers , too , and then take them , 
seems like there 's a pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics 
so that 's kind of encouraging . 
i did n't know what to expect . 
but on the plastic i do n't have any habits there yet 
and guess i 'm waiting for the city to push me in that direction 
but , it just seems like on the larger scale that we always talk about in our society that economic strife things 
i guess they will shortly . 
and so outside my little town , we would go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something . 
and i do n't know if there 's a deposit on those or not . 
they 're back to glass , you 're saying ? 
let 's see , 
they 'd be maybe six ounce or ten ounce . sort of a small size 
and we did n't stop and look at them a long time 
and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down sort of a basket type thing . 
the paper carton . 
i had n't seen that in a long time . 
you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do , we were doing 
and , i 'm not really going back to good old days , 
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now . 
it will be interesting to see how , over the next year , this all works out because on the grass , i know your husband does n't really like the paper sacks . 
he does n't like the paper sacks 
but he likes to pick the grass up , too . 
but i do n't believe in throwing it into the landfill , 
but most of us do n't have the sufficient , lot size to do that . 
so i 'm glad the city 's willing to take that on . 
that 's nice . 
i guess they dump it the same place , 
i wonder where they dump that . 
and so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it 
so you just have to kind of keep in separated 
and then who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into , 
they have this day now , that it 's separate from the other trash pick up . 
it 's one thing to send grass there , 
i really have n't seen any movies lately , 
so when the computer picked this one , i was a little bit surprised , 
but , i think i have n't been to the movie theater here in about six months , 
but the last movies that i 've seen were probably on video . 
we rent a lot of videos too . 
i have two little babies 
and we saw one movie recently 
and that 's kind of blood and guts , is n't it . 
i do n't particularly care for that sort of stuff . 
i do n't either . 
he does n't . 
i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part . in the movie . 
i saw sleeping with the enemy . 
i saw it , 
i have n't seen that one yet . 
couple weeks ago i rented it and watched it 
and i was pretty disappointed in it because i was told by several people that it 's pretty scary and intense 
and i was pretty disappointed in it . 
it 's a good movie , 
but , i guess that they built me up too much . for my expectations in it there . 
with all the commercials and everything . 
that 's one we want to see . 
but , we have n't seen that one yet , either . 
i have n't seen it either , 
but i 've heard that it 's real long . that it 's a good movie , but it 's long , 
three hours . 
that 's what i heard , too . 
we 've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
supposed to be his debut in comedy . 
which was an interesting movie , but not very funny . 
i know my daughter saw that 
and she liked it 
did she ? 
it was an amusing movie . 
i guess maybe it would have been better if we 'd have been at the theater as opposed to just at the house watching it with no one else around . 
and , of course , i get to watch all these movies like look who 's talking and look who 's talking , too 
because i have a ten year old 
so , we watch a lot of movies around that category that she can watch . 
my son just turned two 
i did n't hear that was coming out . 
it 's fixing to come out on video 
and i ca n't think of the other one that 's fixing to come out . 
they just had the rescuers movie 
i think i heard that was just out . 
he does n't sit still for the whole movie , yet , 
but he likes to listen to the music and stuff if there 's a lot of that in the movie . 
i 'm glad to know that there 's somebody else out there that does n't get to go to the movie theater . 
i tell you , 
my kids are just small babies 
and , i tell you , 
we really want to go a lot 
the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it . sometimes . 
that 's right . 
and then they go to the dollar movies . 
that seems to happen . 
and someone said that was a lot of fun to go do . 
you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie . 
i thought that might be kind of fun to do . 
that does sound fun . 
definitely . 
but 
i 'd really like to get out to the movies more often . 
course , it 's so expensive , now , too that you ca n't hardly afford it . 
i know we get discount tickets where my husband works , 
but , other than that it just seems like it 's so expensive . 
you almost ca n't afford to do it . no matter what . 
that 's right . 
we went on vacation couple months ago , 
that was fun . 
i do n't think that i 've ever heard of that movie . 
that 's the one where they burn down the house or something 
that 's the one . 
i just forgot the title of it . 
. it 's supposed to be a real scary one . 
here 's another one that i 've seen . 
i ca n't remember the title of it , either . 
must have left an impression . 
seems to be a topic that 's going to probably take about a generation to catch on or maybe a generation to two . 
and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up . 
it does seem to be a lot of habits to break . 
i was n't raised as a kid on it , 
but my kids are 
and so they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do , 
and we were doing all right there until the price dropped out 
and they were n't worth anything anymore . 
it took us , almost a year to get a garbage sack full . 
we just do n't drink that many . 
so as far as at home use we 'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something 
and we came out with about a dollar , 
it just really was n't worth it . 
of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old . 
that was a big deal , 
but we decided it was n't worth us keeping it 
so occasionally i 'll bring whatever i 've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there . 
least it gets back into the system , 
but , as far as a habit at the house , i have n't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up . 
have you all got the individual containers yet ? 
i 'm not sure all what we 're going to have to do , whether we have three separate containers , 
i really do n't understand that part on what they 've told you to separate everything . 
if i recall , it 's been a long time . 
they 're way behind schedule on that particular part of it . 
they were fine on the big green containers 
the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor , 
so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than having a household try it . 
but i do n't know , 
that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week 's worth of trash for a house . 
that 's true . 
i was brought up long time ago , that they did n't even have cans . 
they had bottles 
and you 'd return them to the grocery store 
and you 'd get our money back 
and that was all well and good . 
they do n't seem to still be doing that . 
if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass , 
but , i guess this day and age they do n't . 
they do n't do that . 
we live next to a set of railroad tracks 
and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to break them , 
but they were n't that successful , 
so there were a lot of bottles to be returned 
and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day 
i think kids do n't appreciate , maybe the value of money , that it 's so little that they do n't care , 
they can get more somewhere else . 
i wonder , 
and we are crushing cans 
so i would say in the last three years , we 've probably used a lot more cans than ever before . 
where do you take your cans ? 
as you say , it takes a while to build it up . 
do you subscribe to magazines yourself ? 
i do n't subscribe to any magazines at home , because we get so many at work that i need to read that , i just do n't take any at home . 
i see . 
of course , anything that appeals to the homemaker since that 's my main line of interest . 
and then once in a while i 'll pick up a working woman or something and realize why i do n't want to go back to work . what i enjoy about staying home . 
of course , i 'm one of those that does two things at once , 
and i like them because they 're kind of short and to the subject . 
and then you stopped them all . 
but 
the subscriptions ran out 
and i never renewed them . 
and i found that i really did n't have time at home since i work , to read them . 
and then i kind of get turned off by it . other than good housekeeping . 
good housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for when i really have time and i really want to read something . 
i do n't get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with on a general basis , 
and we travel a lot 
so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various different ones . 
and i get into newspapers , 
so i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am . 
i read it fast and put it down . 
and if something caught my eye , then i might read something , 
but otherwise than that they were not too useful to me 
that 's what i do . 
i got some good recipes from them sometimes , 
you clip recipes 
and you save them forever 
and you never really use them . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
and then every so often you weed through them 
and you think , where did i ever put that recipe . 
but that 's mainly my whole idea on short subject reading and things like this . 
i subscribe , like i said , to a few 
and once in a while i buy that new magazine called first on the newsstands or something like that . 
since i work with computers during my work , i have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything . 
i can see that it will be a very long time , probably , before i subscribe to any magazines at home . 
sometimes , if you 're in public transportation i know that people will read them on something like that . 
i can just dump them at the other end , 
and i do n't have to carry them back with me . 
that 's right . 
i do that when we travel . 
no matter what it is , 
air travel or anything 
that 's when you really have time . 
i got into computer work somewhat , 
we have our own computer system at home 
and i tried reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it 
and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as i went along . 
it was kind of a little bit more than what i needed , 
so i never did get into them . 
, when i bought the computer , all of a sudden i was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail . 
i think they all thought , we have a live one . 
she 'll subscribe . 
but they were wrong . 
i never got into them . 
i guess we might as well end our conversation at this point . 
it was nice talking with you . 
it was nice to talk with you , too . 
thank you . 
the aids issue is a bit of a problem . 
i guess the first thing that comes to my mind is the financial end . 
and how can a country stand to spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem , 
but , then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the knowledge , or at least the rumor that we 're not spending as much per afflicted person on cancer . 
take breast cancer , for instance . 
it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting many more people than aids . 
and yet more people die of it , 
aids has more money than breast cancer . 
that 's interesting , is n't it , 
if it 's true . 
i 've always heard these things . 
i 've never bothered to dig it out and make sure , 
we think that 's the world 's worst thing 
so let 's give money to aids . 
and yet we 've had breast cancer problems for years . 
course , one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that , since it does n't effect men , it 's not going to get funded . 
what did you think about that idea ? 
i thought , that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing . 
but then i got to thinking , the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate 
and there 's only one test that just recently got developed a antibody test for the antigen in the blood 
and that 's fairly recent . 
and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years . 
they 've not really given it attention either , 
so it 's not really cured , 
it 's not that heavily funded either 
and then that seems to be one of the major problems that men have in the realm of cancer , 
so , i do n't know . 
i guess there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to . how they fund whatever illness they wish . 
it 's kind of hard to get an even keel on that . 
it 's really hard to say , 
there 's a hundred thousand per year affected by this one 
so let 's give it this amount , 
and then this other one 's only a tenth of that , 
so give it a tenth of that and just keep doling it out that way 
i 'm glad i 'm not the one that 's in charge of making those decisions . 
you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they 're all so serious . 
it 's not so serious until it affects your family 
and then all of a sudden it 's the most important thing . 
so i would hate to have that responsibility just personally 
but then , again , we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address . 
and many of those things if they 're not able to be insured then the country 's going to pay for it one way or the other . whether it 's through prevention or treatment or just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves . 
it seems like one way or the other we 're going to end up paying for it . 
that 's true . 
so it 's kind of a unfair advantage , as it were , 
but , the other thing that i thought of on this is , i wonder if there is n't enough money in our economy or in our system . 
it seems like there 's so much that goes to things that do n't really do a whole lot of good . 
they 're kind of nice . 
but , we have such an affluent , society that i wonder if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a cure for just about everything . 
of course , then we would n't have any room to put people , 
just change our priorities a little bit . 
you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza 
or you hear these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this , that or the other 
and then you have all the arts that are nice and aesthetic , 
but are they that enhancing for the masses . 
since i initiated the call , i guess i 'll start off first . 
number one , i have absolutely no problem with random testing . 
i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job 
and i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for , particularly airline pilots and such . 
i 'd feel much more comfortable than i do now , based on what i 've been hearing in the newspapers . 
so i really do n't have a problem with it . 
i do n't either . 
i do n't work , 
i stay home with my children . 
but my husband works 
and they do have that at his place of employment 
and neither of us have a problem with it . 
it 's a scary thing to know that you just do n't know what people are doing before they go to work . 
there have been so many , 
probably just for our own safety when we 're traveling and things that would be something i 'd like to know that 's going on . 
my job is i 'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world 's largest paint company , 
and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs 
and we , at the present time , do not have random testing . 
and i am pushing towards that . 
i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide , they should n't have a problem with it . 
and if they are trying to hide something , then i have to know that , because we 're talking major liabilities . 
not only with themselves , but with other employees . 
they 're talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that i would much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested on a random basis . 
i have a real fear , that at some point something 's going to happen . 
and they 're showing it with aids , 
they ought to start doing something with the drugs . 
so i really have no problem with it . 
it 's unfortunate that everyone does n't have that opinion . 
i 've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it 's an invasion of privacy and things like that , 
they feel that 's not fair and whatever , 
but those kind of things i 'd like to know myself . 
i 've had a lot of dental work done , 
and the last dentist did n't even use gloves at all , 
so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me . 
that scares me because if that 's the way they are , 
if i were a dentist , i 'd want to be protected , too . 
you would think so . 
and i worked for a dentist 
you come in contact with a lot of blood and things like that 
and it 's real , real dangerous . 
i would think , 
airlines just drive me crazy . 
people are afraid to fly now just because they do n't know what their pilot 's been doing and things like that 
i do n't know . 
and i think they 've had it for several years . 
and their program they had , i do n't think had a lot of problems associated with it , 
and it sounded very positive . 
and i think it 's great . 
i would encourage it . 
i 'm pushing our company towards that . 
because a lot of people obviously are trying to hide that from their employer and friends and family and things 
and too many people are just dying . particularly in our area . 
i do n't know what the crime is like where you are , 
but the crime rate here is just astronomical . 
ours is changing . 
ours is changing , 
it 's increasing . 
i live in a very nice suburb 
and it 's unbelievable what 's going on and the selling of drugs . 
it 's just too loose . 
it 's too free . 
i have two very little children , under two 
and i got a piece of paper from my husband 's office , 
it looks like a sticker 
is kind of fun . 
it 's best done when you have leisure time 
and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now . 
and i grew up in an area that was just a few feet from a rather large lake , 
and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake 
and we had a variety of boats at our disposal . 
i worked for a camp for a number of years . 
my father was on staff there , 
you name it , they had it 
and we did a lot of , water sports . 
we spent about a summer 
and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it . 
if you ever got it dumped over , though , it was a mess to get back up . 
this one you had to work with . 
and sailing was kind of nice 
to learn the maneuvers you had to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind , as it were , tacking back and forth 
and more than once we 'd get out there on a really stormy day 
and as soon as the front came over , it was calm . 
so you 're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle 
and that did n't always work . 
but it 's a nice hobby to have . 
nowadays i do n't think i could afford the boat or the time , 
nor do we live that close to a lake anymore , 
things change , i guess . 
what are your memories of boating , 
my husband 's family had a motor boat when we got engaged 
and they took us out on the lake several times . 
and i really did enjoy that . 
i do n't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything , 
but we did some water skiing , of course , and , driving around the lake in the boat 
and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting . , 
they just did n't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever . 
the laws were there 
that 's true . 
but i found the motor boating was real fun . 
i remember learning how to ski , 
i guess i was seven or eight years old 
and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to 
and i got all ready to go 
and i was down in the water and set to go 
and just as that boat took off , a turtle bit me in the middle of the back . 
it did n't hurt too much , 
but it bit enough to where i let go . 
and the boat went off without me 
and i reached back there and pushed him away and got out of the water a while 
and , it did n't even leave a mark . 
and so i told everybody what happened 
and they go , . 
and so i get back down in there 
and i 'll be if he did n't do it again . 
this time a little earlier 
so i moved over a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and managed to get up . 
did n't go very far , 
but i got up . 
and it was a nice long skiing career , 
i 've , done about all i dare do on skis . 
skiing on one and jumping around here and there 
and i know how you can get injured doing much more than that 
life just changes a little bit in that respect . 
they 'll allow you to ski backwards . 
i have n't managed to get a hold on that craft yet , 
that sounds like a real challenge . 
it would be kind of nice . 
i had n't quite figured out , 
i do n't have anybody to teach me either . 
that 's another little thing . 
you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do , 
but , just from what i 've seen , you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around . 
but i do n't know , 
where is your favorite place to go ? 
we have n't traveled outside the united states that much . 
that 's great . 
we have a nine year old . 
have you ever been there ? 
when both of my kids were much younger . 
and this time we 're going to be going with just one daughter 
and she 's nine , 
so it ought to just be a ball . 
i think so , too . 
that 's great . 
so we 've been there a number of times 
and we 're going next year . 
we have a business trip every fall . 
we go on a lot of business trips . 
i do n't work . 
so you travel a lot . 
we do . 
my husband travels a couple times a month 
and in the position he 's in , they do n't care if i go along . 
so it 's great . 
i just kind of join up when it 's something interesting 
and it will be at this time of the year 
that will be fun , too . 
have you ever been there ? 
we went years ago . 
we have n't been lately 
and i know they 've changed it a lot and upgraded everything , 
but we used to have a lot of fun there . 
we went there once . 
and we were on our way home 
and we were driving 
and then i said , i 'll going along , 
i hope it 's swimming season 
because it was n't a tremendous amount of things that i wanted to do there . 
if you do n't like the night life and the antique shopping , there is n't much there , 
but , that can be fun . 
we do like the night life , to an extent 
and i 'm kind of anxious for that , 
i know this is a real good time to go , because they are having so many activities and special shows . 
be excited about all of it . 
if you 're working , then you 're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go . 
not really , 
we 're doing the same thing . tying it in with my husband 's business trip 
and i just save vacation for things like that . 
and just travel whenever we can . 
when i heard my topic today , i thought , that 's my favorite 
how easy . 
and really at our point of life our children are grown 
and it has just worked out really well with this position he 's in . because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you 
and it depends where he 's going whether or not i decide to go along 
but i do like to travel 
i do n't mind the pool life at all during the day . 
and i like to sight see 
and i love to shop . 
that 's perfect . 
what more could you ask for ? 
that 's right , 
and then got to pick and choose the places . 
and so i 've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets 
because we have a lot of flying with continental 
and they 're recommending that you use those because they do n't know the future of continental . 
it 's kind of shaky . 
and i said now that we have all the miles , we better start using them . 
that 's true . 
it really is . 
and it was fun . 
it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country 
and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it . 
i think that 's a good trip . 
and then we rented a car for two weeks 
and it was just great . 
there 's too much to see really . 
i think i would like something like an economy car that gets really good mileage and one that 's really reliable . 
i think probably not a brand new car , 
and , of course , it has to have air-conditioning . 
and what else do i want . 
does it have to be a special color ? . 
i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice . 
it sounds like something your husband would drive ? . 
that 's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work . 
i do n't think we 're looking for another car right now because we just bought one , 
but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts , of course , 
and we wanted air-conditioning and a five speed 
and that was kind of iffy , 
but that made it better economically , 
i think that 's something we might want , too , is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic . 
we 'll probably have to look for another second car sometime 
and we 'd look for about what you 're looking for . 
but probably real cheap , too . 
it would n't be a , used car , 
but , . 
i think we would want one that , even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed . 
would you like four doors 
or does n't really matter . 
probably that would be a good idea , 
it 's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes . 
that 's right . 
so if we wanted it to take people out that 's a good thought . 
that had n't crossed my mind . 
it would be fun just to win one , would n't it ? 
i would go for that . 
that would be great . 
i think that 's all that we need to say . 
thank you for calling . 
we 'll talk to you later . 
and we have of course , started random drug testing here 
and i have n't gotten called yet , 
but i feel that it 's pretty good if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs . 
do they feel that way ? 
i think it 's a good idea just because i 'm opposed to the drugs . 
i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it . 
i do n't know , 
but , yet that can be carried to an extreme , too . 
so i think it 's a good idea 
i do n't know that their job would be at risk , 
because i think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs . 
i would think that , 
and you go through the program 
and then you 're called six months after you complete the program 
and if you test positive , then you 're terminated . 
, i guess i draw a hard line , 
but i 'm in favor of that type of thing . 
that you have people out there that are responsible for certain things 
and you expect them to do their job 
and it is possible that they ca n't do as good a job as they might do . 
that 's right . 
and , of course they can also cause injury to other people . 
if they 're not fully functional mentally while they 're doing their job . they could cause serious injury to another people . 
and you never know 
they could just go off the deep end on something whatever they 're taking at the time 
and it would be out of the question . 
that 's right . 
they talk a lot about drugs there 
and i think it 's good that they 're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools . 
but i think they can test all they want for drugs , 
and i know many of them are doing it . 
and i do n't know how many others are doing that 
that 's right . 
and , i do n't know , 
it 's just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle i think . 
i think personally i 'm for it . 
there 's several reason why i could think of right now why we should n't have it such as drug testing runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it . 
it 's that high ? 
and 
it 's very expensive . 
i did n't realize it was that expensive . 
it 's very expensive to run them . 
and i did n't get a raise this year , 
because , nobody in our company got a raise . 
but , yet they spend all the money on drug testing 
just lucky to have jobs . 
and if they were n't spending all the money on drug testing , people could have got a raise . 
i think that 's more of a personal view of mine other than a we should have drug testing because there 's really a problem 
and i know that . 
but then , i have other views to it . 
and he took another one 
and i do n't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together . 
because if it 's a thousand dollars , that 's a thousand dollars they wasted . 
theirs might not run a thousand dollars . 
i do n't know , 
that 's just guessing it . 
maybe they run a lot of other tests , 
or maybe it 's under a health type program that it would catch a lot of things . 
but 
i do . 
china painting and ceramics . 
how great . 
i enjoy it . 
ceramic painting . 
i enjoy the china more . 
the china more . 
and now that i have my eyes , corrected to the point that i can see the delicate part of china painting , i do enjoy it . 
how did you ever get into that ? 
that sounds so interesting . 
my husband kept begging me , 
and he 's been dead now for twenty years , 
so you understand that this was a long time ago . 
but he finally brought me the china , the book , the brushes 
and he said i have made arrangements for your lessons . 
and i said i 'll do it for three months 
and if i do n't like it , that 's it . 
i painted an awful lot until his death , which was several years . 
do you do it just for yourself , 
or do you do it to give as gifts , 
or do you actually sell it ? 
i have sold quite a bit . 
i give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home , 
and then i just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it . 
do you work outside of the home ? 
i have just retired . 
you 've just retired . 
what a great hobby . 
it 's a great hobby , 
but do n't retire . 
do n't retire . 
i have stayed home for about the last nine years . 
we 've transferred around , 
so the lake life appealed to me , 
and my husband 's working 
and he left it up to me if i worked or not . 
but i do make all my own clothes 
and we recently purchased a new home , 
but she does n't china paint 
so we both have our expertise side . 
that is excellent . 
so we were right on the lake . 
what 's that , 
but , i have never heard and i have actually never run into anyone into the china painting 
if you ever start , be sure and start with a large flat plate . 
where you 're getting into the delicate work . 
that 's right . 
where did you first get your lessons from ? 
she just taught china painting . 
how marvelous . 
then we had so much fun there , 
and she would help us 
and we bought lots of equipment from her , supplies 
and it was just such a delightful time . 
and it 's so nice , 
it must be so nice for you , now that you 're retired . 
so i have put it aside for a little while , 
but i have just found me an instructor to get started again , 
is n't that great . 
and you 'll probably really regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a class again . 
and i have two daughters 
and me too , because i eat out a lot . 
i travel , 
so you eat all your meals out . 
i eat a lot of meals out , 
i 'm also married 
and my wife is an a one cook , 
but she enjoys eating out , 
so i have to share it with her . 
and actually it 's very easy for me , because i make it a practice when i am out , 
i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here . 
so , i look for just about anything , 
and it 's a lot of fun . 
i was going to ask you , 
could you go to nice places , 
and it 's really great . 
i like different types of food . 
what are the memorable places you 've eaten ? 
you name it . 
let 's see , 
it 's a great place . 
it 's great . 
but it is fantastic . 
i get it . 
but i have gotten to quite a few . 
and i know the locations , 
and i know the places , 
but lot of times i do n't remember the names . 
i 'd have to go back through some expense reports . 
but particularly , down in your area , i 'm looking for some more restaurants . 
not particularly 
which one were you going to recommend ? 
there 's so many places here , 
i 'm writing it down . 
and it 's a great place . 
i 've been there . 
i 've been there . 
i know , 
i do n't like that place . 
i like the food , 
when i went , i thought the food was not good . 
magic time machine is the place you 're thinking of , 
that 's it , 
that 's it . 
i 've had excellent food there . 
the people drove me crazy first of all 
but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was . 
that 's great . 
do you like southwestern ? 
and it 's great , 
sometimes i 've been when i thought , it was n't as good , 
but i went there recently , 
and i thought , this really is good . 
this is great . 
this is going to give me some more places to go . 
a whole new , dining experience . 
i guess our time 's about up , 
they do n't always . 
i thought sometimes they say this is three minutes or whatever . 
they 've been doing that when the circuits are busy 
and other than that , they leave you go about five minutes , 
and then , that 's about it . 
it was a pleasure talking to you . 
thanks for calling for helping us out . 
you bet , 
how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home ? 
i do n't feel very good about it , 
but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do . 
we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore . 
he actually died a few months after that , 
at least in retrospect , it was the right thing to do 
because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days . 
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him ? 
it was actually not a particularly great nursing home . 
mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it , because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in . 
what do you think ? 
my grandmother lived with us until august , 
and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home . 
so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home , 
and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility . 
that 's important i would say . 
and the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days , and would have to be hospitalized a day or two , 
so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room 
so she did n't have to be transported back and forth . 
it 's not her favorite place to be in . 
she 'd much rather be here with me . 
and i 've got little children here who needed me here 
and that becomes difficult then . 
she was falling down and hemorrhaging 
and all kinds of physical problems , 
so it just became too much for me to handle , 
even though i would have liked to have had her stay , with her health being what it was she could n't anymore . 
we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life , 
but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could 
but he was living alone , had an upstairs apartment , could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain , 
eventually things just went too far 
and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home . 
i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age , other people have to kind of help them make decisions . 
but she 's accepted it real well now 
that 's right that the children have some responsibility , too , to their parents and such , to help decide what 's the right thing . 
we enjoyed having her here , 
but we feel she 's much safer where she is now . 
she still continues to fall , 
but when she does a nurse is right there to help her 
and i know she 's eating the right things , 
and her doctor 's right there where he can come in and check on her , 
so , i think she 'll adjust , 
have you done any painting projects lately ? 
this is a great topic for me , because i just did my first two painting projects ever . 
was not a big deal 
what kind of painting was it ? 
two little deals , 
and it was very easy . 
was it ? 
so you 'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something 
but i know i can do it . 
and the second one was i bought some toys at a craft fair . 
and so i decided to paint them , 
and that was n't as easy as painting the apartment . 
that 's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base , 
so i had it all over my hands . 
i had never painted anything , 
so i did n't realize that i needed that . 
i kind of knew , in the back of my mind , 
you ca n't use oil on wood ? 
you can use it on wood , 
but i just had it all over my hands , 
and i went to wash the brushes out , and wash my hands , 
and you ca n't wash it off with water . 
you have to get a solution 
you had to go around with paint all over you , temporarily , anyway . 
i had to drive to the store 
i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner , and everything like that , 
the same with the toys , 
it 's just important to look for one that does n't have lead in it , 
it says safe for children , and all that . 
i heard about that . 
she just started up a day care center , 
and one of the real strict restrictions , was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff 
so she had that done . 
have you painted anything recently . 
i had to paint the inside of this warehouse thing that you keep some farm equipment in 
was it huge ? 
and it was like paint thinner . 
but you just took a roller and put it on there , 
and if you saw that the wood was getting wet that was all you needed . 
it used all of it . 
i guess it was about three hundred yards worth . 
so . i guess it worked out . 
it was pretty easy , actually . 
i think though we 're lucky that we did n't have to do any detail work , because i do n't know if i could , 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know , 
must be difficult , 
what about the trim in your house ? 
did you have to do that ? 
it was really easy , 
we had a couple of different size brushes , 
real easy , 
i went around the trim , 
and there was wall paper , 
i was just doing just the trim around the doors and windows 
and there was wall paper 
and if we got it on the wall paper a little bit , we just wipe it right away before it dried , 
it came right off 
so there was no major mistakes , 
did you have one coat or two ? 
two , actually 
we did n't tape anything , 
we were n't that careful , 
i do n't know , 
it 's funny , 
it 's like , if you just go slow , at least i did n't get that many mistakes 
i did n't make that many mistakes , 
me , i would have had to have taped the whole thing , and then brushed around the edges , 
and then i 'd have probably rolled it on . 
it would have taken me forever . 
why ? 
just because you 'd be afraid to do it , 
or have you done it before . 
the first time it probably would have taken me forever , 
if it was my own i would have , 
but my friend said , just go ahead , 
you just go ahead , 
it 's easy . 
i said , it 's your place , 
how long did it take you all ? 
a couple of week ends 
we would go down two or three hours on the weekends , 
so there was two of you all ? 
they were doing all sorts of repairs , 
and i was just painting because i do n't know how to do anything else . 
that 's easy enough . 
so , there 's a whole bunch of people . 
so now i feel like if i ever buy a house , i can probably paint , if nothing else . 
i think i could probably do it , 
as long as the hardware store told me what to buy , then i could do it . 
but i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys , 
and the guy said , get this , 
it 's a nice shiny gloss , which was true , 
it 's worth the shine , 
what is your practice as far as budgeting ? 
do you manage the money ? 
we talk about it , 
i see . 
that 's how kind of i am , too . 
are you married ? 
you are . 
i think the women for the most part end up managing the money . 
my husband always says he earns it , and i have to spend only what he earns . 
i do n't mind the spending , 
that seems to be our challenge . 
i do n't work outside of the home , 
and he always threatens that when i spend more than , what 's coming in , i have to go back to work 
i see . 
so i manage it . 
i 'm at home also , 
so , it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary , 
do you actually follow a budget ? 
we pretty well do . 
several years we did n't , 
and we found that we just were n't making the most of what we had , 
and so we , set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for , 
just our bills . 
we try to save a little bit , although we 're not always successful , 
and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs . 
that 's pretty much the way we did in the past , 
at this point our children are grown , 
and so i really do n't have the obligations there any more that we have to balance to get things together for them , 
and i really just keep very good records , 
and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that , 
i do n't always succeed at that . 
i usually keep one with a low interest rate , 
and i put things on there that i think i 'm not going to get to 
and then i have another one , 
we 're in a new home , 
and they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to 
so i 'm still getting used to that , 
but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we 're going to pay for it ahead 
and we do not buy us , new cars . 
we had new cars always until about four years ago , 
my husband owned his own company 
and it went under , 
and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment , 
and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that we do have a used car , 
he has a company car also , 
but for our personal car we have a used car . 
do you think that it 's wiser to buy used ? 
we do for us 
very much so . 
in fact , we are in a position that most of our friends wonder why we just do n't go to a new car whatever , 
and i said look , you guys are all into car payments , 
we have n't had car payments for so many years , 
i love it this way , 
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked 
and we kept saying , would n't it be great if we could find another one just like it . 
believe it or not , we did , 
we found one , one newer 
the worst part is , it 's the same color 
you have two cars the same , 
and i said , you know how when you have a bad one , you say , never again 
that 's right . 
i said , we had one , 
and so i said , this was a cinch , 
we paid for the car , 
and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on . 
this is for all the long running back and forth on interstate driving and things , 
and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years , or next year probably . 
do you buy from dealers or from individuals ? 
generally from dealers , 
and it depends , because i do n't like to sell what we 're trading in to an individual , unless we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell 
we were going up to a larger one , 
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer , we always make a deal . 
we have walked out of more dealerships saying , do n't bring us the manager , and all of that unless you want to bring him right away . 
you 're going to get one shot at us 
this is the price we 're going to give you out the door . 
we do n't want to hear about taxes , 
i 'll let you start . 
do you all keep a budget , 
i never keep a budget . 
my budget or philosophy is spend as little as possible . 
that 's good . 
and it 's sort of always worked . 
especially for these times . 
that 's a lot of it . 
i know we tried several different ways . 
one time we tried something that really worked 
but we did n't keep it up . 
i passed it on to a friend 
and she wo n't quit doing it . 
she loves it 
and that was the envelope system . where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend , 
and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that . 
and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form causes you to realize how much is left . 
and then at the end of the pay period , if she has any left , that much is for fun or entertainment . 
and they kind of work it that way . 
we tried for a while 
and those are the ones that will kill you . 
i could n't probably be bothered doing that every month , 
that 's what i mean . 
we 've been married almost thirty years now 
but my husband got paid once a month . 
that 's kind of hard . 
you learn to get through to the end of the month 
but do you sort of self budget even , 
because if you charge things you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month , when you get paid , 
or you get paid the last day or next to the last day . 
you pay all your bills 
and there is n't anything left to spend anyway . 
that 's true . 
what we 're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely . 
and we 're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month . 
or we are paying them off now . 
we 're not there yet . 
there was a time when maybe we did n't take all of them off , 
but you just sort of had to watch what you put in , because you hate to pay those finance charges , when you see how much it is . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
i 'm a substitute teacher , 
so there 's only been really one working . 
same here . 
and it works for me 
but i ca n't see that it would work for probably the majority of people . 
that 's good . 
you know what i 'm saying ? 
i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we had n't had a car payment in five years , we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for , to see how much was going to be left , 
and that was a real eye opener . 
it is when you do it that way . 
but to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i 'll spend less on groceries but we 'll go out . 
so it 's kind of hard to say this is how much you 're going to spend going out for fun . 
this is how much you 're going to spend . 
it 's kind of hard . 
we eat out a good deal at this point . 
do you ? 
how nice . 
what minuscule amount i made 
but , that way you just did n't put it on your credit card , 
and it was paid for . 
and you enjoyed it better probably . 
. 
and so i think that that 's difficult for most people , 
but then my father was , very scotch 
i think so too . 
and you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to . 
so if you 're out in a department store and there 's a sale , you 're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you ? 
that 's excellent . 
that 's what i 'm working toward . 
i think you 're probably much ahead of me there 
and i 'm working on it . 
and i never worried about saving money because we 're in the savings plan at work 
and they took it out 
same here , 
same here . 
and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you do n't have to go through the company to get . 
you know ? 
we never had too much of that 
that came up . 
and we did n't buy really new or expensive cars . 
i think the most , we ever spent for a new car was six thousand dollars . 
and they were mainly used cars . 
that 's the best thing to do . 
my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it was n't worth it from the day after . 
we 've been rather frugal in that respect . 
rather frugal . 
that 's going to payoff on retirement . 
do you think we 've been here , 
do you have any recycling programs there ? 
i do n't really think we have anything in the works as of yet . 
we 're a pretty small town 
we 've progressed a little bit farther than that . 
it may have even spread all over the whole town , 
and it 's just as standard as a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump . 
and you put your bottles in it and paper and all those things 
aluminum . 
and a lot of the restaurants they just have places where you can throw away green bottles , and then the brown bottles . 
and i do n't know , 
i guess they 're clear bottles . 
so a lot of people do have those separated . 
and they have those strategically placed around the city . 
and they 're actually going to extend it one of these days maybe to apartment complexes 
that would be good . 
things of that nature . 
so , i guess when you live in a bigger city it really becomes necessary . 
it 's not anywhere near that . 
but that 's as far as we go 
because i take them to a girl at work , 
i can do that for her 
it 's a pretty small little town . 
i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans . 
so that 's about all that we 're doing here . 
they 're getting a little bit more , 
they 're doing a real good job of separating it here . 
and , of course , there you have a specific place to put your paper . 
and they try to get you to go ahead and separate it , 
but they actually have the door to door pickup . 
and i think it started out to be just kind of a test , a pilot project . 
and it went over so well that they just extended it . 
i do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not . 
it may be . 
but they just go around to each door and pick it up . 
that 's excellent . 
that 's good . 
let 's see . 
for a bigger city they 're pretty thick . 
they are . 
and sometimes you might have two or three . 
so that 's a big savings right there in itself . 
ours just goes in the regular trash . 
there 's not a whole lot . 
and there are some places that will set up for old newspapers and stuff . 
but usually it has n't caught on yet . 
i 'm hoping it will soon . 
recycled paper is actually very expensive . 
so , when you see something that 's on recycled paper , they 've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that . 
they 're not coming out ahead at all . 
it 's really a cost . 
. i was n't totally aware of that . 
it sounds good to the public 
aluminum i do n't know . 
they may be coming out ahead . 
but i know , for a fact that the paper on that end they 're not . 
but it 's not to their advantage . 
and it costs less . 
i ca n't think of anything else . 
i ca n't either . because we 're at a very beginning stages , 
we look forward to it . 
i hope you all come along a little farther in the future . 
me too . 
it was nice talking to you . 
you too . 
how would you go about organizing a family reunion ? 
my family got together almost every week . 
and there would be thirty people . 
so how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives . 
my father has five sisters and two brothers 
and my mother has four brothers and two sisters . 
both of my parents had big families , 
and we always got together , just always . 
now it 's different because i live here 
when i go home i try to see as much of the family as i can 
but it 's real different . 
and i grew up in a real not normal setting . 
with all of you living so close together . 
and like i said there would be thirty people , 
and everyone would just bring things 
and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook . 
i come from a very small family . 
so that 's all the family , 
so planning our family reunion was very easy . 
i guess so . 
it really sounds like it was fun . 
the question was on lawn and garden work . 
how do you like it ? 
i do n't do much of it here . 
and there are no bugs there . 
and i did n't mind getting in the dirt there , 
but i 'll tell you what , 
once i see these bugs around here , i 'm just kind of out of it . 
what kind do you have ? . 
do they really ? 
cockroaches are awful here . 
just awful . 
and i know somebody that lives there , 
and they never mentioned that problem . 
maybe they did n't mention it because it 's just kind of a fact of life around here . 
they probably just take it for granted then . 
it must be . 
it does n't matter . 
they make good fertilizer in the garden . 
i do n't have that problem , 
i said i 'll do inside work 
you do outside work . 
but i do n't like it dirty . 
i have to say that 's not exactly my favorite thing either really . 
i do n't know . 
we got the question 
and i thought , this is going to be interesting . 
two bits i 'll get a man to talk to me , because they get stuck doing it all . 
and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home 
so we 've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall . 
today we just had a lot of rain . 
so it 's kind of nice . 
it 's been real hot here lately . 
we 've had to actually have the air-conditioning on and everything 
it 's supposed to rain again this weekend . 
i see . 
we 're leaving tomorrow 
this is going to be a switch for us for a week going down there , 
but as far as the gardening and things like that goes i do n't know too much about how much i really do enjoy it myself . 
do you like it at all ? 
not here . 
here i just ca n't stand to even get out in the dirt . 
just , 
i liked it a little bit 
i was working at that time full-time and did n't have a lot of time , for that 
and so that really hampered it a little bit . 
and then , too where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly . my water bill was high . 
not really . 
very good . 
i guess we 've kind of covered our subject matter , since neither one is really into gardening , are we ? 
afraid not . 
hopefully they 'll give a subject i like one of these times . something i really know a lot about . 
nice talking to you . 
nice talking with you . 
are you there ? 
do you know the question for today ? 
and what is your feeling ? 
do you think this is vital important ? 
do you , 
i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing , 
a lot of them are so ill informed 
they have no idea even that there 's an election 
and these are people that are registered . 
i have worked in some campaigns 
and it 's the most discouraging thing in the world . 
and i have often wondered if maybe that would help the situation . 
i do n't know . 
that 's a thought . 
can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people ? 
i do n't know 
i like that idea . 
i had a thought just a second ago 
but it slipped my mind . 
that 's all right . 
probably one of the reasons that people do n't vote more is because they do n't know the candidates . 
that 's one thing that i have learned in working in elections and things is sometimes even when you work for someone you do n't really know what they 're like . 
and when they got in office it was just a disaster . 
and i 'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them . 
the only thing is if they do n't vote , they have no right to complain . 
i do n't know why we are so complacent , 
but i 'm going to vote each time . 
right or wrong i 'm going to cast a ballot 
and then if i 'm unhappy with it , i have the right to express my opinion . 
that 's right . 
and i 'm like you . 
i 've just lost a train of thought that i had . 
three . 
three . 
you have to skip three . 
and of course , they can be , a long time apart 
i think that 's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it . 
of course , 
no excuse . 
i 'm not sure if i 'm familiar with that , or not . 
and you do n't have to be sick , out of town or anything . 
there is no excuse . 
anyone can go and vote . 
i think that 's great . 
do you ? 
my husband has run for office before 
and sometimes it 's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because if you 're going to be tied up that day campaigning or whatever it might be . that just kind of takes that load off , 
you can just go ahead and get that taken care of 
but that is an excuse i could live with . 
i am so bitterly opposed to this . 
if you 're busy , that has always been a legitimate excuse . 
let 's see . 
they have five , six people at my polling place . 
they can come from all over the city , 
and i do n't know why we could n't have duplicate voting on some of this . 
hopefully once they 've checked them off the list they do have to check them off a list when they vote 
i know . 
i do n't , 
and i have n't had much experience with nursing homes . 
i have never visited any of them 
and i do n't think i 've ever even been in one . 
have you ? 
actually i 've been in them but just visiting 
and she 's lived with us for five years . 
so i kind of know how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home 
and it takes a lot of care 
there 's someone in my fiancee 's family . 
his grandmother too 
her son , his uncle , whatever . 
he 's recently retired 
and so he 's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke 
and all the other children are working or whatever . 
they 're all my parents age . 
they have a day care two days a week . 
they call it senior citizen day care . 
but she goes in the senior citizen center . 
so he gets a break two days a week 
but it 's only for two or three hours at a time . 
and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he 's not able to do now . 
to put her in a rest home ? 
and is that how your parents feel 
she says that when her husband died that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't think my parents would 
but she is getting pretty bad 
she has to have a little toilet right by her bed 
and my mom has to take care of her pretty much 
i do n't know . 
it 's a hard decision , 
but i do n't think i would do it to my parents personally . 
i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either . 
i 'm not really experienced 
but like i said i just have that one family , 
and i just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now , than he thought it would be . 
when he retired ? 
and he 's got seven brothers and sisters 
and , he 's the one because he 's the one that is n't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone . 
it 's that good for us just because my uncle and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months . 
that 's great . 
so that works out good . 
that 's a good idea . 
and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever , i do n't know what they 're going to do . 
it 's really not my family . 
it 's my fiancee 's 
so i ca n't say much . 
but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either 
and i wonder 
so if my parents do need to live with someone , it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for , 
that 's fine with me . 
my fiancee and i both figure that 's what we 're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever . 
you know what i mean ? 
we feel like , it 's our responsibility , 
and i feel like i would never put them in a home . 
but i wonder if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something . 
you think about it 
i do n't know . 
this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country . 
you think ? 
and , it 's really more of a respect issue that the older people in other countries that i 've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people 
and they really seem as wise 
and in this country nobody really pays attention 
and nobody respects the traditions . 
, i 'm not saying that i do either 
but it 's just funny 
and we really do n't have any that do n't have the social security and everything 
really is n't that much for elderly people to live on . 
even if they 're in good health it 's incredible . 
they do n't get special treatment 
and maybe they should because we 're all going to get old someday . 
i know . 
and so it 's kind of a depressing topic though . 
how old are you ? 
i 'm twenty . 
so and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother . 
it really is 
this is a subject that you never think you 'll be assigned to . one that kind of comes up when you 've lost the other subjects . 
as i was sitting there , i thought , the weather 's been perfect . 
i do n't know much to say about it . 
are you ? 
it could n't have been better . 
that 's right . 
it did n't foul one launch , 
and that 's kind of unusual , 
and it 's kind of cold in the mornings 
so you dress up warm , 
that 's the only thing wrong i can find with it . 
how fun . 
and the trees are changing color there . 
i miss that , 
as soon as we got out of the cloud cover . 
of course it was n't sunny like it is here . 
it was real gray 
but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees , it just really made me realize how much i miss the fall . 
i guess you have to take some things and leave some things . 
that 's right . 
and they have tons of canyons where the leaves change 
and they 're gorgeous 
you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area . 
we went up to the upper peninsula , 
and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure . 
and then on leaf weekends which is this time of the year , it 's bumper to bumper traffic , 
whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves , because they had to keep watching the road . 
it 's kind of hazardous for driving 
that 's for sure . 
but i ca n't complain . 
i do n't know if i 've been spoiled . 
i 've been thinking it 's getting cold sooner than normal . 
we 've only lived here a couple of years . 
i think it is , 
everything just happened three weeks early this year . 
we 'll have to see how it goes , 
a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal , 
but then we 're back to being warmer than normal this week , or last week , 
i do n't have to live through any of those really , 
nothing comparable to what you 've had before . 
i 've only been here just a short time , too , 
so i have n't been through any of those either , 
and life goes on . 
you 're right . 
so , as i understand it here , if there 's anything , they 'll call off schools and close businesses . 
they get ice , 
and no one can drive on ice . 
the real definition of ice . 
so i think we 've discussed it good enough today . 
i think so . 
it was good talking to you . 
it was nice talking with you . 
maybe we 'll get the next time . 
take care . 
why do n't you start 
you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon . 
i 'm already on my job 
you are , 
so , you reached me at my job . 
how do you dress for work ? 
my dress for work most of the time is rather comfortable and casual usually slacks and a soft colored shirt . 
but when i do n't need to dress up for a meeting or a service of some sort , i do n't . 
you 're in a church there ? 
, this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool , 
and they 've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds , 
and they have bible lessons 
and they have all the things during the morning , 
but they still have snack time and play time , 
but around here , at this time of the year we are into sweaters and coats . 
it 's a beautiful day here , 
and it 's in the sixties , 
but we still have a lot of hot afternoons , 
it 's kind of an in between change , that they 're in their summer clothes during the afternoons , because you just ca n't stand the sweaters , 
but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly . 
today we wear coats 
did you ? 
but i do n't think there 's an escape from light jackets . 
i understand . 
the wind will take away a lot of body heat . 
are the people around you dressing similar to you ? 
very similar . 
you do n't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do . 
i 'm not stuck with that kind of a situation . 
that 's good . 
that 's good . 
yesterday i had to dress up , and , be more formal because i had a formal meeting at noon time , 
but then i can go home later in the day and be a little more casual 
that 's wonderful . 
and then if i have a meeting of people that i know , i can be very casual in the evening . 
so he has to dress , 
and he just really hates it , 
and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long , he said it 's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress . 
around here in a lot of places that 's the way it is 
there are expected , dress codes 
and the people need to follow that . 
i think years ago , i used to be far more committed to the idea of a dress code 
but i 've relaxed a lot more as i 've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself . 
i think that 's great . 
i think that 's good . 
it 's taken a long time to break away , from that 
i understand . 
but now that i 've broken away from it , i 'm glad i have . 
and i will run around to the store in slacks and tennis shoes , 
you mean you do n't need to wear little old house dresses any more ? 
and pearls , 
and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school , 
so she tells me i dress young , 
but that 's okay . 
that 's a good idea , 
that 's a good idea . 
there 's not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing . 
i guess this is what you call a natural end . 
what kind of shoes do they wear down there ? 
of course , like i said , if my husband 's going downtown , he 's got the whole men 's dress shoes 
i 'm sure they are there . 
i 'm sure they are . 
that 's right , 
i 'm sure that true . 
it 's a lot different than working in a kids preschool . 
a lot different . 
that 's right . 
you all have a nice day there . 
you too , 
and thank you for calling . 
thank you very much . 
i almost forgot the topic , 
i was waiting so long for it to find somebody . 
major dad . 
you like that one ? 
i love it , 
i think it promotes good family values , 
and it 's funny . 
i 've never really watched that one . 
it 's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows 
and there 's only a few that i like to watch routinely . 
what kind do you like to watch ? 
i like shows like growing pains 
and what 's the other one , 
so i do n't get to watch it very much . 
wonder years ? 
wonder years , 
that 's my favorite . 
i like both of those real much also . 
i think basically , they promote family values . 
wonder years , 
i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever . 
i guess i can really relate to it , 
and it 's just a real cute show . 
i do , too . 
i do n't like it , 
and when you have children watching it , that sometimes really starts to bother me 
and that 's one of the reasons , 
my wife really likes that show , 
which i always felt was wonderful 
one of my favorite shows used to be happy days 
and when he left the show it seemed to be missing that part of it 
and i never did like it after that 
so , i do n't know , 
i see the same thing in wonder years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch . 
there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere . 
i agree . 
do you like the sports programming ? 
i enjoy those also , almost as much to a certain extent . 
our whole house is baseball fans 
and we enjoy that , 
so you 're going to watch a game tonight ? 
so do you have a favorite for the series or anything ? 
otherwise i really do n't care that much , 
and i 'd like to see him do well all the way to the bank i guess . 
he 's a nice guy . 
and 
they 've come from so far down , 
i really would like to see them do well . 
maybe they 'll make it , 
i do n't know 
but , 
i like sports programming quite a bit , 
and getting back to the point that you made , that 's really true , 
and her daughter was talking about birth control 
and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time , 
and she 's only seven years old , 
so many of them now it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in , 
and , i 'm an adult 
and i have adult tastes now , 
but i do n't need that 
i like things that are wholesome . 
that seems to be more our values , too , 
and you can kind of relate to it , 
i do n't know , 
i enjoy that a lot 
but i agree with you , 
people would watch them because there was really the period that was going on there , 
he really was n't messing around with the girls , 
but everybody perceived him that way , and stuff 
but as soon as he went to move in with another girl , the show just died 
and it 's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way , 
what kind of music do you like ? 
i was thinking about it for a long time , 
and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music . 
i do n't have a whole lot of dislikes . 
i like jazz especially the blues , 
i enjoy a lot of the modern forms , 
do you like rock and those kind of things punk even . 
some of the punk when i was in high school , that was one of the big things , was punk music , 
and some of it has a lot to say , 
the music does , 
the lyrics do , 
i do n't think they have a whole lot to say , even . 
it really expresses some of the opinions of the people who enjoy the music 
i guess . 
but as far as a musical art form , i just do n't see a whole lot of art to it . 
do you like rap ? 
some of it 
it depends . 
and one is the rap that is just funny , 
and they usually do a lot of satire 
that kind i kind of like . 
some of it is kind of pointless , 
i do n't enjoy that at all when they 're just talking about , i 'm better than you , and . 
i do n't like that . 
i like the funny , satire , 
and then some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in urban society . 
it really does . 
it talks about race relations and police relations 
i 'm , with you though , 
i like classical 
i do n't like to listen to it all the time , but some of the time , anyway . 
i like easy listening , just kind of , 
i guess i do n't care much for rock and roll any more . 
i used to like it all right , 
but i do n't really care to listen to it any more for some reason . 
let 's see . 
country western i 'm not quite as big on that . 
some of it 's okay 
that 's about my opinion of that . 
it 's okay , 
some of it kind of falls in the rap category i guess , 
. the thing about country western that i do n't enjoy is , does n't seem to be any imagination behind it 
a lot of them , sound really similar , 
and so the musicians do n't get to really get into their music . 
they just play a certain number of chords 
the drummer plays a certain beat , 
and you have a country and western song 
that 's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes , too , i guess . 
has kind of the same sound over and over , 
and the other thing i do n't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you ca n't understand what the lyrics are 
you ca n't understand what they 're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them , too . 
and i ca n't say that i like a lot of the very modern , rock and roll , 
earlier things . 
and i really enjoy , especially the sixties ... 
while i was waiting for you to connect , i thought of a couple of menus , 
so i decided it had to be in it , informal or not . 
i 'm not into formal dinner parties , 
i see . 
so what do you use for cookbooks ? 
but , it 's kind of the bible of cooking for me . 
then i have some from church that are more family recipes that are more useful budget cookbooks , 
and , of course , you get a lot from when you 're growing up . 
i cook a lot the same as my mom did , 
of course i 've added several different recipes , 
i think we come from different backgrounds , 
that 's good . 
so , it 
i find the joy of cooking to be a remarkably useful book to fall back on , 
because it has almost everything in it . 
but on the other hand , it 's not very inspiring , 
it 's a good reference when you need to dig something up . 
which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes 
the whole meal 
that would be wonderful in these times . 
i find that the cutting up of the food , and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes . 
either they 're really fast 
what 's one of your favorites ? 
sounds too good . 
that 's certain you can do in thirty minutes . 
i would recommend you look at that book if you 're a busy person . 
that thirty minute cookbook . 
thirty minute cookbook . 
that sounds fun . 
i find a lot of the cookbooks that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients , or things i do n't keep on hand all the time 
and i have young children , 
and our budget 's set at this time , 
but i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand , 
i do n't have to run to the store to buy or look for something i have n't heard of . 
that 's why sometimes i shy away from more of a traditional cookbook 
but it was interesting talking to you . 
it 's a fun subject . 
food is one of my favorite things too . 
anything else you wanted to add ? 
you had said dinner , 
what would i put together for a formal dinner . 
that 's good . 
and , my wife did this part 
so i do n't remember all the details 
there 's a little bit of brown sugar in there , 
and it 's a delicious thing , 
and it 's easy 
that sounds good . 
comparatively . 
so . . i 'm sorry , 
that sounds really good . 
it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am , 
i 'm pretty simple right now , 
maybe a little more leisure time to do it . 
i do n't know , 
that 's true , 
i have little ones 
and they wo n't eat too many different foods right now . 
i found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes . 
there again , sometimes it was easy , 
spaghetti 's a pretty staple every other week or so 
and it goes a long ways too . 
talk to you later maybe . 
i guess our topic is advice about going to college . 
do you have children of your own ? 
i do n't have any children , 
but i 'm still going to college . 
are you ? 
what school are you going to ? 
. are you enjoying it ? 
it 's a lot of work . 
and what field of study are you in ? 
it 's actually in computer science 
that 's neat . 
are you really ? 
the service . 
i see . 
that was one of the things i was thinking about in school , 
and i had a friend , 
and she had to pay out of state tuition 
and i think that would have played a real big part of my decision 
it would have played a major part in mine . 
of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now . 
it was four dollars a semester hour 
and so i was going to school for just a few hundred dollars a semester , 
so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state . 
that 's good . 
so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that i liked well enough to attend . 
the second thing is some colleges only offer the liberal arts whereas state , they offer engineering courses 
some schools may even give you financial aid , where another one wo n't . 
that 's true , 
that was something else i had , was , i had government aid , of course , 
but it was wonderful , because i got one of those grants that you do n't have to repay 
and 
it was so nice 
it paid most of my tuition , and a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing 
that 's great . 
i 'm sorry , 
what did you say ? 
what kind of grant was it ? 
and it was from the government , 
and at first it was based on my parents ' income . 
my parents had five children and really did n't make enough money to send any of us to school . 
and so because based on the number of children and the amount of money my father brought in , i got a small grant 
but then after that , i was on my own , working and trying to go to school on my own . 
so then i got a real big grant , because the amount of money i was making really did n't compare . 
so , it was kind of nice . 
i do n't know if those are still available or not , 
there 's a lot of different organizations who do give grants , 
but i 'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much , they generally run . 
this was great , 
it was just based on how much your tuition costs and everything , 
and generally it paid everything , 
so i went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing , 
that 's great . 
it was really nice . 
another thing . 
i 've got a degree from another college 
and something that might play a part is the size of the college . 
the smaller schools can give you a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools 
in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy , 
and they just give you a teacher 's assistants 
that 's right . 
and you do n't get near the quality of education , 
and as well , the smaller schools often times do n't cost as much . 
i did n't know that . 
but i guess some of the other smaller colleges might be a lot different . 
. at state , i think it 's just a waste of somebody 's money to go there 
it 's really a shame because of the instruction 
i 'd rather go to any other college in the state , 
and i would definitely get my money 's worth , 
much better than state . 
it 's kind of unfortunate , because they 've just grown so big that they just do n't care about the students any more . 
you 're just a number . 
they 're bent on seeing how much more land they can get , and how much of the campus they can build up 
it 's really a bad situation here . 
that 's a shame . 
what do you feel is the major change that 's been going on ? 
that 's a tough question . 
we are now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework . 
do n't ask me . 
i think that has been the major change , is that , women feel they need to go out and do this , 
they no longer feel it 's no big deal to stay home and raise your family any more . 
it has no credibility any more . 
i know it , 
and i think that 's really sad , because i think there 's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else . 
i 'm a school teacher , 
and i 'm in charge of raising them , 
so i can appreciate it . 
i 'm still home with my last one , 
and i would n't change a minute of it for anything . 
good for you , 
good for you . 
and one woman had four children , 
and her husband said she was n't pulling her own weight in the family 
that 's frightening 
it 's sad , 
and , from the audience participation it was almost a social issue 
people were siding with the husband , saying , you 've got to go to work , 
if you have these four children , you 've got to support them , 
and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them . 
i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life-style than necessary 
that 's true . 
i do n't think the kids do n't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars , and this type of thing . 
i think that they would from the attention or whatever 
that 's true . 
i do n't know , 
i see it as a major problem 
and i think it 's going to have to swing back the other way , because i think we 're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this . 
as i said , i teach school 
and i 'm trying to think , 
i do n't know , 
i have one mother that i know is home , 
but she also has ten children . 
what grade do you teach ? 
six , seven and eight . 
six , seven and eight . 
where do you live ? 
i have a daughter in middle school , 
but do you ever see problems that you feel that the kids are left alone too much , 
i 've got one child that stays with me every day until five , because his mother does n't come home until seven , 
and he does n't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself . 
he stays at school ? 
and the school allows that ? 
he stays with me 
and i have a tendency to work late . 
i work until six 
so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home 
and i have lots of kids , because they know i 'm there late 
but they 'll come in and say , can i stay with you because i do n't want to go home to an empty house . 
when i said i 'm raising them , i am , 
because we 're talking about boy friends 
and we 're talking about what the girl said in class , and what 's right because there 's no mother at home 
no mother to talk to . 
and it makes a difference , 
and just the social values , 
do you feel it will swing back the other way , 
or do you feel there 's just going to be a big push for more and more day care type situations ? 
i do n't know . 
and i listen to my daughter , 
and she 's going to work , 
and she 's going to buy her house , 
and she 's going to get her car , 
and then she 's going to have her children , 
and then when they go on one salary , will they be able to sustain what their life-style is . 
and they 're back to work , 
and i agree with you , 
i was raised in a generation we did n't need all those things 
and we lived without them , 
we did fine , 
why do n't you go ahead and say what you feel , 
and then i 'll respond . 
i 'm very guilty of not doing my part with recycling , i 'm afraid . 
and it was very easy to put everything out there , 
but we do n't have it at least in our neighborhood right now 
so , i 've been very guilty about not making the effort to take things where they belong . 
how long have you been here ? 
so we still feel very new , 
but it 's working up to a year now , 
i think that 's a good excuse . 
you need to get into the system a little more and know where to take things . 
we 've been here probably two and a half years , 
so i think we 're doing well . 
we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now . 
where do you take those things ? 
and then we usually save up our cans and change them in for money . 
where do you do that , 
because we 've been saving cans for my daughter 's choir , 
but i did n't know where to take them . 
i think there 's a service station there . 
and they are n't worth much right now , 
but it 's better than nothing , 
better than nothing , 
and what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the pickup now , 
it seems like ever since we 've moved here we 've been hearing that it 's coming in a couple of months , 
and , i think it 's been delayed . 
but the trucks that were supposed to do it , there 's been some problems with from what i 've read in the mail that we get 
and i ca n't wait for that , 
that will be easy . 
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off , 
they 're a lot of bulk , anyway 
they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can 
and i think that 's when i 'll start doing the plastic , too . 
it really was , 
it was just no effort at all no more trouble than taking out the garbage , 
i 've gotten used to washing the , salad dressing bottles and things like that , 
it 's not that big of a deal , 
and it 's nicer to just throw them out , 
but we can do our part take an extra minute or two . 
how much do you earn on the cans , 
when we first were here , it was like we 'd take maybe a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full , 
and it would be two dollars 
but since last time we 've gotten more like a dollar . 
so it 's gone down . 
which is understandable , 
i think , more people are recycling . 
and whatever pop we drink , we used to take the boys out for a bike ride , and pick up the litter the cans 
and that was kind of fun , 
but we have n't done that for a long time 
that sounds like a pretty good project . 
the boys think it 's fun , 
plus you get your exercise 
and , you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest , 
i 'll have to keep myself and get on it . 
my neighbor across the street is so careful about recycling , 
and so i keep telling myself , i 'll get it organized , 
but , maybe they 'll beat me and do the city wide first . 
and that will spur you on , 
i wo n't have any excuse then , 
that 's for sure . 
thinking about it , anyway . 
that 's all you can do 
do they time this thing for us , 
or do we , 
you can do it as long as you want . 
if it 's been long enough , 
five minutes is when they cut in and say , we do n't have any more room for recording . 
you ca n't chat all day . 
it was good talking to you , 
and maybe we 'll get on line again . 
so what is your house like ? 
it 's a two bedroom , two baths duplex . 
that 's neat , 
we own it , 
our side . 
that 's kind of neat that even though it 's a duplex , you can still buy . 
that 's good . 
do you have any children ? 
do you ? 
i have two children , 
and our home is really too small for us right now . 
ours is , too . 
we outgrew it when we moved in . 
we moved from an apartment that was really small , 
and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old 
it 's in one of the older areas of town 
and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere 
but the house is real small 
it has less than a thousand square feet 
it 's real little . 
and now i have a daughter , 
now the one that was five months old is seven years old 
and i have another one that 's three and a half and have all these clothes , and toys and stuff that we 're just trying to find places to put , 
they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room 
but the room that 's built on does n't have a closet 
so the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom 
it 's kind of a catch all room . 
but it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play 
how fun . 
that works out good . 
and so they can share a room and make for more space that way . 
and how old 's the youngest ? 
she 's three and a half 
and right now we have their clothes on double racks in the closet 
we made a higher and a lower 
and it works out fine , 
but they 're just about to get too tall , where the dresses are beginning to drag , 
and we 're going to have to figure out a new idea . 
but we 're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so 
so that would be nice . 
that 's what we 'd like to do . 
it 's a wonderful place to live , 
i do n't have any kids , 
so i do n't really know , 
but they say that we have wonderful schools . 
that 's neat . 
do you hope to have children , 
or are you not planning on having any , 
i do n't think so , 
i see . 
do you have any pets ? 
of course , those are my kids 
i have two dogs . 
do they stay inside , 
they 're inside dogs . 
that 's neat . 
they 're my babies . 
what are the colors in your house ? 
i bet that 's pretty . 
and then the kitchen 's kind of a country pink and country blue , 
and it 's all done in cows , 
that 's neat . 
i like cows , too . 
our house is very old also 
it was redone at the time when earth tones were in 
but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that 
so that 's worked out good . 
so that 's nice , 
but 
sounds pretty . 
we 've enjoyed living here . 
it 's close to my oldest daughter 's school 
and that makes it really handy , too 
and she really likes her school , 
and we are so close to shopping 
that 's an important factor there . 
i 've always imagined it kind of out , away from everything . 
and that 's just a mile or two from our house 
that 's nice . 
and now we have four 
but it does sound like it 's definitely growing . 
very much . 
i see . 
at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home , 
i 'm sandy . 
what a deal . 
took long enough to find you . 
seems like they take forever any more , 
did you hear what the topic was 
did she tell you , 
if you 're ready , then i 'll just go ahead and start . 
hold on . 
i guess we 're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women . 
seems like to me , everything is just changing so much that it 's almost like you ca n't keep up with things any more , 
and everyone 's striving so much to make it equal between men and women , 
personally , i 'm a stay home mom , 
and i like it the way it used to be . 
so am i . 
are you , 
i think it 's kind of coming back around to that , do n't you , 
i mean , that there 's a lot more people that stay home now than before , 
but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do 
i do n't know , 
and you ca n't have everything 
there 's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i want to be 
and to me that 's more important . 
how many kids do you have ? 
two . 
two ? 
are they young , 
five and two . 
five and two . 
i have two , 
and mine are two and nine months , 
and it 's just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning who 's a working mom , 
and these people have secretaries and these high power jobs , 
she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care , 
and i just do n't agree with that . 
i think it should be that people should get back to staying home and being more family oriented than not . 
it seems like everybody 's always so busy with everything that they 're doing that there 's no time for this and that and the other , 
and i hope it just does n't get to where there 's more and more women going into the work force . 
i agree , 
or , if they would n't be able to make ends meet not working or whatever , 
i think it 's got to be a personal choice , 
and , it 's nice that we could have the choice to stay home . 
just over the weekend i visited my family , and some cousins i had n't seen in a long time , 
and everyone 's all interested in what everybody 's doing , 
and i had my baby with me , 
and i found that all i talked about was my baby , which was fine with me , 
but it 's like here these people are , 
they 're going to school , getting degrees , making all this money , 
and they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages because i did n't have really all that much to talk about where career and things like that were concerned , 
which is too bad , because obviously i do n't get paid for my job , 
but i should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home 
that 's what i figure , 
i 'm worth a lot just for what i do every day , 
but i do n't know , 
this is kind of a , 
i 'm not from here , 
men do n't treat you like you do n't know anything , generally speaking . 
and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as job sharing or even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff , 
and i think that 's really important that they do that 
and they realize there 's a need for that , 
and i do n't know , 
i found when i did do some work when my son was young , it was contract work , 
and it was n't where i had to be there every day , 
but we were going to the doctor once a week , 
so , i do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor . 
i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem , 
do you have any pets ? 
i do . 
i really like them . 
i do , too . 
lucky and spot , that 's their names 
and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room , 
and my dog thinks he 's a mother turtle , and always has his nose all around my turtle box , 
so do you have any pets now ? 
i had never heard of them 
i have n't either . 
, they 're all white 
and they 're small and fluffy , 
they do n't shed . 
but they 're not very well known in this country , 
and how big do they get . 
ours is on the small end , 
and she 's about ten pounds , 
that 's interesting . 
and they love people and kids 
and that was something we were looking for , 
but we had a small yard and a pool 
and knowing how they love to dig and love the water we thought that was kind of a tough climate 
the water , 
so we ended up getting this , 
now he wants a good size dog . 
we 've got a good size dog , 
and i miss having a little one around . 
the kind you have sounds very interesting , though . 
they 're really sweet dogs . 
and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood 
and how do you spell that breed ? 
f r i s e . 
and they do n't shed 
so they 're good dogs for people with allergies , 
and they love people , 
not really . 
we used to swap back and forth dogs . 
they have three dogs . 
and now it 's funny . 
she 's a good watch dog 
but she also talks a lot , 
she has a definite personality 
does she ever mess in the house ? 
and they 're very smart dogs . 
but they 're very easy to train 
and about how much are they ? 
they range , 
i 'd noticed up here they 're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper . 
they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars which i thought was a lot . 
she 's no longer breeding them 
and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem , and did them strictly as pets 
they were n't show quality . 
just pets , 
we did that every weekend , 
but takes a lot of time . 
and it 's very expensive . 
but she might have some contacts here , 
that 's where i live , 
that 's where i live , too . 
how did you like that topic ? 
i do n't know , 
i 've got mixed feelings about the topic . 
do you ? 
i do n't . 
i agree with it . 
i think a company should be able to test any employee any time they see fit . 
i just do n't think there 's a place in our environment in the work force for drugs , or alcohol either . 
i do n't believe in drugs or alcohol , 
you did ? 
i can sort of understand that , 
that 's true . 
because i look at airline pilots bus drivers people that really have other peoples ' lives in their hands truck drivers 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
it 's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs and alcohol , 
that 's right 
and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read , 
in those areas i really do believe that maybe we should clean up our house . 
i think so too , 
i agree with it . 
they started it couple of years ago , 
and so many of the people , even the professional people they were so against them doing that , 
and i thought , to me it 's quite simple , 
you either need a job 
or you do n't . 
the job is what provides all of your needs , 
and if they say , you ca n't do this work , i 'd say , i agree , 
i wo n't do that . 
and i think most of them have agreed to that now , although they did n't like it at first . 
i think it 's just like anything else , a new concept , 
it is , 
i 'd probably feel the same way if i had to do that . 
but at the same token , in education we ca n't do random drug testing on kids 
that 's true , 
their rights are protected . 
you bet . 
what 
but if you 're going to do teachers or professionals , why not do the kids , when we see them and they 're under the influence . 
i agree with that . 
i would n't be opposed to it at all , 
it 's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it tooth and nail 
that 's true . 
i do n't know how long we 're supposed to carry on a conversation , do you ? 
it 's three minutes , 
we 'd better keep talking because i 've not heard it have we . 
have you heard it ? 
anyway , we both sort of agree on it , do n't we about random testing . 
do we agree , or unless it 's not me . 
listen , 
here we go again 
and there was an incident in my children 's high school , where a teacher stayed drunk , 
is that right ? 
you just do n't think of that happening with teachers 
i really do n't , 
when i think of drug testing , i 'm thinking of the outside of education . 
we are as susceptible a society as anybody else 
i know that , 
but you do n't think of that first hand , normally . 
it was on the news tonight . 
i agree with you , 
i know teachers are just like everybody else , 
same problems the same good qualities as anybody else . 
then , i think if push came to shove , i 'd probably be drug tested , 
and yet , i know of one teacher who was an alcoholic in school as well as out , 
and that was in your children 's high school , 
is n't that amazing , 
and my children brought it to my attention . 
i never was there to see it . 
if it was true there , i 'm sure it 's true with just about every school there is 
and that 's not giving a good example to students . 
they do n't need that example 
i 'm ready . 
so we 're going to talk about what kind of clothes we wear while we work . 
i work at home . 
you do , 
you 're like me then . 
i stay home also . 
do you have children ? 
i have two , a seven year old and three and a half year old . 
that 's good . 
how about you ? 
i have four girls 
they 're nine and five and three and a newborn . 
you are busy 
and they 're all girls , 
i have two girls , 
so , all girls around here . 
girls are nice , are n't they ? 
really sweet . 
as far as clothing goes my wardrobe changes all the time , depending on my size . 
that 's how i am too . 
we go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes , clothes that are in between where you 're not down to regular size yet or you 're on your way up from regular size 
that 's funny . 
and they 're all in boxes or bags , 
and they all rotate all the time 
kind of the same stuff all the time , though , 
i do n't get a whole lot new right now , 
i know that 's kind of how i am . 
i said , who ever i talk to is going to be board , because when it 's summer time , i 'm wearing shorts , 
and when it 's cold , i 'm wearing sweat pants , unless i 'm going to something special that my daughter 's doing , or something like that , 
i like jeans a lot . 
that 's good . 
i used to wear jeans all the time until after i had kids , 
and it 's frustrating , 
i find i have to get the right kinds , though , or it 's not comfortable 
i know what you mean . 
i was pregnant through the summer this time 
that 's right . 
course i 'm always hot when i 'm pregnant , too , 
i did n't really need warm clothes 
but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new units outfits that are just knit , 
i have n't tried those , 
they are so comfortable . 
it 's just a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff , 
or you can just wear them with tennis shoes if you want . 
so they 're really nice 
and i 've enjoyed wearing those 
but i sure never wear them . 
i do n't either , 
if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference . 
i worked part time when my oldest was a baby 
and i had to wear a dress every day , 
and it was a little bit hard to wind down , 
i would have to drive six thirty five home 
and i would be burning up in the summer time 
by the time i got home i was i 've got to get out of these clothes . 
i worked way before i was married , even , 
but offices , they keep them so cold in the summer that you ca n't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable 
you 've got to have something to add to it or something 
you burn up , 
it 's hard on the car . 
so i would roll my windows down , 
it was still a hundred degrees 
and i had a friend who used to take shorts to work , 
and after work she 'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes 
that 's funny , 
at least something cooler , 
because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them especially if it 's something that has to be dry cleaned , which i do n't have any of . 
that 's true , 
i do n't have to worry a whole lot about that . 
that 's right , 
that 's right , 
or if you get it dirty or whatever , 
i know it . 
i 've always been a creature of comfort , too 
me , too . 
if it 's not comfortable , forget it . 
i know , 
that 's how i am , too , 
wool was never comfortable to me . 
me neither , 
do you see anything wrong with public school systems ? 
i do . 
i think i 'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to deal with in some quality way . 
i think maybe we 've given our teachers a almost impossible job . 
i agree . 
do you ? 
do you have children in the public school system ? 
is that right . 
and the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much 
i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students , 
and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children 
you were a bookkeeper . 
everything had to be documented , 
and i had file cabinets that were n't filled with neat stuff for kids , 
it was filled with documentation 
i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back , 
i love to work with children and to teach them , 
me , too . 
but i 'm really having questions if i can deal with that system and have a good conscience about what i do . 
i do n't think it 's the teachers , 
i think it 's the system 
i think so too . 
they 're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now and teacher competency , 
and it 's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best , 
she 's always worried who 's looking over her shoulder 
what child 's going to say something some parent 's going to overreact to 
that 's right . 
i know . 
that 's true . 
that 's right . 
do you have children in the system ? 
i have two , 
one is in ninth grade 
and one is in seventh grade , 
we live in a district that has open classrooms , 
and i was n't particularly comfortable with that for her . 
i am too . 
you too . 
and it did n't work then 
and when we moved down here , i was just appalled that they were still doing it here , 
still at it . 
they seemed to admit that it was n't working , 
but they did n't have the money to restructure , 
or just to face the children different directions or to do something 
just , 
i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school 
so he spent all day in this one large open area , 
so , i did n't really care for that . 
were they ? 
but our children got a very good education there 
they were in the magnet school program , 
from the time they were about third grade , they changed classes several times during the day , which has its pros and cons , 
but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes 
and it was wonderful 
it 's ranked so much better . 
that 's right . 
we heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system . 
is n't that interesting , 
i do n't understand how they get this reputation unless it 's just that they spend a lot of money , 
i do n't know . 
probably so , 
i guess so . 
as a freshman ? 
and he 's pleased with his classes . 
i do n't guess i 've been in the high school long enough to know what to expect really how to judge it . 
my daughter seems to be having a good time , 
and i ran over and picked up her report card , 
and she did very good , 
and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work i would expect for a freshman to have . 
that 's good . 
she 's not bogged down , 
but yet she has some every night . 
so , that 's interesting , 
but , his grades , i have n't seen them yet , 
but supposedly they 're good , 
you always hear how good . 
my son 's at , junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful 
but , who knows what he 's going to bring home . 
that 's right . 
i missed a part of it . 
we 're to talk about what , lawns and gardens ? 
lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do . 
i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard . 
it 's very strange that i got this call because my wife just called me . 
this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall bulbs . 
we 've had a late fall 
in fact today it 's really warm , 
and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up , 
but you need to pretty soon . 
that 's the way this was . 
so i do n't know what happened last week 
but i do n't know if it 's late . 
so i can get a lot of stuff down out here . 
i enjoy it . 
now you have the chance to really create and spread out . 
this is my third house i 've owned , 
but it 's interesting , 
the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling , 
and it sort of gets away from me if you 're not with it . 
but , i enjoy most of it , 
and about this time of year it starts getting a little old , 
the grass not growing so fast . 
it is for me 
because i 've been doing a lot of fertilizing . 
we had a terrible summer , 
we had a drought 
and took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing , 
and now it 's really growing 
and i 'm trying to establish a good root growth for the winter . 
ours seems to have slowed down here . 
we 're not having to mow every week religiously 
but we 're still fighting bugs , and ready to change some of the summer flowers out 
it 's really strange , 
but that 'll change real quick . 
and then he calls us , 
and there just are n't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes . 
some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they do n't make it through the two swings . 
i was conditioned to it 
they have to be hardened to it 
that 's strange with me . 
for the most part we do n't , 
but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold . 
do they . 
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time 
you really take a chance with them freezing , 
i go there on business , 
and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens , 
very enjoyable gardens , 
except for the lack of trees , out where we are . 
it was all cotton fields , 
and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful , we really miss it . 
we lived there for five years , 
and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt , 
we were coming in 
and before the plane landed she looked out the window 
and she said , there 's no trees down there . 
and , when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house , there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land 
and now all of a sudden it was being developed , 
and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees , 
do you have any ? 
she 's about seven or eight years old . 
i like to hunt , 
did it work ? . 
i just love them . 
but she is n't alive any more . 
she was the greatest , went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle . 
do you have a pet now ? 
i have a cat now . 
he just turned seven , also , 
and he is huge . 
what kind of cat is it ? 
just , 
i got him , 
he was born in the wild in a shed and had never been in a building when i got him . 
but he 's a very tame spoiled house cat now that i 've had him for seven years . 
being born outside , you did n't have any problems house training him ? 
that 's good . 
he 's great , 
and he 's really spoiled , though . 
but he 's really big , 
so , lots of times he seems to get in fights , 
and when he was younger i think he started them , 
and now , i think he barely makes it . 
and older . 
we have a cat now , 
but we thought , if we ever get another cat we 'd want something kind of unique , 
so , we kind of looked around , 
i 've seen them . 
they 're huge . 
i have seen them . 
actually , i ca n't remember , 
i did n't know that . 
i think i 'm being accurate in the area of folklore , 
but i 'm not sure . 
that 's interesting . 
my family did n't necessarily like them as much as i did , 
i kind of like that , too , 
i 'd love to go to a cat show . 
i 'm a real cat lover . 
he does n't really like mine , let alone another one . 
i 'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog , 
and then i suppose our five minutes will be up . 
i work for a university , 
and i had some time off in the afternoon , 
so i went to a pet shop , 
and so i decided , this would really be a nice dog to have , 
i know what you mean . 
and so , i had to go back the next week , as well as a bunch of other people from the university , 
and one of the people that we went with they were friends of ours , 
and i decided i 'd take my friend over and show him the dog , 
and so i got over there , 
and she said , that 's too bad , 
the dog has already been sold . 
and i did n't realize it , 
but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier , bought the dog , 
and she was in the back room , 
and so that night we had a reception for some of the potential high school students or college students , 
and , he had the dog the whole time in his room , 
and i had no idea . 
and the dog rode in the car 
and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat 
and they left the dog in the car , 
where do you enjoy dining out ? 
do you have children ? 
we have four , 
but most of them are gone now 
but we were taking four , five and six people out . 
that makes a difference , does n't it . 
what area of the country do you live in ? 
i am , too . 
i did , too . 
that 's right . 
and then you 're stuck 
and it 's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave 
i like to go and eat there . 
but i would say service atmosphere , and whether the food is good , 
and on going out , i like steaks . 
so , we try to hit those places when we can . 
and we can have a salad bar 
that 's right , 
that 's what you find , 
i know . 
so he 's a fan of dairy queen , 
and we 'll go even in town here at times , just as a change although i 'm not that excited about it . 
but we eat out so much it 's gotten so i do n't like to really eat any place 
but yet i hate to cook food at home 
so that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because we 're eating out probably five nights a week maybe . 
or we eat junk food at home 
what are some of your favorite inexpensive places ? 
we 'll go to them all . 
we sort of take turns . 
if i have a coupon we can go there 
and if not we ca n't , because it 's cheaper 
that 's where we always go , 
but it 's just a lot cheaper than domino 's , 
and no particular reason , 
and she never wanted us to show up there 
so , we do n't go there that much . 
where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out , or a big meal ? 
a nice meal 
where do you go for steaks ? 
it 's usually when we 're out of town 
and i 'll order steak or steak and lobster combined 
so it 's really not in town . 
that 's where we go to get steaks 
they do n't take reservations , 
and you wind up waiting about an hour 
but the food is good , 
then you can go right through . 
so , that 's our nice place to go . 
we do n't usually take the kids when we go there , 
i guess we do go out without kids . 
we 're usually picking things up quickly , 
and with my husband traveling he can get all he needs of that during the week going to those places 
that 's right . 
so , it does n't really matter to him . 
he 'd probably just like to stay home . 
that 's the way with my husband . 
he 's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends , 
and i 've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere , 
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend . 
i think , i never have liked to cook food , 
it was mainly baseball teams 
and my husband would coach , 
so we were never home at the same time . 
if they 're not there in between five and six then i guess we do n't eat today , 
or you fend for yourself . 
you go somewhere else . 
i went , 
i did hear the end of the prompt this time . 
was that you , that we did n't hear the whole prompt ? 
those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment . 
i 'm not sure , 
and the parents are saying , wait a minute , 
we did n't do anything like that , 
and i guess before i 'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be an absolute certainty like caught at it , or something 
i do n't buy the routine , they 're just sick , 
or they were abused when they were little 
forget that . 
and they play loony for a while , 
and then they 're back out in public . 
but i ca n't see that either . 
i do n't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any reason to not use capital punishment . 
i agree , 
i agree , 
i think if i wanted to badly enough , i could convince somebody i was crazy , 
so , my family may say that on occasion , 
who knows 
i do n't think it 's that hard to do to convince somebody that you just had no control over what you were doing , 
and too they can always be blaming the other person , 
she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child , or something , which i think is , unfortunate for that person and yet should n't be an excuse . 
that 's the new one . 
i just happened to see the headline on it , 
and i could n't realize if it was the husband or the father or what , 
but i thought if children are being abused , i 'm wondering how our school system is failing , that they 're not even seeing this , 
if it was that severe that when they 're later in life adults , that it 's all of a sudden affecting them in this way , that it was n't shown up at all when they were younger , 
and that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having to deal with that yet , 
you 're right , 
and yet did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this ? 
never 
and there was , nothing on it , which makes me wonder if it 's as prevalent as some of them claim . 
you just do n't know , 
unless they 're caught in the act or the child is very badly beaten up , it comes down to a one word against the other that type thing . 
it used to be just capital murder , 
and now they added mass murder . 
i really would have no idea . 
i do n't really know . 
because i have a feeling it is , 
and i think there ought to be more things added to it . 
killing a child , or kidnapping 
and possibly not 
i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt , 
if they release them two hours later , he probably does n't deserve the death penalty , 
i 'll just go with you first . 
what kind of eating out do you enjoy ? 
i like dining out . 
of course , it means that i do n't have to cook . 
but i 'm a divorced woman . 
i have one child 
i think it 's sort of a waste of money to go to a real high priced restaurant . 
not really . 
me too . 
we do too . 
we do the same . 
what are your favorite places ? 
that is really good 
and i like it . 
we 've gone to august moon 
and we think that was real good 
and those are excellent . 
they 're really a nice place you could take someone to eat . 
but it 's a very elegant nice place to eat . 
very often we go out for fajitas . 
my husband has just gotten stuck . 
and some of those 
and get fajitas , 
and he 'll just eat chips until we 've got three or four baskets coming back . 
it was fun . 
you know , what ? 
and he said , `` i keep hearing good things about that place , 
we 're going to have to go . '' 
it is delicious . 
in fact , you 're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that . 
so i guess we 'll have to do it . 
you always stand in line when you go 
but it 's worth the wait . 
d magazine said that . 
it said there was always a line . 
but that 's a good sign . 
we did . 
and they like just the traditional . 
they 're the spaghetti warehouse type . 
they are . 
but my little girl likes spaghetti warehouse real well . 
most kids do . 
it 's real entertaining for her . 
do you ever go for steak ? just a steak and potato and salad bar , that kind of thing . 
not really . 
and what is that guy 's name ? 
i ca n't remember his name . 
steak . 
there 's a second one downtown , 
but their steak is supposed to be wonderful . 
so , i had not tried that . 
my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie . 
we found those one time 
and then they discontinued . 
and then they closed up . 
so most of these places are pretty much just theme restaurants around here . 
that 's exactly true . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there 
that 's right . 
and i have n't been . 
we usually do n't go for beef really anymore . 
where , 
when i go out , it 's normally to get some specialty type of food 
i know . 
i understand . 
and really they 're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant . 
that 's right , 
and save you some money too . 
that 's right . 
saves you a little bit money . 
what 's your child 's favorite place to eat ? 
favorite place , 
she has a lot , 
they 're easy . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
mine enjoy that too . 
they like to go pretty much where we like to go 
so we 've done . 
is there anything else you 'd like to discuss about it ? 
not that i know of . 
i think it 's come to an eye conclusion 
so i 'll talk with you later . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
do you have children ? 
we have two sons . 
one 's a freshman in college 
and one 's a sophomore in high school . 
and you ? 
the story of my life . 
my kids are involved in sports . 
my daughter has played basketball for six years , 
and my son plays football . 
my rule is that they ca n't play a sport the same time of the year , because there 's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere . 
it really helped when the older one was old enough to get his license and could drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems . 
i know , 
i know . 
the insurance . 
for one thing . 
but 
we do 
but there was not much overlap as such . 
the older one was not at all into sports for the most part . 
and the younger one is the sports one 
and whatever season it is he 's playing , although football is really his favorite . 
so 
just family time . 
at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth . 
but we did n't do it as much or as often as i would have liked to . 
what about you ? 
i 've heard of that . 
have you ? 
i 've never actually played it . 
it 's really fun . 
and a lot of them played it , 
and she started a group going in the neighborhood 
and my kids wanted to learn how to play it 
and it 's more fun with four people . 
and it 's a game that none of their friends know how to play , 
and they both enjoy it . 
so if they want to play , they have to play with mom and dad . 
so we play that a lot , 
and we like to go miniature golfing and to movies . 
we have family that lives outside of the state 
so we go visit both sets of grandparents and take car trips . 
so do we . 
so we go shopping . 
so that just kind of works out real well . 
and i 'm a writer by profession 
and my daughter enjoys writing too , 
so a lot of times , she and i will travel to writers conferences together . 
that 's neat . 
so . 
we 've never had anything like that . 
so that gives us special time together too . 
and she 's on the yearbook staff and things like that 
so i can help her with that 
and she gives me ideas for my writing too 
obviously things are different for me and my children than when i was growing up . 
and the whole family was around the whole time . 
and then what my father did was , obvious to me 
and i helped out with it . 
but although i have brought my boys to see where i work , it 's not that easy , 
and it 's certainly not at all common , 
and they just do n't really have that same idea , 
it 's a whole different kind of thing there then , 
my husband has taken us to work with him , 
and we still do n't know what he does . 
so , we just say he travels a lot . 
so , that kind of covers it . 
that makes it hard though in terms of family time with him . 
i 've been lucky in that respect that i do n't travel too much . 
he 's been on temporary duties where he 's been gone nine months . 
so those are the real killers . 
he 's gone three weeks right now 
and that 's mild compare to the big ones , 
and something major , always needs to be done . 
so you just have to handle it until he gets home . 
and hopefully he wo n't have too many surprises when he gets home . 
discussion on child care . 
do you have any children ? 
they 're all grown up . 
i work in a day-care center 
you know all about it then . 
i enjoy it a lot . 
it 's been quite a few years . 
i have grandchildren but have n't really been into selecting child care for them , 
and it 's been quite a few years since i 've had to think about that . 
do they go to a day-care center 
my daughter that has three stays home with her children , 
that 's nice . 
and one of my daughters has one 
but an aunt keeps the baby . 
that 's nice . 
but i would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays , 
but i would imagine it 's very hard . 
i think so . 
i think it 's hard to find a good day care . 
i have worked at some other ones that were not very good in my opinion . 
but this one that i 'm in now is very good . 
and one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children . 
but we keep it down to two to one . 
that 's good . 
that makes it a little easier to deal with . 
i 've always thought it would be really tough . 
what if you had a fire or something with babies ? 
i know . 
you 'd have to be able to get them all out . 
and they 'll sit four babies . 
we would just lie them in there 
and they roll real well and maneuver . 
that will get them out . 
i had n't thought about that . 
but i was thinking , if they had very many babies , they could n't possibly get them all out . 
that 's neat . 
that 's certainly something we hope never happens . 
do most of your day-care workers really care about the children , 
or is it just a job for them ? 
most really care , in this center , really care . 
most everyone has a college degree in early childhood education . 
and really there 's only like eight children per room 
and that enables them to spend more time with the children . 
so , it 's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them . 
it 's easy to get attached to them too . 
how old are the children go with this center where you work ? 
in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months . 
and throughout the center it goes up to age twelve . 
i have the real , real young ones in my room . 
those are , probably the best group to have . 
they 're wonderful . 
they do n't complain too much . 
and they 're fun . 
they are a lot of fun . 
babies are fun , 
and they 're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet , 
not quite . 
when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things 
you have to be real careful everything is baby proof . 
all the doors have latches and stuff so they ca n't get into anything 
but they try . 
do you think there 's very many really good day-care centers around your area ? 
but 
in my area 
there is a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what 's going on . 
and in general though i 've been really disappointed with a lot of other centers i 've worked at , and all 
it 's not my choice for when i have children 
but some people do n't have a choice . 
sometimes it 's a have to . 
you know ? 
most of them do n't really feel that it 's a great place to leave their kids . 
that is sad . 
and it 's really bad . 
one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place , 
and then they called her one afternoon and said , we thought we 'd better call and tell you before you got over here . 
and we just now found her . 
what ? 
they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon . 
and so immediately she says , i ca n't have any confidence in them anymore , 
if they 'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they 're one short . 
but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus . 
and this was four hours later . 
that poor child . 
what do you do ? 
that 's awful . 
so she has switched to a different center now 
i usually come back more tired after my vacation , then i do before i take it . 
i need to definitely take a vacation where all i do is rest . 
and i guess to do that i 'd probably have to take it at home . 
i enjoy the beach . 
and the waves were huge . 
i 've never quite seen waves like this one 
and i was standing in water not more than , barely above my ankles 
all of a sudden you 're in sand above your ankles . 
and i was standing there talking to my daughter 
and this really big wave came and totally threw me , 
and one foot did not come out of the sand , 
so i 'm never going to another beach again , ever . 
you might be like i am . 
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas , 
but i really do n't like to get in the ocean . 
i prefer a swimming pool . 
i love to go and play around . 
at least i always did although actually , i like the mountains . 
i do n't really like hot weather 
and i basically , do n't want to go to a hot place on vacation . 
i can understand that . 
that would be nice . 
and i really enjoyed that . 
i 'd like that . 
and we 've been talking about going there next summer . 
i do n't know 
it 's been a long time . 
but it seems when your family is different places , a lot of trips involved going to visit . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
you got that . 
and my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here . 
one of our kids lives out on the east coast 
and so we have to go to those . 
you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then . 
i know 
but i 'm tired of them . 
that 's right . 
my idea of the ideal vacation would be to begin with money be no object so just absolutely first class fly where i want to , rent a car if i want to and not worry if somebody says , let 's take this little side trip and not have to sit there and figure out again we fit that in there or not . 
and that 's what i would like to do . 
i have no interest , for example , in taking a cruise . 
i would much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself . 
that does absolutely nothing for me . 
but i do n't know 
i can say that i think my favorite spots are still to go where there 's mountains and a lot of trees and wildlife to view 
and , i like that kind of stuff . 
i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery . 
i agree . 
i can do that too , 
because i think that they have it all over there in , two miles . 
there 's mountains 
and there 's beaches 
and it 's all right there . 
i guess i 've never really thought about it that way . 
real excited when i heard this . 
so far i 've been trying to call all day because i keep getting these subjects like capital punishment 
so football , i love this . 
this is great . 
and we just moved here two years ago 
and they lost again . 
but they seem to be doing pretty good this year . 
and i grew up a bear fan . 
and then we moved here 
even when we knew we were being transferred here we became cowboy fans . 
and we kind of got spoiled . 
we expected it to continue forever . 
i think they 're doing pretty well this year though . 
have they just lost one game this year ? 
i think two . 
two . 
but they 're not doing bad . 
people are pretty surprised that they beat the giants . 
and was n't that fun . 
and i must say i attracted a lot of attention . 
i bet . 
people running up saying , what 's the score , what 's the score ? 
i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it . 
that 's right 
and that 's exactly what they said , 
my wife dragged me away from the television . 
i had forgotten 
or i probably would n't have been there . 
i 'm a big football fan . 
my father was a football fan my whole life 
and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff 
so when i met my husband , he was watching football 
and i figured out that i could n't see him all weekend . 
that 's exactly where both of the wives came from i think . 
it 's easier to join them than fight them . 
and if you want to see them , you might just as well enjoy football . 
i do . 
i love it . 
i just think it 's such a fun sport . 
we 're not convinced that we 're going to be cowboy fans yet . 
i guess we 'll first have to get used to the idea that we 're staying here . 
that 's even harder . 
are you transit usually ? 
do you stay not in one place too long ? 
this is only the second place we 've lived . 
we 've only been married for five and a half years . 
and we have two small children , 
it will take you a little while 
i tell you this , 
the weather here 
and there 's no mountains or anything , 
and it 's an adventure . 
and here you 've just got to drive down to the stadium 
i know . 
if they close it in we 'll have the best of both worlds then as they 're talking about doing . 
he 's from here . 
that 's right 
so . 
he was one of our boys . 
that 's what i hear . 
which is rare . 
which is good . 
it 's funny 
i was just thinking about one the other day . 
and i was trying to get my son to sing that . 
my husband was just having a fit 
do n't have him sing that song . 
but , they do a lot of fun things . 
i think football is kind of a sport that i think , it 's hard not to like it . 
there is so much about it to like . 
it 's exciting . 
it 's so exciting . 
and we all ran out and bought the records , 
and now we feel like they 're kind of a collector 's item . 
because i think about that a lot . 
but when i first moved here they did this . 
that was kind of a funny song 
it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here . 
we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs , 
do you have an opinion on credit cards ? 
i do . 
you do ? 
what do you think about them ? 
i think they get a lot of people in trouble . 
i have one right now 
and i just got it about six months ago 
and i find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally would n't get . 
you charge this for twenty , charge that for twenty , charge this for twenty , 
and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars 
and you do n't stop to think about it . 
so i eventually got it all paid . 
now i carry one . 
i have a gas card and a visa card . 
and i never use them unless i need to . 
that 's good . 
that 's a good idea . 
stops all them interest rates , 
but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them 
and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot . 
and they ca n't do anything but work to try to pay them off . 
and one of my friends hers is up to nine hundred dollars 
and she only earns two hundred dollars a month because she 's going to school . 
something like that . 
so all she 's paying is interest on hers every month . 
it just seems crazy to me 
my wife got in trouble one time with hers . 
and that was before we got married , 
we sat down and talked about it and discussed it 
and it 's come out pretty good . 
that 's the first thing he wanted . 
was a visa card ? 
so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick . 
i bet . 
i do n't know . 
i 'm about sick of mine right now . 
but i think they 're too readily accessible 
and there 's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you trapped . 
you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it , 
we just waited until time come around that we could afford it . 
and we had all the necessities , 
and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities . 
i always use it for something i want not something i need . 
my parents are really good about not using credit cards . 
they are against it . 
i do n't think they like the fact that i have one either . 
i think if cards were as stringent as a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills , we probably would n't have the problems we have . 
of course , we would n't have the retail market we have either 
so i guess they trade one for the other . 
i disagree with it , 
but they still trade one for the other . 
that 's good . 
you sound pretty young , 
i 'm twenty right now . 
are you ? 
so , just going to school and working 
last weekend was homecoming 
and i needed a pair of shoes 
so i just went out and bought them on my credit card . 
i did n't really have the money to do it 
it 's pretty easy . 
it sure is . 
so do you just have two kids 
are you ? 
but , this is a extra long one . 
what 's that ? 
they 're giving us a lot of time . 
have you done a lot of this ? 
do you do it every day ? 
i try to every day . 
i get calls at work , 
i get calls at home , 
i have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing 
and then that 's get rid of the half of the government payroll . 
i think that would probably be very possible , 
and we really would n't feel it in our services . 
i have . 
you 've seen that which was on there and the offices 
and in light of these hearings we 've all been sitting through the last two weeks , we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed . 
they really do n't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses in their own business of what they 're doing . 
and the other thing is besides that i think two things that very definitely need looking at , one is foreign aid . 
i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us . 
i find that a total waste and part of the defense budget . 
again being just a voter and a taxpayer working through our congressman , i do n't think there 's too much that i 'm going to be able to do about it , 
but i believe in taking an active part in politics , 
and the regular normal taxpayers are paying such a large proportion of our personal income 
i think that that would help a lot . 
i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things , 
but i do n't know . 
it 's just hard to take and see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use . 
and seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from that direction . 
the biggest part is they have no accountability for what they 're doing . 
if they do n't have that money now , bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government . 
not going to help . 
it 's never helped my personal situation . 
i ca n't say it would help with theirs either . 
or we 'd all be in dire trouble . 
i do n't know what we 're going to be able to do about it 
but i guess it 's sitting around so long that it 's sort of like our mortgages . 
i do n't ever expect to pay mine off before i die 
so why should the government . 
that 's the way they 're thinking these days anyway . 
it seems to be . 
it really does bother me when i think about leaving our children with this sort of a national problem that we ca n't seem to find an answer to it , 
i do n't know . 
i do n't think it ever will really . 
maybe if they ever get to the point 
i believe in paying my share , 
and i do n't mind paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to . 
but i just sometimes feel like i 'm being used . 
but again i do n't think we 'll be able to do anything about it , 
that 's quite possible . 
i guess we have to keep plugging away a little bit 
or it will just totally get even more out of control 
but i do n't know . 
bite the bullet . 
it sounds like you have a baby there . 
i do . 
that 's a shame . 
i do n't think i could part with her . 
we 've probably been on long enough . 
they did n't cut us off , 
but i think that will probably do it 
so it was nice talking to you . 
we 're talking about capital punishment . 
i am very much for capital punishment . 
wonderful . 
i am too , one hundred percent . 
my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus . 
and i 've been raised around prisons all my life . 
all your life . 
and i believe if you do n't have a punishment befitting the crime , there 's not any deterrent . 
there 's no deterrent . 
that 's right . 
there 's just no deterrent . 
that 's right . 
and so many of those kind of people , they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway 
so unless they really make it rough on them going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i do n't think . 
especially not a federal prison . 
i do n't know 
it 's not the judge 's fault i do n't think . 
it 's just the way the law is down here . 
our prisons are so crowded that they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two . 
it was over crowded 
and the federal came in and said , you have either got to build more prisons or let people go . 
that 's what ours did , 
same thing . 
and finally our governor at the time who is not in office now came in and said , where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose . under early bail or early get out . 
the death penalty is not given often . 
it 's not here either really . 
maybe it should be given sparingly , 
but i do believe it should be befitting the crime . 
i do too 
but the way the courts are set up they 've got so many chances for appeal , 
but i think it needs to be expedited . 
of course they 're entitled to a speedy trial . 
that 's right . 
but then they 're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals . 
so somehow it does n't really balance out too much . 
that 's right . 
somehow it just does n't , 
it works 
and then again it takes too long for it to work . 
the prisoner himself can come to the point that , i 'm tired . 
i just want out . 
i 'm tired of fighting it . 
then the system just keeps on . 
and at that point i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process . 
i do too . 
part of that is the overcrowding of the court system . 
that 's true . 
it is overcrowded because there 's so much problem with the people on drugs 
with the drugs they 're robbing and killing 
and that 's why it 's filled the prisons up so much i think . 
it does n't help them any at all 
it does n't . 
i do n't believe criminal is in a court by itself . 
and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that should n't be in there . 
that 's true . 
with all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things 
have n't we though . 
we really have . 
but i 'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment . 
always have been , 
always will be . 
i just feel like their crime and punishment 
and if you do n't have the punishment , you double your crime . 
and that is just personal feeling . 
it 's not going on facts . 
i think the facts would probably back it up 
it could be supportive . 
it 's supported with facts though . 
what ? 
it could very easily be supported with facts . 
and that 's an idea that 's been kicked around for a long time . 
i do n't know that it 's ever been seriously considered as far as close to passing any legislation or anything like that . 
i think so . 
everybody has to do something . 
or maybe theirs is , in fact , one year of military service for everyone . 
i believe that 's right . 
and i do n't know that that 's really what we 're talking about . 
i think of that . 
military service is not that much 
but , the , military used to do it 
and then country would benefit from one year from everybody and even out the , requirement . 
that 's a thought . 
it could even be done while they 're doing another job , while they 're doing a job to make money . 
i think the family would have to be involved in it . 
i think the basic message is that giving is better than receiving . 
and that 's not the kind of society we have right now . 
i 'm afraid you 're right there . 
there 's lots and lots of volunteer programs 
but at least it 's my opinion that most of those involve adults . adults who have the time to give and , the desire to give . 
younger people feel like it 's not open to them , 
i do n't know . 
but it should be if it 's not . 
i suspect that that 's not the thing . that they do n't feel it 's open to them 
and they promote service on the part of the kids to , some of those people . 
so at least that 's a step in the right direction i guess . 
i think you 're right that that 's not the way that the society these days is going , 
and there 's no question that doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than the people involved . 
it 's really a gift to yourself 
and i think that 's a really important lesson to learn . 
and maybe that 's why we have so many people in society who are not really happy . 
that could be . 
because if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself , you 're just kind of down the tube . 
it really is better to give then to receive . 
i agree with that , 
and i do n't know what has set it off or what 
so , what do you think about it ? 
i guess that 's so . 
i think there 's some problems , 
but they 're not really big ones . 
it 's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that . 
that 's interesting . 
i was wondering what your response would be . 
so i 'm , from immigrant parents . or an immigrant mother anyway . 
where did you come from ? 
so where did your parents come from ? 
and that was prior to world war two . 
but it 's interesting that with the topic i think i agree with you . 
there needs to be more of an open policy . 
but what do you think , 
that will be interesting . 
what do you think about that ? 
i think that 's all right . 
at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing . 
do you have an opinion about it ? 
the only thing is i 've got to share with you , my background is from new jersey . 
and he was always on pretty good terms with them . 
my sister just had a baby 
and it 's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem . 
it 's just very difficult to get a woman who does n't have a lot of assets or whatever out of china even temporarily to visit here . 
then you have the experience on immigration . 
that is interesting . 
did we really protect them ? 
and aside for that , they 're the best and brightest of china 
so it 's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can . 
that is true . 
that is true . 
what do you think about , 
what do you think about that ? 
and these are not the brightest . 
we 're talking boat people . 
i do n't have any problem with that . 
good for you . 
i guess so . 
i was ready for a fight on this one . 
interesting , 
so what was the last car repair you had ? 
and it was getting rusty . 
and the thing that they forgot to do was to also look at the hose , 
and the hose burst . 
so i was stranded out on the highway . 
did you crack the block or what ? 
i did n't do that 
but there seemed to be enough antifreeze left to do that 
but it cost me all kind of money to have that repaired after they said they had repaired it . 
so that was a horrible experience just recently . 
i see . 
you got lucky you did n't ruin the whole engine though . 
that can be pretty serious . 
i know . 
i know . 
what about you ? 
i guess it 's been awhile for me . 
it 's been about a year . 
i had the water pump break on my car . 
i was traveling , 
and it broke in the middle of nowhere . 
big pain . 
i know . 
i know . 
especially when you 're out on the highway . 
that 's where i was . 
and that was horrible . 
your car is fuming and everything . 
it 's already a hundred degrees 
you do n't need that too . 
but my car is getting old . 
it 's about six years old now , 
so is mine . 
so i got it right out of college 
and so it 's starting to show the wear and tear now . 
i 'm hoping mine gets me through . 
i got until may until i 'm out . 
so when i cross that one i 'll be okay . 
that was my graduation present to myself , 
that 's nice . 
i know 
but it 's really starting to wear 
so i 've been thinking , especially now is a good time to buy a car . 
because i do n't know if i want to pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it 's starting to breakdown . 
i do n't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is 
and it 's not worth it . 
that 's true . 
i agree with you there . 
so i do n't know , 
because i need to have it tuned up and replace some of the belts . 
the tires need to be replaced 
and so i was thinking just a lot of money 
might as well buy me a new car for that . 
i got new tires last winter too 
so i 'm that 's the last major purchase for this thing . 
it 's not worth it . 
we get some killer winters up here in the mountains . 
lot of snow and a lot of cold . 
especially do n't you have a lot of salt on the ground ? 
at times there 's a lot of it . 
you got to clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance . 
i have n't had a big problem with that though . 
so i 've been pretty lucky there . 
that 's usually pretty good . 
and go like that 
i usually like to do most repairs on my own though . 
do you ? 
just because that way i know what 's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really does n't . 
plus if something goes wrong , i know who to blame . 
i think i 'm getting too old for all that . 
i had four brothers 
and they used to drag me out underneath the car , and stuff 
so i can do all that stuff 
so i can get my hands dirty . 
so . 
i 'm just getting to that age i guess . 
your time becomes very precious 
so working on the car is just not one of those things i want to spend my time on anymore . 
more fun things to do . 
so 
i just need one , 
i had two cars there for a while 
so i would n't have to worry about which car was going to run . 
that 's nice . 
and 
and 
one is bad enough . 
one was bad enough . 
but i think i got rid of the wrong one . 
i need a lot of repairs done on this one 
so 
that was something else . 
are our five minutes up ? . 
i was just wondering that . 
i did n't either . 
this must be a hard category . 
i guess . 
but i guess they were talking about experiences . 
so i do know something about the really cold weather . 
and i 've always lived down here in the south , 
and i took my car up there to their house 
and i guess i had a crack in the block , 
let 's see . 
so what gets you ? 
and inevitably as soon as they 're asleep , someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something . 
and i think that , that is probably the most aggravating . 
i 'm the one that pays for the phone . 
if i want to buy something , i 'll take the initiative and go find it . 
and that just really does aggravate me . 
what do you think ? 
that 's exactly the kind of thing i would have said . 
although in my case it 's my wife and i both work , 
we come home 
and just as we 're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings 
and it 's one solicitation call after another 
your time is valuable , 
it 's like you say , very annoying 
and why do we let this happen . 
that 's interesting . 
the market seems to just be growing , too . 
i guess enough people are not speaking out . 
i 'm not speaking out , 
that 's for sure . 
i just get aggravated about it . 
if you could legislate something , what would you legislate ? 
i really do n't know . 
i 'm not into heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas , 
but , i do n't know . 
i do particularly find it annoying . 
i 'm really not sure . 
it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we do n't want to receive calls like that . 
and the people making these calls would be obliged to compare their lists that they 're going to call against this list of people who do n't want to be called . 
identify themselves , 
that would be an interesting way , 
and , that way , those who want it can have it 
and those who do n't want it , do n't have to have it . 
sort of like an unlisted number where you have n't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself . 
except even unlisted numbers are n't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers . automatically 
is that right ? 
that 's interesting . 
and they just get everybody . 
i do wish that it would stop on my end because it seems to happen at the worst possible moments . 
and i guess the next one is door-to-door solicitors . 
i do n't mind the children when they 're selling things for school . 
i have kids 
and that 's just kind of part of it 
and , it 's annoying as well . 
you really do n't know , 
but , i do feel like it 's an invasion of my space . 
what about these telephone callers who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire . 
i 've never quite understood the purpose of that . 
i think these people were hired from different sources . 
and so , therefore , there 's no one answer . 
but , 
basically it 's a market survey 
just a survey . 
there have been a couple of times when whatever the subject was caught my interest and i went along with it 
and then there have been several times when i just said , i just really do n't have the time to deal with it at that moment . 
but i do n't get too many of those . 
i 've had just a few . 
generally someone 's trying to sell me something 
and sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too . 
other times it 's wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose . 
for which , if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider . 
that 's right . 
but a dollar is n't it , , 
and i also sort of worry that sometimes people giveaway personal information . 
somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things , 
and so i start answering 
and then you go down a path 
and you do n't know where it 's going to end . 
and this is most likely not going to be used against you , 
that 's true . 
but it could 
and that seems to be something that should really be outlawed . because it 's subject to abuse 
you just never know , i guess . 
i ca n't really see that , 
i think if nothing else , they ought to spend money for a postage stamp 
now we 're ready . 
do you have a personal computer ? 
we have one . 
you do , in your home ? 
i do not have one in my home . 
i use one all day at work , 
but i do n't have one at home . 
do you find you use it a lot ? 
i do n't use it as much as my children and my husband do . 
and we 're just touching on data base , spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of , different kinds of storage 
and we 're just kind of touching on a basic computer . 
what kind do you have ? 
it 's a gateway brand that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs . 
that sounds interesting . 
what kind of a computer do you use at work ? 
and i use it all day at work 
and i put all my personal stuff on it at work . 
so i really have n't had a need for one at home 
but probably if i did n't have access to one all the time at work , i 'd want one at home . 
what is that 
tracking the flights and things ? 
how long are we supposed to talk on this ? 
they tell us when we 're through . 
this is my very first time . 
they come in and tell us . 
have you just started doing this ? 
but , i 'm going to ignore that . 
that 's a call on my other line , 
so i 'm just going to ignore it . 
i have that , too . 
where do you work ? 
you do ? 
of course . 
i sure do . 
of course . 
that 's , why you 're making these calls ? 
i 'm doing this at home . 
i 'm already home for the day . 
i see . 
this is a pretty good deal . 
i ca n't do it at work . 
i work in the legal department 
so i 'm pretty busy . 
that 's great . 
that 's something we want to learn . 
i think that 's about my favorite . 
i 've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it . 
that 's great . 
it really is , 
and i know there 's still a hundred things i do n't know how to do on it . 
but you learn something every time you use it . 
i have a question . 
on this survey or whatever i volunteered for . 
do i start calling in myself 
or do i wait for people to call me ? 
did they give you a number to call ? 
and eight hundred number . 
you can start calling in whenever it 's convenient for you 
but you can only make one call a day . 
only one a day . 
if you 've talked to someone , like you 're talking to me now and i place the call , this counts as your call . 
so you can not make a call now until tomorrow . 
i see . 
so then , do you get the five bucks 
or do i ? 
we both do . 
we both do . 
did n't they ask you for your i d number when you answered ? 
i had to put that in . 
so you both do . 
that 's a pretty good deal . 
from what i understand . 
why are we doing this ? 
it 's for research . 
actually , i 'm doing this for a friend of mine . 
it 's a research type project on voice activated electronics . 
it 's almost like a voice command computer type thing . 
they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up . 
they 're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this . 
i do n't know everything about it 
that 's wonderful . 
but they try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this 
and that way they can check voice patterns . 
i see , 
different kinds of voices and things . 
and get the computer where it recognizes voices . 
that 's why it 's interesting because i 'm going to say you have an accent . 
and i think that i do n't . 
to you 
so i probably do . 
and you 're in what city ? 
how about that . 
you probably did . 
they just recently moved there . 
that 's interesting . 
and then my sister works at the air force base . 
so i imagine they use personal computers . 
actually 
they both have personal computers . 
do they do their correspondence on it ? 
mostly my one sister uses hers for her children children 's games . 
so , we started recording already ? 
i guess , 
i do n't know . 
it 's the first time i 've made a phone call on it . 
so you pressed one ? 
so , i guess we 're supposed to start talking . 
what kind of books do you read ? 
my aunt got me hooked on those . 
so it 's mostly all novels ? 
they 're all novels . 
i 'll read some classic , too . 
like what ? 
i like that . 
and this is more of a play or something that it was from , that i saw 
and i read the book from that . 
and , by the way , my name 's bill . 
let 's see . 
what kind of books do you like to read ? 
a bunch of stuff fair number of novels , but mostly shorter ones . 
i really have to be in the mood . 
i read one maybe once a year . 
i 've never read anything by him . 
he 's dead now , 
but he was really a pretty amazing writer . 
he wrote books that were pretty short and pretty easy to read written at a third grade level or whatever . 
but they were still very heavy and philosophical , also very funny . 
let 's see , 
i found that real interesting . 
i 'm reading the lion and the wind right now . 
what 's that ? 
this is when they were having their revolution or whatever 
and really portrays him as a , kind of a crazy man . 
surprised me . 
i had no idea that he was like that . 
how crazy ? 
i saw the movie 
and that 's what made me want to read the book . 
i 'm a real big fan of hers 
i also read a lot of books about music because i 'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things . 
i like to read some of the philosophy stuff . 
let 's see , 
and even like reading some new age things , things that i do n't quite believe in , 
it 's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that . 
i 'm fascinated by that . 
i 'm fascinated by that . 
and , even stuff about , not ghost stories , but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses . 
and i like to read stuff like that . 
some of it really freaks me out . 
i got past all the gibberish on it . 
did you like it ? 
it was okay . 
it took me a while to really get into it . 
it did n't help me that much . 
i see . 
but i think once you 're set in your ways , you 're set in your ways . 
one real interesting book i read recently was , when i was looking for a job , 
i read , how to get the job that you wanted 
and , it had real good tips 
you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team , or who you think will be doing well this year . 
and , course , we have duke university that was the national champions last year , 
so i 'm kind of hoping that they 'll repeat again this year . 
they have a lot of the same players back . 
this is college basketball . 
this is college , 
so , hopefully we 'll have a good year . 
and that 's probably all i saw . 
we have n't really followed them too much 
and none of them are our alma mater 
so , that seems to help . 
do you like professional basketball ? 
i follow it especially around the playoffs , 
and , maybe now that that 's over they 'll come out of it 
that 's an up and coming team , though . 
i hope they do something . 
they need to 
or they 're not going to have any of the team left at all . 
that 's somebody you can get behind and , be patient . 
kind of like the cowboys , i guess . 
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons . 
they , coming out of it this year . 
we 'll see if it 's held on . 
the bulls ? 
they 'll probably be pretty good . 
that 's true . 
that 's true , 
it will be interesting . 
it will certainly be different . 
i do n't know , how close i 'll follow them , though . 
and the season has n't started yet . 
i 'm usually more the end of the season person , 
and we need to talk about baseball 
the basketball season 's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks . 
it 's a long season . 
it is , 
i guess my mind went blank . 
it 's like last season was so long ago 
and i have n't really even started thinking about basketball yet 
but , this was n't a good subject , 
but , we 'll see how our predictions come true . 
it 's a little early . 
we definitely will . 
it 's good talking to you . 
good to talk to you . 
i guess we 're recorded . 
what , 
that 's an interesting assortment . 
my husband is into cycling . 
in fact , he 's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the time . 
i 'm not quite that bad . 
nothing like that . 
i do some things . 
and i 've gotten to where i have started selling them at craft shows and things . 
that 's pretty good . 
and i have done fairly well at them . 
a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed , 
but most , of them have worked out pretty good . 
my only craft work is kind of like computers and go off to the little computer club meetings , 
and , it 's kind of nice because i 've made money at it , too . 
considering i work for it a living , 
but i 've got a couple of articles published . 
it 's kind of neat . 
what does a computer club do . 
i did n't know there were such things . 
just all over the place . 
half the members are really expert 
and the other half are really not . 
and we kind of help out the people who are really not . 
i think i 'm a hacker , 
that 's one of those sports i do n't go for . 
that 's kind of interesting hobby . 
you said you did cycling ? 
what was the other thing ? 
i belong to a boy scout troop . 
it beats paying united way . 
we have done that . 
so we 've done a fair amount of that in our spare time , also . 
that 's a great thing to do really . 
let 's see 
what 's that state north of us , 
that state 
that one . 
that one . 
that one . 
trying to think of the name of it . 
no memory . 
i missed out this last year . 
i was n't able to get the time off , 
but maybe next year . 
it 's a good possibility . 
i 've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do . 
that was loads of fun . 
does your whole family like to do it , 
not quite because i 'm not a whole family . 
i 'm just me . 
i rent my kids . 
sometimes , 
it 's better than owning on them and making payments on them , and things like that . 
sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea . 
they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go . 
probably , 
probably . 
which is in now . 
i 've done that 
when i like something , i usually try to figure out how to make money off of it . 
supposed to talk about boats . 
have you got a boat ? 
i do n't , 
do you ? 
i do n't . 
i 've had one for quite a few years , 
but i 've not had one the last couple of years . 
but , it 's something i 've always enjoyed . 
do you like boating ? 
i love them . 
but my children all have been grown for a few years 
and we were using it less and less and less , 
so we decided to sell it . 
what 's that ? 
the day you sell your boat . 
i loved having a boat . 
i loved having it . 
i just heard that . 
that 's just a joke , i guess . 
but , i 'd like to have one . 
i just do n't know if i 'd have the time to use it . 
he needs his weekends free , to be able to use it or a day during the week or something , 
but , 
i do n't know , 
i felt like i got my money 's worth out of mine . 
i had bought it used and kept it , ten years and got within three hundred dollars when i sold it , of what i 'd paid for it and had it all those years . 
so you take care of them , they hold their value real well . 
so you could n't complain about that . 
did you go fishing ? 
it was a big boat , big ski boat type thing . 
i did fish out of it occasionally , 
but i did enjoy owning a boat , 
i like to fish . 
would recommend it to anybody . 
and now sailing , i 've never been sailing . 
have you been sailing ? 
i 've sailed some . 
nothing big . 
i 've never tried . 
i 've always thought , i bet that would be more fun . 
i 've always thought i 'd like to . 
i 've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it . 
and , at this stage of the game , i 'm not that interested in it anymore . 
they 're getting kind of old 
so we get out on the water occasionally . 
that 's nice . 
but anyway , it 's fun . 
i do enjoy the lake , 
and we 'd go down there 
and we 'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much . 
it 's such a pretty lake down there . 
we 'd enjoy it so much 
and , i 'd say , i 'm going to leave the boat out , because we 'll probably do this again tomorrow . 
it got to where tomorrow the boat was still sitting there 
and we never did go out again 
and i 'd have to go load it up the next day . 
where is that ? 
that 's south of here ? 
it 's just a hundred miles from here . 
what do you take , 
you go down , thirty . 
thirty . 
it 's east of here . 
east of here . 
hundred miles due east of here . 
we just moved down here a couple years ago , 
did you ? 
where did you all move from ? 
did you ? 
we love it up there . 
that 's where i grew up . 
but we like it down here pretty good . 
i think you 'll like it better , 
but , of course it 's hard when you do n't have any family around . 
we got two kids that are under two 
and it 's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them . 
it 's hard on your folks , too , 
i know . 
supposed to be . 
that 's right . 
i do n't , 
a friend of mine 's dad was a program manager up there 
i do n't either . 
my wife does . 
but , it 's a good company . 
but , anyway , we 're supposed to be talking about boats , 
so back to boats . 
tell me the last time you went for a boat ride . 
that 's boating . 
that had to have been fun . 
it was fun , 
it was fun . 
are we paying too much in taxes , 
and are we getting what we pay for ? 
what 's your opinion ? 
it 's kind of a broad subject , 
i think there are some areas where we , pretty well get our money 's worth , 
but i also think there are a lot of areas especially in federal government , where we 're short changed . lot of money spent for things that are not used 
and i was in the air force 
and there was equipment at every base i was ever on that was just going to waste . 
it was just sitting and rusting 
i tend to agree with you . 
when it comes to government spending , there are so many studies done that do n't mean anything 
and it 's nice to know something does n't work or something does n't exist , 
but , it could be put to more practical use . 
and i think that it 's a tone of our times that politicians are into themselves more than they are into doing something worthwhile for the people they represent , which is really unfortunate . 
that is true . 
i agree with you in that area . 
and i read how our politicians voted each week in the paper . 
and it 's interesting how the votes vary 
and what they ran on in platform do n't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate or congress , whatever . 
and do n't really respond to people who write them and call them 
and unless they 're in the limelight and under pressure . 
so 
i think we get short changed on that . 
that 's very true . 
what state do you live in ? 
i work for school district 
and it has hurt us a lot . 
but i think , especially big government , tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it . 
and i do n't , 
that 's just not true . 
i do n't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or problem solving skills . 
i think there are too many things that money ca n't buy that are important as far as education is concerned . 
that 's true . 
what school district do you work for ? 
we 're comparable . 
i think we have got it on the line , do n't we . 
our taxes went up tremendously . 
and it 's not going to get any better . 
it 's going up and up and up . 
i remember there was about four , five years ago . 
is that incredible ? 
that 's the biggest mess i 've ever heard of . 
how can you justify raising anybody 's salary if you have to lay people off ? 
but i 'm not going to complain because we all got a pay raise this year . 
you all got a pay raise this year . 
is that correct ? 
i think the teachers did , 
and i do n't know about administrators . 
and i was an administrator , 
so i do n't get a raise anymore . 
my pay does n't change . 
are you on the early retirement ? 
are you enjoying it ? 
very much . 
course , i still work two part-time jobs . 
so , it 's not really total retirement . 
let 's see , 
i 'm twenty . 
how old are you ? 
i 'm older . 
older . 
older than you are . 
we are supposed to talk about places we like to go . 
so i 'm going , 
and where are you calling from ? 
where 's your favorite place to go ? 
my grandparents live there . 
that 's generally our usual summer vacation . 
that 's where i 'd like to go . 
mainly just being with family is it . 
we just hang out 
and my grandparents have a pool 
so we go swimming 
pretty hot is n't it , in the summer ? 
but we keep cool just by going swimming 
and it 's fun to be with my cousins . 
they 're up there also , my grandparents and my cousins . 
that 's good . 
have you ? 
in fact , i just got some reservations . 
i 'm going to go for almost two weeks this winter . 
actually i lived there , 
so i was there longer , 
but two weeks is the longest vacation i 'll have ever taken there , 
so i 'm kind of looking forward to that one . 
in march . 
we 're going to go in march after my children 's birthdays and get all that business out of the way . 
it 's very cold . 
so , do you travel a lot 
do we travel a lot ? 
i was a travel agent . 
i have been up until just a few months ago . 
but i 'm thinking of going back to work . 
so you know a lot of good vacation spots , 
i know a lot of good places to go . 
that 's your favorite ? 
it is my favorite . 
and i 'd like to take him there . 
but he 's traveled all over the united states 
and i have n't . 
i have n't been down south . 
have you been there ? 
i have n't . 
where do you live ? 
but we 've had some pretty nice weather . 
so that 's a pretty good deal . 
i do . 
do you ? 
not only and best 
but i 'm my best customer . 
since we 're not supposed to talk about this , though , is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream ? 
do you know ? 
i do n't , 
i have that , too . 
i need something , 
i need more . 
than the intensive eye ? 
i did n't know if there was anything else . 
i think it 's a wonderful product . 
do you use it ? 
i do , 
we get free products every month 
that 's great . 
i 've worked there about a year . 
that 's good . 
are they good to work for ? 
they 're wonderful to work for . 
that 's great . 
so we 're supposed to be talking about places to go 
do you go to school ? 
do you ski ? 
i ski , 
i do n't . 
that 's great . 
pretty good . 
i do like to ski . 
pretty down there . 
i said i do like to ski . 
and it 's kind of nice being up here just because it 's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go . 
if you like that kind of thing . 
you 're a sophomore . or junior ? 
i am actually a junior . 
beginning of my junior year . 
you 're a junior . 
good for you . 
what are you studying ? 
nursing . 
good for you . 
you sound like a girl that has it together . 
i would just encourage you to do a little traveling , though , before you get married . 
because when you get married , you wo n't have the money or the time . 
you think , 
i know . 
do n't be in any hurry . 
i 'm not , 
i 'm not . 
i could have had that or a down payment on a new car 
and i took the trip . 
and it was great ? 
and we just had a ball . 
how long did you get to stay there ? 
six weeks . 
it was wonderful , 
so you should think about doing something like that . 
and she was there all winter semester . 
we 're supposed to discuss crime in the united states and what can be done with it . 
that 's a rather broad topic . 
they 're usually pretty broad anyway . 
where do you live ? 
and where ? 
that is so frightening . 
it is , 
do you have children in school ? 
mine are already in college now , 
my oldest is his first year in high school 
so we have all this to look forward to , 
and it is really frightening to think that you ca n't even send them to school in safety . 
but when you ca n't even , send them on their normal activities in safety , it 's really frightening . 
that 's true . 
they 're coming down on the principal , 
but i really do n't know what they can do . 
it 's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs 
and i really do n't know what can be done . 
i just do n't understand of course , in my little world , how guns could be so available . 
i do n't either , 
but apparently they just really are . 
but my son comes home and tells me that he hears kids talk about having guns 
and someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun . 
and it just scared me to death 
and they called the police 
and nothing happened , 
but it could have easily . 
maybe that 's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution . 
maybe so . 
and people do n't do anything . 
and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help . 
but nobody did anything . 
i just ca n't imagine that . 
they heard someone calling for help . 
nobody even called the police to say i hear a strange screaming 
i do n't blame people with today 's society about going out to help themselves . 
i can see especially if you heard screams from a house or something , not going over there maybe , because it could be dangerous , 
but certainly i ca n't understand not calling the police . 
and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention . 
i think you 're right there . 
i guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business , 
but i think that 's real dangerous 
and i do n't know . 
i try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of what 's around them 
and , if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble , just get out of it or call for help , whichever . 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know , 
i ca n't say they do n't care , because people just have to care about another person . 
maybe this thing , with the child at school , maybe that will make people think a bit more and take some steps to correct it . 
i do n't know , 
it really is frightening . 
let me ask you , 
he did n't have a license for the gun ? 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know the details . 
this was not a child that was on the team . 
it was someone that , just kind of showed up at the field . 
it was a student age person , 
and where are you from ? 
nice , 
that 's neat . 
television shows ? 
that sounds good . 
i do n't watch too many , 
but we can try it . 
are you ready to start ? 
sure am . 
just a minute . 
i guess we 're recording now . 
what are your favorite television shows ? 
so if there 's no one else around it 's just me and i have a chance to listen to something , i 'll turn that on , 
but just for the conversation factor , i think , 
and then i think i enjoy when i catch it designing women sometimes , 
i love that show . 
do you ? . 
that is great . 
it 's fun . 
and then there 's a new one that started out that i 've caught a couple of times called good and evil . 
i heard they just canceled that . 
i read in today 's paper they just canceled that show . 
it is a real different one . 
it 's different . 
have you seen the show called home front ? 
i have n't watched that . 
it 's really good . 
and it 's set in post world war two times 
it 's really interesting . 
sounds neat . 
it is , 
it 's really well written . 
what station ? 
i do n't even know , to tell you the truth . 
what other shows do you like ? 
she comes on later 
and i usually have kids around so i do n't end up watching that one is the only problem i have with it , i guess . 
but i work full-time now and ca n't catch those anymore . except when i 'm home sick , 
and now when i watch them , i think , why did i ever watch those ? 
that 's right . 
they 're stupid . 
so when i did watch them i was addicted to them every day . 
but not anymore . 
that can happen . 
so do you know of any other shows in the even , or something that you enjoy ? 
tonight i 'm looking forward to seeing golden girls . 
that 's always fun . 
i like that show . 
it 's exciting , 
we 're winning , 
so that 's really exciting . 
i also , course , like to catch the news during the evening hours 
but it 's a little tough because that 's when i 'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time . 
so , usually i do n't get a whole lot of news watching in . 
we 'll catch our news that way . 
watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather 's going to be like . 
lately , i have n't been catching it because of my work schedule . 
i ca n't remember the last time i saw it . 
it 's been a while . 
i do n't know if we 've talked our full three minutes or not . 
i do n't know , 
sometimes they come on and say . 
that 's right . 
it was really interesting . 
it is interesting . 
just doing this as a fund-raiser for our church . 
that 's nice . 
so it kind of makes it easy to do a little something for it . 
what kind of house do you live in ? 
it sounds like ours are pretty similar . 
i live in one , 
i do n't have a swimming pool . 
i think it 's pretty much typical for this area . 
it is . 
have you been living there very long ? 
i 've been in the house about twelve and a half years . 
so you 've been there longer . 
let 's see , 
it 's been six and a half years ago , 
we bought the lot and had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications 
so , we 've been here a little over six years now . and have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in . 
my husband got his big garage . 
we have a three car garage , that he has a big work area in 
and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines 
and , so he has all the work space he needs . 
that sounds interesting . 
i bet he 's enjoyed having it that way 
because 
it is , 
and that 's why we decided to build . 
we looked at things that were already built 
and if the house was large , it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have . 
then , most of them do n't have a three car garage . 
they 're kind of rare . 
so we put a three car garage in . 
but , even if they had three car garages , they did n't have a work space . 
all of it was taken up with just car space . 
and so he has a big landing area that 's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on . 
we 've just got a two car garage , 
sounds like our husbands have similar interests . 
mine does not work on cars , 
i see . 
that 's nice that it 's not in your house . 
it really is . 
because they have a lot of things of their own , 
i do n't know , 
it ended up i got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something . 
so i did n't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would . 
we still have a son and daughter in college that come home . 
and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband 's family come . 
his parents come 
and also the kids have friends who come and stay 
and so it seems like it 's always used as a bedroom . 
all three of my daughters are married , 
but , i do n't know , 
i understand . 
and we 've got grandchildren now , 
so when they come , they have to have a place . 
that 's true 
and you do n't want them to not be able to come because there 's no room . 
that 's right , 
you sure do n't . 
at times i keep thinking , though , that might be kind of nice . 
i have n't reached that point yet . 
i 've heard people say that . 
but my middle son is engaged , 
my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while . 
he 's out of college and has a good job , 
so he could afford to get married but , is not engaged yet , 
and my daughter 's been going with the same boy for a while , 
but she 's still in college 
and we 're just as happy for her to finish her education first . 
that 's what she plans to do . 
i do n't blame you for that . 
i hope so . 
i have the three girls 
and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls . 
a whole new world . 
and i enjoy them coming , but for short doses . 
i can understand . 
they know everything . 
but , they 're fun . 
i just watch them . 
i never did put things up when my kids were little 
and i have n't with them . 
i try to teach them not to get into things . 
that 's the same thing that i did . 
i hope i 'll be able to do the same with grandchildren . 
i think that once you do that , your children kind of develop the same attitudes . 
at least my daughters have . 
they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up . 
so it 's worked pretty well . 
i do n't really think anything 's been broken . 
every now and then we have to kind of go and say , do n't bother this . 
but , all in all , they mind pretty well . 
what kind of roof does your house have ? 
here i 'm getting off the subject . 
we 're supposed to talk about crime in the city . 
and seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays , does n't it ? 
statistics , obviously , vary greatly . 
it is , 
but i was listening to the news the other day 
and they said they thought a lot of it , the reason it was up so was because so many people are without work nowadays , 
economy 's so bad . 
do you really believe that ? 
it 's been up every year for many years 
and the economy has n't been , this bad for so long , has it ? 
that 's a good point . 
that 's just what they quoted over the news . 
i do n't know if i believe that or not , 
but , it does seem up 
what kind of newspaper do you get down there ? 
what kind ? 
i think we got a pretty good newspaper . 
we have two , the morning news and the times herald . 
morning news seems to have the largest circulation . 
it 's a locally owned paper . 
the herald is owned by the times out of l a , or somewhere . 
do they play up the local crime angles 
they do n't , 
not really , 
they do n't play it up , i do n't think . 
but there is too much of it too many homes broken into . 
last year sometime our home was broken into . 
so this is a topic of personal interest . 
but , so many in our neighborhood had been , 
so you saw this happening in your neighborhood 
and you figured it would n't happen to you . 
sort of . 
and i never did get a security system , 
but since that happened , i certainly have . 
what kind of system do you have ? 
, with all the doors and the infrared motion detector . 
pretty standard . 
is this one with some company that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff ? 
it 's monitored and all that . 
is that a necessary feature to have somebody at the other end of the line 
or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise ? 
i think the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice . 
i really do . 
but this deal that was part of it for three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever . 
the monitoring is not that bad , though 
several times you 'll hit the wrong key , not intentionally or something 
and they call back pretty quickly , 
so i think it 's all right . 
to answer your question i think , that is a pretty good deterrent in itself , 
so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system . 
supposedly . 
how does it do that ? 
who knows . 
but that 's a selling point . 
and i think it probably does these things supposedly pretty good . 
they sure advertise so many of them nowadays . 
but do n't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there ? 
i 'm not saying it 's any higher than anybody else 's . 
or not here , 
but the statistics seem to say that . 
i do n't know . 
i think it 's the murder capital of the country now . 
is that right ? 
i would gather probably from drugs . 
and i think that 's the reason it 's so high everywhere . 
years ago , you thought , these little small cities and all , would n't have that problem , 
but they do . 
we 've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it as anyone . 
so , what 's the solution ? 
that 's a good question . 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know what the solution is . 
i really do n't . 
but they have n't seemed to have changed anything . 
and nothing seems to change . 
but , they want to buy it , 
supply and demand . 
long as somebody wants to buy it , somebody going to provide it for them . 
so , i do n't know what the solution is , 
i really do n't . 
i do n't think anyone does , in fact . 
just to let you know , i have two children of my own . 
i 've got two boys one four year old and one two years old , 
so i 'm just starting out . 
that 's quite a spread . 
same husband , everything . 
that 's great . 
one of the things that i like to do with my boys when i get home is , i like to try and spend a lot of time with them . 
they 're not very old , 
so they could n't do a whole lot , yet . 
but they like to spend time with me . 
we just do various things , nothing really . 
they like to be outside as much as possible . 
but the weather 's trying to turn now 
you know what i meant with rain . 
what , 
i have to answer a business phone . 
i hate to do it on this call . 
that 's okay . 
a r e , 
it was just a recorded message , on our business phone anyway . 
i 'm sorry , 
keep going . 
it 's okay . 
so that was the thing that i noticed that , i know a lot of friends that we have , they have a tendency to do the same thing . 
and seeing as you 've got some older children , i 'm wondering , how did you handle that , when they were growing up ? 
there was not nearly as much of it . 
in fact , i think things were quite a bit different . 
when my big kids were little all the mothers were home . 
the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around 
and then when they felt like it , they went out to play when they were little like that . 
and i think it 's gotten very different . 
or you got some cartoons 
and that was it , 
but they were never that interested in it anyway . 
they 'd take their trucks out in the backyard go out and play and stuff . 
but , we always did just . 
we did a lot of stuff like that with our kids . 
and , course , when they got bigger they were both quite into sports 
and so whatever they would do , we 'd go along with 
and a girl is very different . 
a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping . 
so , they 're very , very different , 
last night was a band concert 
one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station 
that 's nice . 
we go down there fairly often for a weekend for family get-togethers and stuff like that . 
that 's great . 
that 's great . 
and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older . 
just getting out in the front , and just being outside is good for them 
because they like just being outside . 
i think , our kids just always dearly loved that , 
course , when our big ones were little , we lived up north 
so it 's very different 
that 's true , 
do you have a pet ? 
i have two cats . 
and two fish . 
two cats , 
you 're lucky . 
your two fish . 
and what do you have ? 
you know , how , sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing . 
but to me , he belongs up in the farm 
does he sleep in your house ? 
and then he goes out for the day . 
but this is a beautiful dog 
and he is wonderful with our little girls 
and this is huge . 
course , when he runs around the yard , he just digs , 
he does n't know that he 's tearing up things , 
but he does . 
and the worst part that i had with him was when he was about eight months old 
and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one , 
and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour . 
and i came home 
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall . 
and it was in the floor 
and i just about lost it 
and i called 
and i said , come home and get your dog . 
and i wish you had told me , 
he kept picking at it 
the tile in the kitchen 
and picked a hole in it . 
and i told my husband , i said it 's either me or the dog , 
he loves this dog 
and he 's a good dog , 
so it 's one of those things i 'm just having to get used to 
and that 's why i laughed when they called with the topic . 
i thought , do i have a pet . 
but , i grew up with cats 
i love my cats . 
before i even got married i had my cat . 
she 's old . 
then you broke your heart . 
it was awful , 
it was just awful . 
and she just sat there on my lap . 
she just waited 
it was awful . 
that makes me feel so bad . 
and she just liked his shoes 
and he 'd have these hundred dollar shoes . 
it was just bad . 
and it was something . 
that 's awful , 
i never heard of that before . 
it was terrible . 
she must have known he did n't like her or something . 
or the smell or something . 
and i would bar the closet doors , and would clean the carpets 
it was just awful . 
does your cat sleep in the house ? 
that was very funny . 
they are house cats . 
i have two cats right now . 
they sleep with my kids . 
it does n't do anything . 
i 'm not going to have a dog . 
we 've had two dogs 
and they both got ran over . after we had them for several years , just nice little outside dogs 
were just my kids ' friends , 
they would go with me when i would go running 
and the last one got hit as she was following one of my sons across the road to the school . 
it was awful . 
but they do dig up and they just wreck things 
and i 'm not a dog person . 
they do wreck things . 
i 'm not either . 
i 'm not either 
i would n't want a lab . 
it sounds beautiful , 
he 's beautiful 
but it 's just one of those concessions , i just had to make , 
but i kind of ignore him . 
and it 's freezing 
and people are doing their fires 
and i brought him in because he 's just a wet mess out there 
and he 's in the laundry room with this little carpet square 
and he 's just huddled up like , if you 'll be nice to me , i wo n't make any trouble . 
and how old are your girls ? . 
it always smells of cedar 
i think they 're cutting us off . 
somebody 's trying to cut in on my line 
and i do n't want to answer . 
i 'll just wait . 
i 've got incoming calls 
i hate to cut it off , 
i think they would cut us off , 
i understand . 
so we 'll just wait . 
whoever it is will call back . 
they 'll cut us off pretty soon . 
it 's somebody calling for my kids , 
i know . 
actually , it 's my son , 
i know it is . 
my older boy . he never likes to come home from school . 
anyway that 's what we have , 
and i 've tried to start a fish tank 
and i keep losing all my fish . 
in the salt water ? 
just regular water . 
do you repair your own car ? 
i try to , whenever i can . 
i tell you what , 
count your blessings because it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves . 
although i 'll tell you , 
over the years the cars get more complicated . 
that 's why i do n't do as much as i 'd like . 
because they 've gotten complicated have n't they ? . 
is that right ? 
it got to be pretty straightforward to understand 
and i just ca n't keep up . 
i agree . 
i never was too mechanically inclined , 
course , they do n't use points anymore . 
that 's right . 
and now brakes , i 've always done a lot of changing brakes . 
i do n't anymore , 
but i have a lot of times . 
i understand . 
my last car repair actually had to do with brakes 
and it 's one i did not do myself . 
took it to be inspected 
and that did n't do the trick 
it probably slipped loose , did n't it ? 
actually that was n't even eventually the problem . 
i did everything that i could think to do . 
and , eventually i brought it up to a place called just brakes 
there 's disc brakes 
they ended up having to pound it out . 
and the other one it was just frozen solid , 
so i ended up having to buy one 
and all total , it was just under two hundred dollars , believe it or not , to get all that done . 
it really was n't quite , as bad as you thought , was it ? 
actually , i think it was a lot of money , 
it was a lot of money , 
it got to the point where i did n't know what was going on 
you had to have the help , did n't you ? 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
do you still do much work on them , then ? 
i do . 
and , whenever i can , i do try . 
actually , i 'd say this . 
disposal is a problem . 
that is one problem , 
but also these fast oil change places , you just ca n't beat them . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
that , 
i 've quit doing that myself . 
but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil . 
that 's right . 
but 
and the main reason . 
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago . 
they 've statewide raises , 
they raise ours constantly . 
we just passed a new one , 
and we had passed a provisional one that if they did locate here we would raise our taxes . 
but at least we thought we 'd get something back from that . 
how do you feel about taxes ? 
it seems like a big politics game 
up here , last year , the governor was up for re-election 
so he said the budget was fine , 
the state did n't have any money 
and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money 
so they raised all our taxes . 
and now it 's election time again 
so they 're trying to lower them . 
so they 're just talk about lowering them 
but they never do , 
they just keep raising them . 
i 've never seen taxes really go down . 
me neither . 
actually they 're going to here because they did n't have a budget for so long 
so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year 
and they 're going to lower it for next year . 
i guess they figure they 're going to make up for all they did n't get when they should have had a budget . 
i hope they put that in writing . 
they say they 're going to lower , 
but i 'll see . 
i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and that the rich are not paying their share 
and of course the poor ca n't afford it either , 
i 'm a middle class person income wise anyway 
and i get tired of supporting the whole country . 
so do i . 
i 'm middle class barely , 
but i do n't think the rich are paying not enough , 
i think they 're paying too much . 
you think the rich are paying too much ? 
if you 're in the three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month that 's ridiculous . 
why bother working ? 
i 'm talking about the really rich . 
they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make . 
that would be fair . 
i 'll go along with that , 
no loopholes or anything . 
i think that would be fair . 
no big elaborate laws that call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review . 
it 's just you make this , you pay ten percent . 
if you make a hundred dollars , you pay ten percent , 
if you make a million dollars , you pay ten percent . 
that 's the way our state tax is here . 
i think it 's pretty fair . 
our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal . 
and they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate . 
and you withhold no matter what you do , 
they withhold what they 're supposed to 
and at the end of the year it 's not enough . 
so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out . 
but it 's been that way for the last probably ten years . 
i guess you have to check yes 
or you come down to the end of the year 
and you do n't have it to give it to them . 
unless you have a lot of deductions . 
but if you have a lot of federal deduction , it ends up hurting you state wise . 
you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal 
and it 's just ridiculous . 
but , i do n't know . 
and that is a chunk . 
i 'll say . 
what i believe is one of the major things that is wrong with our public school system is that we do not have enough discipline 
and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now . 
i agree with that . 
when i went to school , i know i was scared to death about being disciplined , 
you were ? 
and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different . 
i did not see anybody in my classrooms , when i was going to school , act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom . 
from what i understand , they act up pretty bad . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
what grade is your daughter in ? 
my daughter 's in the fourth grade 
and there 's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom , where the teacher can not teach 
and when i went to school that just was n't put up with . 
they always had a paddle in our school . 
they just do n't do that any more . 
i know . 
but the school system 's afraid of getting sued and all sorts of lawsuits because of things like that . 
and , i also believe even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system , that the teachers are still underpaid 
and we still do n't have enough money put in toward public school . 
and i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more , that maybe that could solve some of our problems . 
was n't that what part of the lottery is going to go for , if we approve it ? 
supposedly that 's what it 's suppose to go for , 
and we 'll just have to wait and see whether that 's approved or not . 
i do n't know your feelings toward that . 
i guess we should n't get into that 
and what else 
i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire . 
i have heard stories from other parents that i know of that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs , 
i 've heard some horrible , horrible stories about high school teachers 
and to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school . 
that 's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system . 
with what they have to work with , i think they 're doing a pretty good job right now . 
i do too , 
i think they 're doing real good job . 
but , then , what do i know , 
you do n't have any children in school ? do n't have any kids . 
i do n't have any kids . 
none at all . 
so this is probably a real hard subject for you . 
i guess we can discontinue our call now . 
it was a joy in talking with you . 
it was good talking to you too . 
we 'll see you , 
i 've never done it before , 
so i guess that 's all i have to do . 
i guess so . 
i 've been called several times , 
and i pushed in my number , 
they kept saying you have the invalid code 
and then i found out that my new phone was n't working right . 
so this is the first time i 've even done it . 
i wonder how long it 's going to be on for . 
i mean , this whole thing , 
for two months or something , 
do you know ? 
i do n't know . 
back to crime , 
i guess we 're supposed to talk about that . 
they say what aspect are you worried about , 
i think at this point , i for one am worried about every aspect . 
there 's so much going on here . 
that , and in the schools , too starting to put metal detectors in , 
i know . 
not that i 'm aware of . 
i just heard last week at that one school , they started putting them in because there was that one shooting 
we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the school grounds after school . 
is that right ? 
and the one boy killed himself a few years ago , in a grade school , 
so these kids do n't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any neighborhood , does n't seem like . 
not at all . 
it 's kind of scary to think , you send your child to school 
and you wonder if he 's going to get shot . 
we did n't have to worry about that before . 
i know . 
what next ? 
i know , 
it 's been out of hand for a while , 
and it just continues to get worse . 
and we ca n't really depend on the police to solve all this , 
they just ca n't do it . 
i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent 
and how we going to bring that back together . 
i agree , 
i think that 's where it stems from , is that 
and you 've got a lot more women that are working nowadays that are n't home with the children 
and that may impact it as well . 
i think so , 
and then there 's a drop in the training of morals , really . 
some of these young kids you read about , just does n't bother them to kill someone at all 
i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals would n't kill somebody in cold blood . 
they do n't think twice about it . 
i think it was just rare , 
i really do . 
and he wanted to marry her , 
and she would n't marry him 
and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both , 
himself and her ? 
but the point of the story is that , that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers , all over the country for weeks 
i bet . 
i know , 
it 's just another killing . 
i was watching some show the other day , 
and they were talking about mass murderers 
lots of their picture and life story and everything . 
and then you get to their life story , 
they came from a broken family 
this person had mental problems 
, 
i know , 
how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible , 
is that right ? 
i think it was on a hard copy , 
she was a real attractive blond girl , in her freshman year of college 
and some boy she tried to get rid of , he was in his twenties , 
i remember seeing that , 
remember that ? 
i saw that on hard copy . 
is that right ? 
can you believe it , 
i 'm trying to remember , 
and he just shot them himself and her . 
i remember seeing that . 
is n't that weird ? 
there 's just too many crazy people out there these days . 
i know , 
and the police are not going to do anything until they 've committed some sort of a crime . 
he was just begging her on the phone , 
that 's not doing anything . 
i think they 're kind of ambivalent , really . 
i just have a feeling that we 've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations . 
half the time we do n't know who to support . 
that , and maybe it 's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with , countries like that that depend on us so much without running their country for them 
that 's just it . 
it 's got to be tough , 
but you still have to let them know how you feel . 
no matter which side we take , we 're going to have supporters 
and like you said , they 're such small countries , that we 're bound to upset somebody , 
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance . 
and of course i 'm sure we have some enemies down there who would n't care what happened to us , 
but that 's a tough deal , 
that 's true . 
maybe it 's , i 'm reflecting how i feel about it , 
but i have a feeling that we really do n't understand basically the competing factions in lot of those countries 
and it 's still going on , 
that 's about the lump sum of it . 
and she was from a relatively wealthy family , 
what 's his face , 
i 'm blank on it . 
you know who i 'm talking about . 
i can see his face forget his name . 
i know it , 
when he came into power , he basically just took everybody 's property just assigned it to himself . 
kind of nationalized it for himself , 
dictator , 
basically a dictator fascist . 
and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing , 
unstable . 
i think it 's long overdue 
there 's so much difference in the economies of the two countries , 
i have a problem with whether it 's going to work or not , 
but it seems like there 's a lack of honesty in foreign policy a lot of the times . 
the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule , 
and we 've had our way of life , 
tell me what you like to do . 
i collect antique tools for one thing , 
i 'm sort of in an antique business , 
but it 's a little sideline , part time thing . 
it 's really neat . 
and course i 've been working on it for five years , 
but how wonderful . 
are you close to getting it done ? 
of course there 's still a lot of work to be done , 
and then when you get the shell finished you still have a lot of stuff to do inside , 
are you going to move your whole family over there then ? 
actually i 'm not even sure , 
i may , 
escape . 
but it 's beautiful , 
it 's eastern hardwood forest , 
but it 's mostly oaks 
how beautiful , 
and it 's pretty flat there ? 
but , it 's low hills , 
i liked the hills and the trees , 
except for time in service . 
i had never been there , 
that 's pretty neat . 
my sisters both seem to like it pretty well . 
at which one ? 
he 's admissions director . 
it 's just north of me here . 
he 's got a job there 
and this is his first year , 
so , it 's been a real interesting thing for them . 
that 's great . 
but they seem to like it okay . 
i think they 're too far away from me , 
but maybe some day they can get closer , 
we 'll see . 
pretty good trip . 
i 'm mother of four , 
so basically i 'm just , real busy with my kids right now in sports , 
and , i substitute at the schools part-time . 
that 's great . 
i am a travel agent at heart , 
i love traveling and being involved of that and finding out more , 
but , it 's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband , 
so i reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school , 
so i 've been librarian all this week , which has been real interesting , 
and i 'm enjoying it . 
i 'm around my kids 
and 
that 's pretty easy substituting is n't it ? 
it 's great , 
it 's great , 
and what else do i do , 
and i enter things in our little state fair , 
and that 's pretty fun . 
that 's great . 
i play tennis . 
i love tennis too 
do you ? 
and i ski , 
do you ski ? 
we snow ski . 
that 's great . 
have you ever been there ? 
wonderful place . 
i can hardly wait to get up there . 
me , too . 
are you guys getting snow ? 
we 're to get one to three inches tonight . 
we are on the dry side of the mountains . 
and going over that pass is just a real nightmare . 
i can imagine . 
and we ski . 
my children all ski 
and then we 've gone to sun valley several times , 
since i went to school , 
have n't been there , 
have n't either . 
city , 
and your kids all ski ? 
not all of them . 
my kids are all grown . 
but my youngest son is a skier . 
that 's great . 
when they 're skiing they 're fearless , 
i do n't do a lot of it . 
i do love to fish . 
good , 
maybe i can learn something . 
i do n't know how much you can learn . 
i 'm not so sure i 'm good at it , 
but i do enjoy doing it . 
do you ? 
it is fun , what little i do . 
i told my husband last night when i had called and they had , told me that this was a topic , 
he said , i do n't think that 's the different kinds of fishing they 're talking about . 
i hope it is , 
there 's not a whole lot of different kinds . 
that 's about the only kind i know how to do . 
but we have a lot of lakes here in this area 
and i do a lot of fishing for bass . 
we have a couple of lakes in our area that are just filled with good sized bass . 
it all depends on what i 'm fishing for , and the time of day . 
it sounds like you do quite a bit of it . 
i do . 
there 's a lake maybe two or three miles from here , 
and it 's very convenient on afternoons when i want to just get away and sit and think . 
fishing 's a good way to do that , 
and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing . 
do you have a boat ? 
i do n't . 
and we use that sometimes . 
i wish i had a boat , 
but i do n't . 
the ones around here are so big , that you can fish off the dock 
but unless you have a boat you ca n't really get into where they call the good fishing holes . 
that 's the same way here , is n't it ? 
is it ? 
and the lake is beautiful , 
and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish , 
but actually catching fish to eat per se , you do n't really do much of that right there . 
i catch a lot of little old perch 
so it 's so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit 
but it 's kind of fun . 
but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes . 
i would be afraid of that . 
and i ca n't think of a time that i 've been fishing that i have n't run into one or two of them . 
do they ever get on your hook ? 
occasionally i 'll catch an eel on a hook , but never the snakes . 
are they poisonous snakes ? 
we have a lot of cotton mouth , 
so 
they are , definitely 
so i seem them swimming by every once in a while . 
i think i 'd be a little bit afraid of those . 
they 're certainly ugly . 
it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that . 
great big snake , 
and of course , it scared the women to death , 
but the men come out and said that 's only a king snake , 
it wo n't really hurt you . 
but it looked so bad 
and it was so big , that it might not would have hurt us , but we sure felt like it was hurting us , just being there . 
definitely . 
but they 're scary looking . 
do you have bass ? 
that 's pretty much the same way here . 
they have a lot of bass tournaments . 
we have those . 
inevitably , if i enter one of those , i never catch a thing . 
i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it . 
we 've never entered a tournament or anything . 
we 're not that big into fishing , 
early in the morning there 'll be all the boats going out , 
and they 'll say , there 's a big bass tournament this weekend , 
and all those people are here for the tournament . 
i guess that you 'd call it really sport fishing , 
they 're really into it to try to win . 
definitely . 
certainly here they are . 
but it 's a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around . 
the peace and calmness is really relaxing . 
it 's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish . 
that 's what i do a lot . 
i 've never tried taking a book with me . 
i 'll have to try that one of these days . 
when they first said the subject , my mind went kind of blank . 
i thought , i have n't taken anything back for a long time . 
i have n't either , 
i hate returning things . 
i have a friend who , if she likes something , is n't sure what size somebody might need , will buy it in every color and size and take everything back again . 
it 's a game to her , 
but i do not like to do that . 
i consider it kind of a waste of my time . 
and so i 'm usually pretty careful when i shop 
and i also usually have checked over things if it 's an appliance or something to make sure it has the features in it that i want . 
and we 've had it for a while , 
but all of a sudden it just was n't working , 
and it looks like there 's a part missing from it . 
my husband opened it up and whatever , 
and of course we do n't have the receipt any more , 
so we ca n't take it back . 
of course , 
but , i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long 
just to get you by five years 
and then you 'll throw it away rather than have it fixed 
we 're a wasteful society , for sure . 
that 's true , 
and you usually get what you pay for . 
and they were ten dollars , 
and we expected them to work nice for the little kids , 
and they did n't work worth anything . 
we took those back , 
and that 's about that 
all that were taken back in ages . 
you pretty well know what you 're getting ahead of time , 
and if you buy a good one , you should n't have too much of a problem with it , 
it 's hard . 
and the car would go 
and it would stop 
and we went round and round with the manufacturer and everything , 
at first i thought of food because that 's mainly what i buy , it seems like , 
and i still do n't have anything to do there , 
but i think , too , a lot of people do n't buy their warranties either because they know that when it 's that old they 're going to buy a new one , 
i think that 's true , 
and now we generally do n't buy a warranty , because you think at least for the first couple of years , nothing should go wrong with it . 
my husband is really good at fixing things , too , 
so he usually 
i do n't know if they 're making them better or not , 
it 's hard to say . 
i think they which makes things break easier , 
but i think the technology is better . 
i think technology is better , 
i 'm not sure . 
i think you 've got a good point with the plastic and that . 
about quality . 
i do n't think necessarily that , things are being made better , 
everything is so automated , 
and things can be made without a human hand ever touching it an awful lot of things , 
that 's true . 
so , if we get what we deserve . 
i do craft work and sell stuff at shows 
let me just start by asking what you think of this middle east affair we 've got going on ? 
i think that it 's time that we concentrate more on what 's going on within our own borders than what 's going on in the middle east . 
i have to agree with you there . 
just let these people fight it out 
i agree . 
we 've got so many domestic problems , 
and what does it cost these people over there . 
so how about the soviet union . 
what do you think 's going to happen there . 
the break ups ? 
i think that 's great . 
i 'm glad to see that , 
and so , i 'm not much in favor of it , 
but i 'm glad to see us advising them 
that does n't seem to cost a whole lot of money . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
but i 'm ready to have a president elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda , 
even if it does n't work , at least he is somebody who is working on that problem . 
so they do n't seem to have a clue . 
international is important , 
but we 've got a budget deficit that just wo n't go away unless it gets seriously addressed . 
and then there 's the homeless issue , 
and we would n't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we 're spending . 
i agree . 
once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the world bank , as far as aid is concerned , 
and i think there 's a limit , 
and we passed it a long time ago . 
i agree . 
we 've been writing off way too many country bad debts . 
that 's another thing i do n't understand is things like selling technology and even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt 
to me that just does n't make any sense , as much in debt as we are 
i know it . 
i do n't know . 
i think it 's definitely time for a change , 
but i do n't see anybody , 
it seems to be we 're turning into a black and white society , 
you either do it this way 
or you do it that way , 
and there 's no in between 
that 's right , 
you 're either liberal or you 're conservative , 
and it obviously is n't working . 
i think it would n't hurt , 
and i know the independent party 's been trying for years to get a real force in congress , 
but you 're right , 
and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel , i think we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed . 
i agree with you . 
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth , he just lines up people against him 
so , it 's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions . 
he 's the one of the two that votes , 
he 's one of the two . 
he 's , very ineffective , i think . 
let 's see , 
senators are in for six years 
and when did you guys vote him into office ? 
you 're stuck . 
we 're stuck with him for a little while longer , 
you keep up with current events ? 
somewhat . 
somewhat 
not , 
not as well as i would like to probably 
is that right ? 
but that 's the way it goes . 
what ? 
state college , 
do you , 
we 're not supposed to talk about that . 
we 're supposed to talk about current events . 
so i try to watch the news , 
and i read the newspaper , 
and i like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what 's going on in the world . 
i see . 
what particularly are you interested in ? 
little about everything . 
and then again not everything , 
but i like to know pretty well what 's happening . 
just the events that happen around the world interest me . 
stay in touch with it and feel like i know what 's going on . 
i have to say all three of my children , none of them are too interested in current events . 
i see . 
but i always have been 
and i stay up with it . 
but how do you , stay aware of most of the current events . 
some of both . 
i read the newspapers sometimes 
that 's good . 
and i read magazines , and such . 
you stay up with it pretty well , then . 
not that badly 
so i am interested in what 's going on , 
you 've been there 
and . 
you would be interested in it then . 
i follow it , 
i do n't just read everything about it , 
but i 'm always aware of what 's going on like that 
because it 's interesting 
and i do n't know , 
i feel sorry for those people down there , 
that 's true . 
they 've never really had a good leader , 
and i think it 's been better since he died , 
but it 's still been bad 
i 've read some things about him that he was n't too good himself . 
he did n't mind having people bumped off for certain things . 
i see . 
those people are so used to it 
i guess it 's the only thing that works . 
i think we 're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have 
i really do . 
sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme , 
the media does , 
but , that 's kind of understandable , because of course if you watch it more than once a day it 's the same thing over and over and over and over , 
and i listen to the radio 
so you hear so much , 
you get a little tired of it , 
but then again , so many people only catch it once a day , maybe 
i do n't believe it could be better 
i really do n't . 
i think it always could be better , 
but i , would agree that it 's pretty good . 
i do n't think so . 
i do n't think our news could be better . 
what else could they do to make it better . 
i do n't see anything that they could do . 
i do n't know . 
you always want to think everything can be improved upon 
i understand what you 're saying , 
but by trial and error over the years , i think they got it about as good as they 're going to get it . 
that may be so , 
nothing is perfect . 
i think that i 'm not always satisfied with how deep they dig into things and such . 
that 's true , 
i understand what you 're saying , 
and then again , i understand why they ca n't dig too much deeper , 
in fact that 's what i was doing when you called . 
that sounds interesting . 
i have material that i cut out , 
there 's this stuff called wonder under that you iron it on 
and you paint around it . 
i see . 
so , it 's real fun . 
i started doing it as just something fun to do , 
and now i 'm selling them 
how 's it going ? 
pretty good . 
i just started last week , 
and i sold seven . 
i was n't expecting that , 
that sounds great . 
somebody has to do it , 
that 's right . 
that 's correct . 
i kind of have hobby fads , i guess . 
when i was growing up i was into coin collecting , 
now my latest one is classic cars . 
almost had it done , 
and i went ahead and sold it . 
but it was fun . 
i really enjoyed it . 
how 'd you learn to do that to fix them up ? 
you just get a book that tells you how to do it or what ? 
all i did is i bought the car 
i was just in a supermarket 
and so i bought it 
and i just started ordering some parts 
i did n't do too much to the engine , because the engine was pretty good , 
just kind of do it . 
where 'd you get the car ? 
and i bought it up there before i moved down here . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
that sounds neat . 
let 's see . 
that about covers mine 
let 's see , 
i 'm a hobby person . 
i 've always done a lot of craft stuff . 
and , i collect dolls , 
. let 's see , 
what else ? 
i started collecting music boxes . 
i guess that 's a hobby . 
that is . 
that 's interesting . 
how many music boxes do you have ? 
probably about twenty . 
do they all play different songs 
or do some of them play the same song ? 
they all play different songs . 
that 's neat . 
what 's the most expensive one you bought ? 
the most expensive . 
i do n't know . 
i 've gotten all of them for gifts . 
that 's interesting . 
that 's true . 
i never collected those . 
that 's interesting , music boxes . 
i have dolls from all over too . 
that i started when i was a little girl , 
and i have a lot of dolls . 
people would always bring them when they go to the countries , 
i bought a doll everywhere we went , 
economy . 
it was great , 
it was quick . 
i was in high school , 
and i was in a tour , 
it 's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries , 
and it was called people to people , 
and we 'd stay in people 's homes , 
and then we got to also tour big cities , 
and i really enjoyed it . 
was that in high school 
or was that a college thing ? 
in was in high school . 
everything was rushed 
i bet . 
that 's true . 
that sounds real neat . 
i always thought i would , 
but who knows now . 
i got married 
and , maybe some day . 
maybe it 's one of those retirement things . 
there you go . 
he likes it all right . 
does he help out much 
do you have any pets ? 
i have a dog and cat now . 
what are their names ? 
which is the dog 
and which is the cat ? 
and liberty is the cat . 
wife and i , we have two cats . 
one 's real nice , 
she 's pretty wild . 
. ours are pretty calm . 
are they just house pets ? 
that 's what ours are too . 
our cat we got from the pound the night she was going to be put to sleep . 
so that 's why we call her liberty . 
that 's a nice story . . 
do you want to hear about my other animals i 've had ? 
i 've had rats , 
i 've had mice 
let 's see , 
i had a son that was an animal lover . 
it was litter trained 
and we had it perfumed 
and it was very aggressive . 
nobody came near it when he was there . 
i had a dog one time , 
but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to back up and get ready . 
one other question we had is , why do you have pets ? 
why , i do n't know , 
i think they 're kind of nice to have , 
i do n't know , 
when they sit up on your lap and stuff like that , just kind of enjoyable to have , 
i do n't know , 
i always said if i died i 'd come back as a dog . 
what do you think ? 
that 'd be the best way to be . 
do you like big dogs or little dogs ? 
and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went . 
so , when he died , we got a little one . 
almost cruel for him to walk . 
he could n't get up , 
he could n't walk , 
he was a hundred and twenty pounds , 
so it was a chore . 
so we said the next time around we 'd get something little that if something happened , it would be easier to carry . 
and then we 've had three cats in our married life , 
do you ? 
she 's the nice one . 
we used to live in an apartment 
and our cats never went outside , 
but the neighbors used to let their dogs out , 
and our neighbors were kind of slimy , 
and our cats wound up getting fleas from the apartment that we were in 
so , we had to flea bath them 
and it was an experience that they did n't enjoy at all . 
do n't even talk to me , 
when i was single i had gone away for the weekend , 
and he let her out , 
and my house was loaded with fleas , 
you walked in 
and your legs were just black . 
and we had such a time , and never got the cat back . 
i found it in the street . 
we have a tent , 
i guess my biggest memory is when we froze to death . 
we just did n't take enough blankets and whatever . 
and it got really cold at night , 
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning , 
and , we take along games that we can play with the kids , and just that kind of stuff . 
that sounds like fun . 
my dad would take us , 
there was four of us kids , 
he 'd take us , 
and it was always fun , 
because what i always remember is , my dad would let us pick our camp spot 
and it always had to be somewhere near a river so we could go fishing , 
and hopefully we 'd catch our supper , 
but we never did 
but it was always fun . 
mom was always prepared 
and she 'd bring along something , because tradition had it we would never catch anything , 
so we always had , something along to eat , 
and it was always an enjoyable experience . 
and there 's no hills , 
it 's flat , 
and then i was in high school , 
but by then , of course , i was able to catch some things , 
but , it was always fun . 
in the hills , you can see quite a few different animals , 
go ahead . 
and of course , there 's lots of mountains around there to camp in , and streams and stuff . 
i 'm not acquainted with any , 
but it 's just a lot of trees , 
it 's not too bad . 
i guess they could call them that , 
they 're not bad . 
but it sure beats driving a thousand miles , to find a mountain , i guess . 
that 's right . 
i see . 
you 're just trying to get over the culture shock still . 
i 'm still trying to find my way around . 
if i can get on central from anywhere , i 'm happy . 
really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring , and , in the fall . 
what do you do on your yard ? 
typical lawn stuff . 
comes back in the yard 
so you do n't have any one do your yard . 
you do it yourself ? 
i do it myself . 
we do too . 
have a lot of people trying to do it for me . 
is n't that the truth . 
i need the exercise , 
so what the heck . 
that 's right . 
my husband does the same thing , 
he does the yard , 
but i keep putting off learning . 
you 've got the right idea . 
that 's right . 
we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago , 
and put out yellow and bronze 
and they 're just gorgeous , 
and so then last week my mom comes in town , 
and i went , now you tell me . 
and we went out and covered them with a sheet , 
and they did okay that first night . 
but the second night we were at the movies and did n't do it , 
so i guess i 've lost them . 
i have n't gone out to check yet . 
i do n't blame you . 
i would n't want to look at them . 
listen , 
but the worst problem we 've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here . 
i guess it was about four years ago . 
and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it , 
it would just come off in the rake , down to the dirt . 
it took a lot of money and a lot of time , 
you think that 's what it was . 
we found them 
we found them . 
we dug under there about an inch 
and you could see them . 
they 're real fat little white things , 
and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring 
so occasionally i find them in the flower beds . 
they said that every yard has some 
i had some of that problem , 
but mine was freeze . 
that too , 
is that what you 're talking about ? 
i 'm still replacing that in the back , especially , under the trees 
kind of slow , and very expensive . 
and i bought about twenty of them . 
i guess you did too . 
it 's what they 've done in the spring or the fall . 
that was late , 
because i started to say , there 's different times they say it 's okay to do it . 
and i had to water it 
keep it damp . 
and they just live , 
they 're pretty tough , 
you can stand those . 
and usually it 'll do pretty well , 
but every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals 
same way , 
they warned me of that one finally . 
and we did n't know the difference . 
your list is growing , 
and my backyard , we had it really nice , 
i guess he 's three now , 
as long as he wo n't damage it , fine , 
and if there 's anything he 'll hurt , we just do n't put it out there any more . 
kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds , 
very much , 
you did . 
it did pretty well , 
and our garages come in from the alley 
so do ours , 
and it 's a little piece of land over there . 
what did you grow ? 
that is amazing . 
put them in a salad , though , 
and you say , i made it though , 
at least it 's mine . 
my personal opinion , i do n't mind paying taxes necessarily . 
i just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way . 
and that 's all tax money . 
when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much , it 's just billions of dollars 
that is just being thrown away . 
and then when you read about that they 're spending all the money on these studies that have no relevance whatsoever , 
but somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we 're paying , it 's not that we mind paying taxes , it 's that we 're paying too much for a lousy government . 
and i tend to agree with that . 
i 'm not really into what they 're doing per se , 
and i think there 's just too many levels of bureaucracy . 
i think it can be managed by less levels . 
i work with the state , 
it 's never the person that 's making a hundred thousand there . 
it 's always the person that 's making the least amount , 
and sometimes we 're running around there . 
i see these , supervisors running around having meetings . 
i really do n't know what they do . 
i sometimes wonder , are they really doing anything , 
i think we 're going to see a streamlining in the government . 
i do n't know what level , or how long it will take for the public in general to start saying , this is too much . 
we 're not going to pay any more , 
we 're not going to pay for this , 
and you 're out . 
i think we 're starting to see it a little bit now , 
but i think i do n't know what kind of input we 're going to get from the public and how they 're going to go about doing it . 
because i think we 're just getting taxed way too much . 
and that 's me not making a whole lot of money . 
they got so many hidden taxes , that it 's really hard to figure out how much you are paying , because , go to a grocery store , something like that , and you 're paying a little tax here 
gas , i do n't know about you guys , 
and you do n't realize , 
we got a sales tax . 
our sales tax is eight percent , 
and i do n't know what our gas tax is . 
i think it 's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon . 
so they 're hitting us up , 
and they may not raise it federally as much one year , 
but then they 'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever . 
it 's just you can see that your money is just not going that far . 
but they changed the deductions on you , 
and that just raises your taxes , 
they just get it a different way 
so to me , it did raise my taxes . 
you could tell just by how much money you have left over , 
and all of a sudden it 's eating me alive . 
i heard someone say that if they would just , if they cut back by so much percentage , it could throw back about six hundred dollars , on an average , six hundred dollars , 
i 'll let you start this time . 
how much do you like lawn and garden work ? 
what do you do ? 
that 's interesting . 
so , at this time of the year are you doing much garden work ? . 
mostly snow removal , which we 've had a lot of , 
but i do n't know , 
i guess growing up on the farm and that , i 've always had a big interest . 
when i have an area to do , i always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and everything . 
i love to work outside , really , 
and i enjoy flowers and stuff . 
i do n't do a whole lot of it at this exact point in my life because i have two teenage boys , 
and so they do all the lawn care , 
but i still take care of the flower beds and things like that . 
and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me , 
that 's terrible . 
and i really feel bad about it , 
so , they 're all gone at this point . 
everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has watering system . 
and so with that our lawns do stay pretty nice all summer , if you water . 
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack 
and i just think it 's ugly . 
they go dormant . 
those two . 
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer . 
they have to water an incredible amount . 
but those lawns look nice during the winter , 
but they almost stick out like a pretty thumb . 
and they just grow rocks 
and . that 's their gardening there . 
i guess as long as you can have some grass there . 
and we were taking care of lawns out there , 
and that particular year they had just tons of rain , 
and then , i know with all that moisture , a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems . 
that 's true . 
are you able to get sometimes a double crops of certain things in your garden ? 
i think people do . 
i do n't have a vegetable garden , 
i guess i never have here , actually , 
but , 
that 's one of my old favorites . 
so i 'll just ignore it . 
and now , i did like thirty something 
my daughter says nine oh two one oh . 
we like that one . 
that 's one of my favorites . 
and how old are you ? 
so you 're little bit younger than i am , 
but 
and i like it . 
i think it 's wonderful . 
it 's a good show . 
all of our kids are in sports , 
but that 's one that we watch . 
i like that , 
that 's a good show , too . 
very good . 
i did n't . 
it 's a good episode . 
the new character on there did . 
what time is it there ? 
it is twenty minutes to nine . 
i 'm twenty minutes to six here . 
three hours difference . 
what else do you like ? 
let 's see , 
i like a lot of different shows . 
let 's see , 
i like murder , she wrote . 
i never watched that ever in my entire life . 
a small bowl will be plenty . 
that 's mine . 
a small bowl will be better because it 's pretty fattening . 
talk to my daughter . 
all my children , 
i 've watched that for about twelve years . 
i 'm sure i watched it for more than that probably . 
twenty something . 
so that was a long time ago . 
she was my favorite character on there . 
i read the reason they killed her off was because they could n't settle a contract , 
and i said if they 're going to do that to her , i wo n't watch it . 
that 's great . 
i do like all my children , 
i do n't know . 
i like the people on it , i guess . 
i like it . 
i just wish they 'd bring some of the old characters back . 
tad 's going to come back , i bet , 
do you think ? 
i 'm sure he will . 
he 'll come back , show up at just the right moment . 
cliff 's on the young and the restless now . 
he is . 
so he 's out for good . 
he 's out for good . 
did they marry ? 
that 's how they left the show , but not in real life . 
and she 's happily married 
and that 's the reason she left the show . 
i guess she wanted a private life . 
i watch it maybe twice a month , 
so , i do n't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies . 
i watch . 
because i play lots of tennis 
and i 'm gone a lot , 
so , i do n't get to watch , 
i watch it everyday , religiously . 
i videotape it when i have to miss it . 
i used to be like that . 
i 'm that way about a lot of different shows . 
there 's two new characters on there . 
i do n't know if you know her or not . 
that 's a show i like . 
i do n't like her on it , 
i never have liked her , 
i just know which one she is . 
i never watch that one either . 
life goes on comes on about the time that we eat dinner , 
those are always pretty cute . 
murder , she wrote comes on opposite of that , 
and so , 
we like that real well . 
be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebody 's getting killed on it . 
i know . 
the kids already know who it is , 
i do n't know who it is , though , 
who is it ? 
ask them . 
ready to get started ? 
i think so . 
sort of an interesting topic since i just got back from lunch here . 
what did you have for lunch ? 
i 'm an officer in the air force , 
that 's interesting . 
so our topic is food today , 
if you 're having a dinner party , what would you serve ? 
do you want me to go first ? 
and then i usually have a little theme when i have a dinner party 
and let 's see what else . 
maybe some rolls and some rice or something like that . 
how does that sound ? . 
when is the party here ? . 
that would take some planning 
i do n't know 
it 's not a question of capability here to do something like that . 
it 's just there 's no motivation . 
that 's right . 
that sounds good too . 
i have three kids 
and usually we just have very plain kind of not very interesting meals . pizza and that all 
so once in a while when we do something like that it 's kind of fun , 
but it 's not a regular thing . 
are we supposed to talk for about five minutes , 
that 's what they are shooting for here . 
let 's see 
i live on a lake here , 
that 's a little more a casual thing . 
a , really good place to do entertaining like that . 
that sounds wonderful . 
i just have n't really tried a whole lot 
but i do n't know , 
let 's see . 
one time i did have a dinner party . 
i did n't know this was from all over the whole country . 
i see . 
it is . 
and i 'm originally from long island . 
upstate . 
upstate . 
is that where you are originally from around there ? 
and been all over the place . 
that 's interesting . 
let 's see . 
sometimes when i have a dinner party i 'll have , everybody bring something , 
and that 's real interesting because then you get different kinds of foods and new recipes 
and sometimes somebody will bring something that you really like , 
and get the recipe from them or whatever . 
they have some delicious , delicious things , 
and you boil them , 
maybe four chicken breasts , 
and you boil them until they are cooked . 
maybe thirty minutes 
what ? 
do you want to start ? 
it does n't matter . 
we 're discussing the capital punishment , i believe . 
you are right . 
i suppose i should have , 
i am pro capital punishment except that i do n't like the way it 's done . 
i guess , i hate to see anyone die 
but i guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse i do n't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives . 
i agree . 
capital punishment is necessary in many cases 
it 's not a deterrent , 
or our jails would not be so full . 
there would n't be so many people in death row . 
something not gruesome but something more where people know that it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people . 
if you committed a certain crime , you were going to receive a death penalty 
and it was going to happen to you . 
no stays of execution . 
no loopholes , 
and even that i do n't really know if that would help . 
notoriety . 
the double reason 
and also the fact of notoriety . 
they become well known . 
they are almost like a big star . 
but they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal . 
they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years . 
that they are going to write a book . 
they are going to go on talk shows 
that 's a reward for a heinous crime rather than having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life . 
that 's for sure . 
there 's exceptions to the rule 
but most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure i do n't like to see that . 
it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again . 
they will . 
not if he 's killed he ca n't , do it again . 
that 's correct , 
if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is executed . 
the death penalty . 
but the chances are not great that that will happen . 
but there 's a greater chance that he 'll be back out on the streets in twelve years . 
i guess i 'm also looking at beyond even that . 
i guess i been thinking about it 
and i do n't have a definite opinion 
but repeat crimes maybe not the more mild ones but more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people , and not just taking the money but beating them half to death . 
that 's right . 
just for pleasure too 
and i guess you 've got to look at something like that . 
do they deserve to remain on this earth too ? 
and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this . 
unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes , 
you would n't be able to under our system . 
china and a few other countries have a little different view of that . 
you get caught with dope there and you die , period . 
there is no appeals . 
what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day ? 
. i do n't like it when people listen to my phone conversations , like if they 're outside my door while i 'm talking in my room , or when people look through my things in my bedroom . 
that 's right . 
that is really an invasion of privacy . 
i find it very annoying when i 've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly , 
does that happen in your part of the country ? 
i come home 
definitely . 
and i am trying to get a few things done 
and i ca n't do anything but answer the telephone . 
but i wish i could put a stop to it , 
but i do n't know what to do to stop it . 
even we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting , 
they would think it did n't mean them , i guess . 
i guess not , 
everybody but me . 
do you live at home with your parents ? 
so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family . 
mostly . 
what can you do to stop that ? 
i do n't know . 
i am used to it now , 
but sometimes it sort of gets to me 
but there is not much i can really do . 
just have to live with it , i guess . 
i do n't know . 
do you have brothers ? 
i do , 
but they do n't live at home . 
i had two younger brothers , 
and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations 
i used to do that though because i was the youngest , 
i would pick up the phone and listen to theirs . 
i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they could n't hear me , 
and then they would go get on the other extension 
and i could hear them , 
but i could n't get them to hang up . 
but i stopped doing that a long time ago , 
and they still do it to me . 
and when you 're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy , they 'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up . 
this lady does that to me at work when i 'm taking an order or something , 
and she 'll just sit there and listen like i 'm doing something wrong , 
and she just started 
and , she is nice 
but it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do . 
let 's see , 
i ca n't think of anything else i 'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors . 
i do n't have that many people coming to my door . 
occasionally we 'll have a person here or there , but not as many as the phone calls , 
and i guess that 's really the thing that really bugs me the most . 
our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me , 
but they 've all gotten grown up now 
and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me , since mine are all grown up , 
especially when you 're in a hurry . 
do you have a lot of traffic in your area ? 
it can get busy , 
some days it 's real , real bad here , 
and you would like to , feel like it 's an invasion of privacy because you ca n't even ride down the road without people all the way around you . 
i 've traveled quiet a bit , 
it 's pretty busy . 
it really is , 
it really is . 
i live right on a main thoroughfare , 
so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy 
because at first you 'd hear a lot of noise , especially at night when you go to bed . 
and every time a fire truck or anything went down the road , i would wake up , 
but i guess i have gotten used to it because i do n't even hear it anymore . 
i suppose you do . 
and i just close it out , i guess , 
i think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me . 
i am a real solid sleeper though 
so that probably would n't bother me . 
i 'd sleep right through it . 
they would have to chop down the door and get you out , i guess . . 
it takes a lot . 
let 's see . 
what else is an invasion ? 
i was mad because those were mine , 
did you have has name all over them ? 
it was a letter from a girlfriend of mine . 
i was upset because those were mine , 
i thought he would respect me more than that , to look through my things and not trust me , 
i was mad about that and my privacy there . 
have you seen a new movie lately ? 
i am a student 
and i have been actually watching more movies on video , than being able to go out to see movies at the theater . 
i have n't seen either one of those . 
what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though ? 
let 's see . 
i 'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on . 
white palace which i thought was over hyped , recently . 
you 're catching me at mind 's end here . 
what have you seen recently ? . 
what did you think of that one ? 
enjoyed that quite a bit . 
though it tended to be a little one sided it was good . 
and that 's when the movie was filmed , 
and when the movie came out , we went , 
and , my dad has got a little plane , 
it was really neat . 
or they 'd start recognizing people . 
i think i enjoyed it more when i watched it on video cassette than i did in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they 'd say that . 
i 'd go which one could that be , 
scope . 
but i thought it was a good film . 
but you are right , 
i think it was very one sided . 
it was , 
in fact , i was watching wild wild west last night 
but it was an interesting movie . 
have you seen pretty woman ? 
i thought that was a good show . 
that was a good movie . 
it was just kind of a get away movie . 
kind of , 
it did n't have any real social bearing 
and it was n't really a comedy , 
but it was an enjoyable movie . 
i do n't know , 
i sure did have a mind lock about the movies i 've seen . 
but 
are you going to see this next one that 's coming out ? 
have you seen the rest ? 
i think i 've missed one . 
i 'm not sure , 
but i think i 've missed one . 
and they showed all five in a row . 
they had it everywhere , 
every major city had one theater that did it 
they did it everywhere . 
and it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed , 
but you can watch the characters develop , 
i guess it 's a subject i have n't thought too much about . 
i do n't know if there 's so much wrong with the public schools as much as , we 're expecting too much out of them . 
that might be a lot to do with it . 
i 'm not sure where you 're from . 
problems with our educational system , a lot of it 's due to money . 
and they 're trying to spend money where we do n't have it 
and there 's a lot of things we need that we just ca n't afford . 
it is getting very expensive to run schools , 
it is . 
they 've got computers now that you got to train on . 
there 's just so much more and less money to do it with . 
that 's true . 
and a lot of it has to do with salaries too , speaking of money . 
cause if you ca n't pay the right people they 're not going to get the people that can do a good job . 
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools , i think they 're expecting schools to discipline the kids 
and i think it should go right back to the parents . 
i feel the same way . 
a lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home . 
and then when the kids get to school , they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids . 
they 've so severely limited what disciplinary action you can do . 
they do that now and they could probably lose their job . 
lose their job and big lawsuit and all that . 
i feel that 's got a lot to do with it . 
it seems that 'd be a subject that i do n't have much to say on . 
our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education 
but he was n't . 
and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly . 
if you have more money it 's just logical that you can provide a better school system . 
and , unfortunately , there 's not many places to get that money . 
i know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this . 
that most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level are n't scientists , 
they 're teachers . 
and they may not know a lot about what they 're teaching . 
where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses 
and they 're trying to teach social studies . 
and they do n't know a lot about that . 
my professor was a physics professor 
and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level . 
so therefore , they 're teaching from a teacher 's point of view and not from a physicist point of view . 
and that causes a lot of trouble . 
i do n't know , 
maybe they should sit back and kind of decide on where the money 's best spent . 
i know in a lot of cases different districts like to have nice fancy schools . 
and maybe they should be a little more concerned with paying the right people to teach and be satisfied with maybe a little older school . 
because here in the town i went to high school , 
one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado . 
and so it kind of would make you think that we 'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them . 
i know where i came from . we did n't have a very rich community 
and high school that i went to was very old 
and as far as i know , it 's still there . 
they 've expanded on it 
but they 've never built a new one 
and i do n't foresee them building a new one for a long time because they ca n't afford it . 
i guess i 've always kind of liked golf . 
i worked on a golf course at one time 
and that 's how i picked up golf . 
and i do n't know 
it 's just kind of a challenging game . 
it sure is . 
i play at least three times a week . 
i 'm on it , 
i have n't gotten the chance lately though to play . 
i 'm trying to get back into it . 
so i got to start all over again . 
it 's not like riding a bicycle . 
you do tend to , forget . 
i 'm one of those rare left-handed golfers . 
and i do enjoy playing . 
what is your handicap ? 
right now it 's three . 
i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago . 
it 's probably up there to twenty now if i to start again . 
if you play with some consistency though , you can get it right back down . 
i have got to try and get out there . 
i know with our long winters i enjoy watching it . 
i do n't know if it 's just because i like the game or i just like to see the warm weather . 
we can usually play here year around . 
but there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play , 
and i 'm pretty much addicted to golf , 
so . i get out there one way or the other . 
it 's a good game though . 
it 's very challenging 
and the reason i like it so much is because i 'm essentially playing against myself . 
that 's the way i look at it . 
i play in a lot of groups 
but they keep score between themselves 
but i really do n't care . 
i go out 
and each shot i say , this is what i 'm going to try to do 
and then i see how close i can come to that . 
you always work on trying to improve each day 
either i 'm not driving very well 
or i 'm not hitting long irons very well 
or i 'm not putting well 
but sometimes it all comes together . 
i know what you mean . 
one of the two 
or something would go wrong 
but i always managed to get near par anyway . 
and i went to that . 
this is a big golf area . 
do you have long waits to get on the course ? 
we do as a matter of fact . 
it 's only been that way in the last five years . 
most of the courses have a two day advance tee time you have to call , 
i just moved into this small community 
so i 'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here . 
i , was from the twin cities area . 
that 's some cold golf too , is n't it ? 
are you sure you guys are n't having the bad weather ? 
we have cold . 
i wish that 's all we had . 
something is coming through now 
but it 's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties . 
but we do n't get any snow anymore . 
i do n't know what changed that pattern . 
we used to get four or five inches a year . 
now we get nothing . 
i see . 
at least that does n't get in the way of golfing 
but i have played golf in the snow before . 
get out my orange golf ball and go out . 
that 's what they do here sometimes . 
you hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there 
i guess i 've always been kind of interested in , space and stuff . 
have you been following the progress of the space health code ? 
to a degree . 
i have n't kept up as much as i would like , 
i 've just been so busy , 
i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then , 
and 
i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if it is at all possible . 
i would n't even mind being a pilot on one , 
or right now 
but i 'm probably getting a little too old for that . 
i know if they make the advances that they have been making , that maybe age or even physical abilities may not be a barrier anymore . 
i agree . 
and that little space program was one of the big backers of that . 
it 's amazing , 
it 's hard to imagine what life was like without it now . 
i 've seen him before . 
what would we do without it ? . 
we were talking about that just the other day . 
what did we do without it back then ? 
there 's a lot of little things that have come up . 
concentrated foods for one maybe 
i do n't know 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
i 've often pictured in my mind what would you find if you just kept on going ? 
that 's true . 
i always thought what do you do 
hit a brick wall , eventually . 
it 's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely . 
that is something that would be hard to think about . 
i agree . 
but 
i would like to see them do more in that area to make space travel more something that the ordinary person can enjoy . 
i think it 's in people 's nature to be the first to do something . 
me too . 
i would n't even mind not so much being first but just get out there and just explore . 
i think it 's in everyone 's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they have n't , or experience something indifferent . 
i think that 's what made us progress to the state we are is our curiosity . 
of course . 
that 's true . 
there must be some better way of doing this . 
a better place to be or whatever 
so you are always looking for something better . 
that 's true . 
i know at work people always complain to me 
i 'm always looking for something better . 
there 's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
and if you are just content with the way things are then you must lead a pretty dull life . 
they are always finding easier ways 
i guess you do n't really think about it too much . 
i guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff 
it 's a subconscious thing . 
somewhere they can sit down and write down what things that you 've improved upon , 
you probably would n't have a pretty good list . 
but you just do n't think about them . 
and that 's true . 
we 've gotten different programs at work to , make it visible to management that we are doing things better , 
i do n't know what to do about the federal budget . 
there certainly have been ideas surfaced recently matter of fact repeatedly by many people 
and i sort of wondered what thoughts you had on that area . 
the first one is we need people in there that understand numbers . the numbers that are being thrown around when we 're talking in trillions of dollars . which is an astronomical sum 
and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means . 
are you talking about the elected people 
or are you talking about others ? 
the elected people . 
our senate and congress and people that deal everyday and do n't really understand what that is or how a budget even works . 
how would you achieve that ? 
let 's make them have a degree in economics . 
so you would trust the decision making economists ? 
sometimes called the dismal science . 
but people that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar , 
the , lobbyists , needs them to be eliminated from congress . 
they do n't make pragmatic decisions . 
they make a decision based on constituency instead of a decision based on what they really believe . 
so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists . 
i definitely would . 
get rid of them . 
no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for ? 
i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that , and be registered with what they ever contribute . 
but they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them . 
that 's a conflict of interest as far as i 'm concerned . 
when you are talking again billions and trillions of dollars you 're jeopardizing the future of the country for today . 
that , 
so you talk about jeopardizing the future . 
would you be against any deficit spending ? 
i think to bring it in line you are going to have to have a generation that 's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line . 
you ca n't ease into it . 
it took years and years to build up the momentum that 's there now . 
i forget the figures on the interest rate 
but it 's something like hundreds of thousands of dollars a second in interest . 
part of the problem is we do n't loan from ourselves . 
we buy from intimate international banking . 
that 's why we have interest . 
and i really feel that is part of the problem that we 've let things get so out of control that we do n't want to put the brakes on them . 
but what practical steps could one take ? 
by having a budget that is reasonable . 
but everybody will say that he is for that . 
, and how will you , make that actually happen ? 
of course . 
and then add on to it . 
you take the gross national income 
and you say our budget is x number of percent of this gross national income . 
one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax . across-the-board , 
everyone no matter what , pays a ten percent income tax . 
sounds like a good idea . 
no , deductions , nothing . 
that 's right . 
no deductions . 
just ten percent . 
you pay a ten percent income tax . 
that 's what you pay 
and that 's it . 
so that 's it . 
i agree with that 
that 's a good idea 
and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or lower them or what ? 
i do n't know that it would or would n't . 
who 's your favorite team ? 
you bet . 
so i kind of grabbed on to that team , way back when . 
that 's pretty nice . 
that 's good . 
that 's right . 
how about your favorite team ? 
and they never score . 
they never blow out their opponents . 
they just score just enough points , 
and that really impressed me . 
and i 've been keeping up with the saints a lot . 
they are exciting , are n't they ? 
the saints are starting to impress me this year a lot . 
they are just a fun team to watch . 
i did n't . 
it was funny . 
they a fireworks display at halftime . 
and some paper or something in the super dome up in the roof caught on fire . 
so , they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter and put out this fire . 
those big piece of something came falling out of the roof and landed on the field 
so there 's this big fire on the field 
i ca n't believe that . 
you just really ca n't tell what 's going to happen . 
that 's hilarious . 
i know . 
it 's like about two weeks ago i was watching the saints . 
and it was beautiful , right down the middle . 
he is tough , 
he has an incredible leg . 
he is . 
do you think they 're going to be able to make it this year , past the first playoff game ? 
i sure hope so . 
i 'm not sure who they play . 
right now i 've got it narrowed down to the top four teams . 
who 's that ? 
and they beat the saints . 
their only time they lost . 
and if that was an off night i 'd hate to see when he 's on a good night . 
he definitely is one of the best i think . 
they really impress me . 
that 's right . 
who did they play ? 
that 's right , 
they won , in overtime . 
that 's right . 
i remember that now . 
i watched that game 
do you have a favorite between those two ? 
so , i 'll almost always root against them . 
that 's true . 
i hate to say it 
that 's okay . 
and they just kind of grew on me . 
i imagine . 
that 's the way , 
i 've never been a big saints fan until the last year or two 
and they 've actually started doing something . 
so , i 've actually paid attention to them . 
do you know anything about the expansion teams they 're thinking about bringing in ? 
to tell you the truth i have n't paid too much attention to that . 
what cities are they looking at ? 
and there 's some other city . 
but i 'm not sure . 
i think you are right . 
think so ? 
i think i remember hearing that . 
because i know they 've got a football team 
but i think it might be them . 
that would be fun . 
i 'd like to see some more teams get in . 
i would , definitely . 
i think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after . 
so what do you guys having up there ? 
that 's a long time . 
i was in the air force . 
so what 's it been like up there ? 
for the past week or two it 's been cold and wet 
but before that , for most of the year , it 's been hot and dry . 
it really has been strange here this year , 
course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one . 
but . always , they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever , 
and we had all this rain , 
and it really is not a bad summer at all , 
really cool . 
just pouring down . 
that kind of deal , 
if you had it early . 
but usually it 's not until later . 
it 's really strange . 
but we really need the rain that we 've been getting , 
and it has not today , 
but the last few days it 's been pouring most of the day . 
is it flooding anywhere ? 
flooding anywhere . 
i have not heard of any problems of it flooding anywhere , 
that 's occurred certainly at times in the past , 
but 
i 've not heard of any particular problems this time . 
we 're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here which will be a little bit more typical autumn weather . 
but really it 's strange . 
we have n't really had an autumn . 
it 's like we went into winter 
the poor trees , said what , 
we had summer lasting long 
then it became winter 
today it 's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day . 
and i was up there last weekend , 
and there are trees that still have their leaves on , 
and they 're green , 
but they 're dead . 
the freeze just got them . 
they were n't ready for it at all apparently , 
and we have n't had a typical fall at all . 
not much color changes have occurred at all . 
really weird this year . 
i 'm not sure what that means . 
i do n't know . 
our leaves are all on the ground now . 
i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors . 
so you all actually had some color ? 
it kind of crept in 
we did , for a time . 
it 's usually beautiful up there is n't it ? 
gorgeous . 
and looks just the same . 
it 's almost identical kind of country . 
beautiful . 
been that this year for the trees for the leaves . 
little oak tree that was dead , and cut it up and split it . 
that 's because it ca n't tolerate a freeze this early . 
is that right ? 
if it would came later it would be all right ? 
the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy . 
their leaves are still green , 
and there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves . 
they got bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit , 
but they still look pretty good . 
it just depends , on the tree . 
it 's not often you get many women interested in football . 
do you follow football very much ? 
i 'm sorry , 
what ? 
do you follow football very much ? 
i do n't , 
i have n't recently . 
we can talk about something else . 
you married ? 
i 'm not , 
i guess kids are out . 
what 's that ? 
kids are out . 
are you married ? 
i 'm married . 
got two boys . 
do you like football ? 
i follow the cowboys 
but that 's about it . 
the same here . 
been for a long time 
but i have n't been to any games recently . 
but i try to catch the game every weekend that i can . 
have you ever been to a cowboy 's game ? 
i have n't , 
it 's pretty nice . 
we decided just to watch them at home . 
that 's good . 
at least you follow the game a little bit . 
i 'm not a fanatic about it . 
i do n't know who played when and who does what like some guys are . 
i just like to watch , 
and hopefully they win . 
that 's about the extent of it . 
right now i 'm in college , 
so i 'm more into college football than professional , i think . 
i see . 
what school are you going to ? 
nursing . 
nursing . 
what are you planning to go into ? 
i have n't really picked a field . 
i 've thought a lot about labor and delivery 
but i do n't know . 
try that . 
that 's what my mom does , labor and delivery . 
she loves it . 
but she 's been working on a late shift . 
she works i guess the graveyard 's what you 'd call it . 
she works the graveyard shift . 
and she 's worked that for years , when i was small . 
i guess probably going on twenty years now . 
and she really enjoys it . 
she likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night 
and , she just started a new job at a different hospital , closer to where she lives 
and she 's really enjoying herself . 
she really likes it . 
that 's great . 
good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree . 
hope you 'll like it . 
but , my family 's there , 
i 'd like to go back . 
and they 've got large medical center down there . 
so that 'd be the place to do it . 
like i said , good luck to you . 
take care , 
and maybe we 'll meet up again some time . 
do you want to start 
or should i start ? 
go right ahead . 
i would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in . 
we have three children , 
and they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports , soccer and baseball 
and my little girl goes to tap dance , 
and my little one goes to preschool 
and i 'm home with the children , 
just do a lot of running around . 
it seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type life . 
what about you ? . 
i 'm single , 
and it 's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area 
we have a lot of town homes here as well as single family homes , 
and at the time that i bought this one it was just a much better arrangement for me personally . 
i 'm not home a lot . 
i travel a great deal with my job , 
so it was easier to have a home that somebody else looks out for the maintenance . 
was sort of maintenance free . 
i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends to maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds , 
and it 's a lot of work , owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it . 
it certainly is . 
sometimes i think it would be nice to have a town home , with not having all that responsibility . 
if you ever get one , be sure the walls are good and thick because if they 're not you can hear . 
that 's the main thing when i was shopping for one , 
i wanted to make sure i could n't hear my neighbors 
once you 're inside , you do n't know you 're in a town home . 
that sounds lovely . 
it is . 
so you do n't actually hear anybody next door to you . 
so in your area then there 's probably a lot of career type people that have those type homes 
definitely . 
and the area that we 're settled in is definitely young families with kids . 
they 're still doing a lot of building in the neighborhood . 
so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country , which we 're from the northeast , 
and seems like a people just do n't , or also do n't have any family around . 
so it also gives you a common bond when you do n't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors , 
there 
how pretty . 
it is nice . 
i do miss that . 
and it 's pretty flat and kind of barren 
we definitely have a lot of trees here . 
a lot of leaves to rake up too . 
that 's another plus . 
i do n't have to worry about that 
and this is the time of year we 're starting to lose , 
they 're all falling now . 
that 's right , 
that 's right , 
they are . 
i 'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done . 
we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but , not much . 
just a little 
kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks 
and if you did n't do anything about it , then they 'd probably the leaves just blow away . 
it 's not too bad . 
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time ? 
i do n't think so . 
it was really nice speaking to you . 
it was good to speak with you too . 
thank you , 
you too . 
i guess social change takes in a big category , 
i know that or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has greatly changed . 
i agree . 
it was on a talk show , 
they took the parents and then the son , 
and they compared income at different points in time when the father was a little bit younger and more in his heyday 
and they compared to the son 's , that he was making now . 
and even though the son was probably more successful higher up in the management ladder he was actually making less money when you go by costs of living . 
and it 's depending on where you live , though , too . 
i think i was living better ten years ago than i am now , even though i 'm making more money now , 
but my dollar went a lot farther . 
that 's true . 
. i remember though buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now . 
and he could see a movie for a nickel and things like that . 
and now it 's over a buck . 
i do n't know what it 's by you . 
. 
this is only my second phone call 
so i 'm waiting for mine . 
i suppose this will be towards my last one pretty soon , 
so they 'll stop me 
but i 'm pretty much out to the things to say . 
like social changes . 
and i do n't think this would have anything to do with it , 
but clothing and styles , lot of those changed . 
like i say , it 's a broad category , 
but even attitudes on clothing and stuff i know . 
towards each other . 
i know a lot of the things that men wear nowadays would have been considered feminine many years ago , 
but . i know , it was hard for me at first , 
but now i kind of like a lot of the bright colors . 
i used to be more conservative and just your basic colors , 
but styles come and go all the time , though . 
it 's just ridiculous , 
fads in and out . 
and even clothing from the sixties came back . 
i see a lot of girls wearing sixties clothes . 
one of the nice things , 
i do n't think that there 's anything as original , 
it 's all based on one of the past styles , 
they just make their circle and come back again . 
so if you hang onto your clothes long enough they 'll be back in style in a few years . 
that 's true , 
maybe some day 
i probably wo n't be alive to see it , 
but prices might go down lot more . 
i do n't know though , 
does n't look good . 
thinking back , i think the only style i hope does n't come back is bell bottoms . 
i remember that , 
i do . 
i did n't really care for them either . 
that is n't a true false or right or wrong test here . 
but unfortunately they 're not . 
my dad was , 
that 's all right . 
how do you expect them to do this year ? 
they did pretty well . 
what did you think of the world series ? 
i 'll tell you . 
it was kind of pathetic 
we only had two radio stations , 
and the other one was country . 
so you did n't really have a lot of choice , did you . 
so , that 's right . 
or country . 
but it certainly was an exciting series , anyway . 
it sure was , 
it sure was . 
what do you think ? 
i would like to assume that they 're going to do better this coming year , 
or can we predict ? 
i was sure hopeful anyway . 
when we moved down i was able to go to my first baseball game , and thought , this is great , 
this is incredible . 
or rather they adopted me , i guess 
and it was just exciting , 
and they hit the long ball , 
and it looks like they really hit that ball . 
but when you go to the ball park , it 's really not all that far , 
and it 's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you , 
is n't it though . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
i 'm a great sports enthusiast , 
so i love baseball teams , 
he was put in the restaurant hall of fame . 
and he says he 's coming back , 
he does n't know how many years to pitch . 
he 'll be at least one more , 
and he said he 's been saying one more , and it 's been two and three , might be two and three more . 
he likes it . 
that 's right 
and he 's still doing great still doing excellent . 
that 's right . 
and he said , i get a kick out of it 
he 's such a nice man . 
management . 
but he certainly is a good example for the kids . 
that 's right . 
you like to have someone like that you could point to say , see what a fine man , , he is . 
that 's right . 
and now their sons are . 
he 's been a legend for so many years , 
and i do n't know , 
i was n't . 
i think it was a little early part of the summer , 
that is neat . 
a game is a game . 
what do you think is the worst culprit for air pollution ? 
i think it 's probably a combination of things . 
those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain , 
and i think that 's probably hurting us a little bit . 
hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit , 
but i know we have n't cured it yet by a long shot . 
but it 's really bad on the environment . 
i guess i missed that one . 
automobiles of course are contributing , too , 
and , you know , how we are with our love affair with the auto 
kind of hard to do anything about that , i guess . 
i know , 
i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right , 
but they had a new policy where in order to get your car license , renewed , you had to meet the pollution standards 
we have that here , too , 
but it 's part of the inspection sticker , 
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe 
and so that 's the way they 're dealing with it here . 
i guess that was just mainly in the cities there , 
and as far as where i live , i do n't have to do that , 
and there 's no way i would put in a lot of money to repair it to meet standards . 
it 'd probably be difficult anyway . 
i was just reading an article in mother earth news magazine 
a lot of places are burning wood 
a lot of people are burning wood , 
i 've got a place in the country 
but they 've had up those for quite a while , 
it 's a catalytic converter , 
it 's a plate that fits into the smoke pipe 
and apparently it sort of feeds itself . 
after you get to like five hundred degrees , the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is . 
and it sounds real neat . 
i have n't seen them priced anywhere yet , 
that might help a little bit , especially in some places . 
we 're really lucky here . 
it depends , 
it comes back . 
i really think we 're doing some important things . 
education , raising consciousness awareness , 
i work for the school district here , 
and this is one of the big things with kids . 
kids are writing letters to the newspapers telling adults to clean up their act 
i hope we 're not too late with it . 
we 're having all kinds of recycling . 
that 's a big thing , too . 
i know it has nothing to do with air pollution , 
so i thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence . 
so you went to what college ? 
and what did you graduate in ? 
in what major or what year ? 
major . 
international business . 
and you ? 
and i 'm going into nursing 
that sounds interesting . 
how long of a program is that ? 
forever . 
seems like . 
it 's about five years , 
but it 's probably going to take me longer , because i did n't decide to major in that until about a year and a half after i was already in school , 
i read a study once , 
it took me five years . 
so , you get started 
and you change your mind , 
or you want to pick up a second major , 
if you 're management , you , thought , i 'll take that marketing , 
it only was three more classes , 
and just does n't happen that you get out in four years . 
what is your advice to picking a college . 
my advice is , look at the student to faculty ratio , 
that 's great . 
it 's interesting , 
what i thought was nice is there was always time to talk to professor , 
and they knew you . 
you were n't just in their class , 
and so you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time , 
or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . 
they 're always willing to help you out . 
in high school ? 
it was a biology lecture class 
and it just was n't the same . 
you 're sitting there , 
and you 're taking notes 
and , it just was n't the same . 
you 'd pass the teacher in high school 
and , even in high school you could say high to your teachers , unless you 're in that biology class , 
and they 'd look at you like , do i know you ? 
or should i know you ? 
the classes here are pretty big , 
so , it 's hard to get individual help . 
it 's kind of , you 're on your own . 
very little , 
for example , i 'm in a chemistry class right now 
and there 's tons of students in it , 
and he only has certain office hours , 
and so there 's only certain times you can talk to him , 
and you could get there 
and you still did n't get to talk to him anyway . 
what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college ? 
i think your advice is good . 
let 's see . 
my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college 
that 's excellent advice . 
because i did n't , 
and i took tons of classes that i did n't need to , 
and i do n't know , 
and not that 's always bad , 
i do n't know , 
it 's frustrating , i guess . 
it does get it . 
you get to the point where i 'm never going to get done . 
i was taking summer classes 
and let me get out of here . 
but 
that 's good advice . 
even if you do n't have your major decided on , have an idea what you think you might want , 
you do n't want management , 
but you think you want business , 
how many credit cards do you have ? 
i think i 'm down to one . 
i wish i was that way . 
is that why you said i had more experience than you ? 
i was pulling your leg . 
how do you use your credit card ? 
do you just keep it in reserve , 
the way i 'd like to try and use it is you make your purchases at prime buying time 
and then you pay that off and do n't use it until it 's paid off . 
that 's my ideal way . 
how do you use it ? . 
emergencies come along , 
and i use it . 
that 's understandable , 
my car had a major problem , 
seven hundred dollars , 
and things just come up 
and you just never get to use it the way you 'd really like to . 
actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have . 
and i use them , 
and i pay that off monthly , 
and then some other credit cards , like store credit cards i do have them up there a little bit , 
i try not to use them too often . 
it 's a very expensive area . 
so , sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something . 
i know i was up in there , 
and i was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble 
so we just disposed of them , paid them off , and got out of it . 
that was good that you had the opportunity to do that . 
are you married , that you both , you and your wife use a credit card , 
we pretty much just pay cash for as much as we can there . 
and i have that for automotive purposes . 
that 's great . 
everyone i know here uses credit cards like they 're going out of business to be honest with you . 
it 's just too easy , basically just get yourself in trouble with those . 
i see . 
so that i use , because i travel some . 
so i use that , 
and i do n't really have to worry about that , because i only use it for business , 
so i automatically have the money to pay it off . 
you start out at a low limit , 
and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit 
and if i can get one that 'll keep my limit at five hundred and i can never go over that or something like that , then that 's fine , 
forget it , 
i do n't want that . 
the temptation 's too great . 
so , i do n't know , 
just writing checks is just as easy i guess . 
that 's true , 
that 's true , 
so , i guess we 've kind of exhausted this topic . 
you ca n't say too much about it really . 
other than , you use them or you do n't use them . you like them or you do n't like them . 
i guess they do n't care if we end it early . 
that 's coming up , 
and , then , maybe we 'll talk again . 
you , too . 
then . 
. 
what kind of car would you like to buy next ? 
i guess that 's kind of everybody 's dream . 
why would that be ? 
i guess it 's a general motors product , 
and i like general motors because they 're made in the united states , 
and we 've had general motors for years and have always had real good luck with them . 
that 's good . 
if you had no financial requirements , if you could buy any car in the entire world , no matter what it cost , what would you buy ? 
do you ? 
i do n't know . 
that 's a sharp looking car . 
that really is . 
it always has been though , 
they have been . 
it never really has . 
it 's always had it 's own unique look . 
i 've always liked that . 
i thought , that looks sharp 
that looks real sharp . 
i think they 're very pretty . 
and course a vinyl top , i think those are pretty . 
but they 're supposed to be just real smooth . 
just a nice comfortable ride . 
they are , 
they look like they 're sturdy , 
they look like they 're very sturdy , 
and you do n't have to worry that much about getting hurt like you would in a small one . 
now they 've got a unique feature in them now . 
if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed , the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it does n't go into the inside . 
it 'll go underneath the car instead . 
i did n't know that . 
so that 's a big safety factor they 've got in them now . 
and i suppose they all have the balloons . 
the air bags , 
the air bags , 
that 's great , 
that 's great , 
you say you 've always have preferred general motors products . 
i do . 
i go for things built in the united states rather than foreign countries . 
help our economy 
what kind of general motors cars have you had in the past ? 
those are real nice riding cars too . 
that 's what we have now , 
we 've driven them for about probably twenty years . 
let 's see , 
i do n't know . 
but it 's a very good car . 
it 's not had one minute 's problem with it , 
that 's great 
that 's great . 
you just do n't want any hassles with it . 
you expect it to do its job , 
and i think a lot of car manufacturers do n't take that into consideration . 
that 's true . 
they just expect you to buy their product , 
but that 's been a key factor in me , is how reliable is this car going to be . 
price is an issue , 
but it 's not the most important issue . 
it really is n't , because now you can get five year financing on them 
but i would go with the general motors any time . 
but that 's all right . 
so everybody has a truck 
i 've just never had problems with them . 
i honestly think i would die before my truck would , keel over on me . 
those are good products also . 
let 's see , 
i guess my initial view is our tax burden has n't gone down in recent years , our total tax burden , despite tax cuts 
but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in the world , 
of the matter , 
you get what you pay for , 
if we 're going to have national health insurance , which seems likely , it 's necessarily going to involve more taxes . 
i take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the economy , that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes energy taxes , particularly , and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes , that 's the direction we should look . 
i guess i kind of have mixed feelings . 
you always sit there 
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it , 
and you wonder where 's it all going 
where 's it all going ? 
and we have such a huge national deficit , 
and i guess a lot of times there 's questions wondering if it 's doing a whole lot of good . 
i know there 's a lot of social programs out there that need help . 
but you kind of always wonder , where 's the money going ? . 
one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into a big trust fund , 
but that is a particularly regressive tax , 
it 's a tax on the first dollar earnings , 
i 'm sorry , 
i agree with that . 
i know 
and i know that the tax there is extremely high , much higher than we pay here , 
and other major countries are higher . 
and , as a whole , most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services , 
they 're real trade-offs there . 
and you sit there and wonder , 
i guess this does n't really have to do with taxes but just money in general , and , wondering if you 're going to have enough when you retire to live on . 
that 's a scary thing that there 's no real knowing about . 
there 's a lot of inflation risk that is n't taken care of in most private pension plans . 
that 's true . 
but are you involved with the legislature up there , 
and you picked this topic , 
i was just kind of curious . 
i did n't pick it 
you did n't . 
i do n't really recall . 
i may have filled out on the form , 
did you . 
i have n't placed any calls . 
did they automatically assign the topic ? 
when you place a call topic is given to you . 
i did n't know that . 
i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic , because i have n't made any calls yet . 
i 've just received some . 
you should try it . 
i did n't realize that . 
because it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you 're talking to . 
many of the subjects are . taxes especially . 
one thing that has kept our tax burden high is the level of the defense budget 
would you like me to go first ? 
and then my little one , three year old , is in a university of gymnastics , 
it 's a preschool 
and i think it was really hard to pick the right day care or preschool or mother 's day out . 
i guess you can classify them all together . 
and just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff . 
we do n't have any children , 
but we 're going to have one next year . 
so that 's something that i 'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future . 
i 'm working part time now , 
and i do n't know if i 'll be doing that or what we 're going to do . 
or staying home . 
but if we do , then i 'm going to need to find somebody , 
and our church has a mother 's day out program which they started last year , 
and we know a lot of people at the church 
so i would feel very confident with leaving my child there . 
that 's a very good place to start i think . 
the mother 's day out programs , 
and the churches always have a pretty good program , 
and you have to make sure that you apply pretty early , because a lot of places have very long waiting lists . 
and another question to ask is if they 're state certified if the teachers have their master 's degree in child education and child development . 
what kind of a structure is it going to be . 
time . 
and if they fall asleep , they kind of let them sleep , 
and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones , 
and the other ones get up and go do something else . 
it 's kind of scary because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately , 
that 's true . 
and so , i guess it 's such a growing concern , 
but then there 's a lot of good things you do n't hear . 
and sometimes when the child 's a lot younger before three years old , the church is a good program 
and sometimes you even consider having a private person come to your own home when they 're real little or something like that , 
and another consideration is what 's the ratio of teachers to children 
to children . 
because that makes , a difference , 
just your child , 
you would want , maybe , your child to have their own sheets all the time , and not have another child use that bed . 
i 'm sure that whatever you decide , you 'll be happy with . 
and it 's exciting time to have a new one . 
we 're pretty excited . 
i bet . 
that 's wonderful . 
but we have been thinking about that , 
but it 's a little ways off in the future 
but i figure i 'd probably start asking around at church because i know they have a limit as to how old they can be before you can bring them in . 
asking . 
some places take them as infants like eight weeks , even . 
there 's a place to look into , 
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants and then only up to two years old 
some places just specialize in just real little ones 
and then other ones are the older children . 
but it is a difficult situation , i think . 
i find exercise kind of a task , i guess i 'd say . 
i go to aerobics two days a week , 
but i also have three kids at home 
so they keep me pretty busy . 
that keeps you . 
that gives me plenty of exercise , 
but i enjoy walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family . 
excuse me . 
that 's fine . 
and yourself . 
i walked and run almost every morning . 
i 've sort of stopped here with the weather change , 
but it 's about a thirty minute exercise every morning . 
every morning . 
that 's fantastic exercise . 
he does it every day like a ritual . 
once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if someone invites him to lunch , he 'll not go , 
but he goes every day , 
and then he 's a runner , too . 
he runs three mornings a week 
he gets up about five and does his deal , 
and some days he does n't , 
but then maybe he 'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run . 
i 'd rather get a bicycle , 
but i had an exercise bike in the house , but did n't seem to use it enough , 
so somebody sold it in a garage sale , 
but i 'd like to get a bike and just do biking outside . 
the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here , 
and i know my husband and i both do it to just keep the pounds off . 
we 're getting up in age in our late thirties 
it keeps going , 
and it just gets worse . 
you still want to eat , 
i know . 
i think you feel better , too , if you get on some program like that , 
i go to this aerobics class two mornings a week , 
and i take my three year old with me . 
there 's a nursery there . 
and it 's kind of another day out for her to have little friends , 
but there are some parts during that exercise that i think , i can not do another second of this . 
i know some of it is so tough 
it is . 
and especially when somebody 's planning lunch for you and they know what 's good for you , 
we take the easy way sometimes . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
thank you for calling . 
thank you for participating . 
thank you . 
what kind of car are you thinking of buying next ? 
and i hate it . 
do you really ? 
what year is it ? 
i 've had one problem with it after the other . 
and there 's no reason for it 
fix or repair daily or find them road dead . 
there you go . 
my electrical system shorted out like two or three times , 
it would have been two thousand . 
she likes those . 
those are nice cars . 
what things do you consider when you buy a car ? 
the gas mileage for one thing , 
and i 've always had stick shift . 
the next car i get i want it to be automatic . 
i see . 
i hate driving anyway , 
especially when you 're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time . 
and when you work nine to five , or eight to five , and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately . 
that makes it very frustrating . 
everybody i 've talked to that owns one , has been real pleased with it , 
and i like the driver 's air bag , 
i like that . 
they really look sporty . 
i like that too , 
but i could n't afford the insurance on one of those . 
and we found a real good interest rate , 
when they 're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that , they really come down on their prices 
and we looked around at used cars , 
and we really could n't afford the payments on a used car , 
and we ended up with a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car , and the payments . 
that 's what i 'm paying on mine now . 
they said it had to be a first time buyer 's car or whatever , 
and they 're charging me unreasonable interest , 
but i 've got eight more payments 
and it 's paid for . 
that 's great . 
it 's a good car 
i 
when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door . 
so in addition to everything else we got off the car , all we had to do is show them our papers on our first car , 
and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it . 
so we got a four door this time , 
and i sort of went more for the comfort factor , 
and i liked the smaller cars , 
but i 'm a bigger person , 
and i really like comfort driving along the road and stuff . 
that 's another big factor of mine . 
next car i get 's going to be a four door too . something with some room . 
and you buy groceries and stuff like that . 
push my number . 
or are you a spectator ? 
i play golf 
but i do n't actually play golf . 
i 'm the same way . 
i go out there and hit the ball . 
hack it all over the place ? 
we 've got tons up here 
but i do n't know . 
how do you feel about your game ? 
i guess that 's a good question ? 
a friend of mine goes golfing a lot 
and he drags me out every now and then 
and i do n't really even have a game . 
i like that too . 
i do n't know 
i try to play , 
but a couple years ago i played two , three times a week and got lousy . 
i guess that 's the best i ever got was lousy . 
and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come 
and then i got worse again 
i 'm pretty bad 
but i get great distance hitting it across the ground , 
but i 'm getting better . 
i 've got where now i can hit it in the air some of the time . 
that 's pretty good . 
so i 'm kind of a novice at it . 
i 'm that and worse . 
actually i take it kind of seriously 
but i 've been doing so bad . 
next year i 'm starting over from scratch . 
i 'm going to go take lessons and everything . 
i 'm going to do it right , and see if i can actually play this game or not . 
i guess that 's what i need to do is get some kind of lessons or something . 
because my tee off is not bad , 
i 'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that 
it 's just , that initial tee . 
what do you do when you 're putting ? 
that 's a good thing . 
that 's something i could learn actually . 
that 's when i do my worst . 
i finally get to the green 
and i think i 'm doing all fine 
checking the ground and so forth . 
see how it 's going to break or whatever . 
can you really see it though ? 
what about the speed ? 
if you get down on the ground you really can . 
but can you tell how fast you 're going to hit it ? 
you know if it 's up on a slope that you 've got to hit it not kill it 
because when it 's going up a hill it 's going to break in a direction . 
but you can feel that ? 
i do n't know 
i can get it within four or five feet or something 
but i do n't have enough field . 
they make you die at the hole every time . 
it just dies and rolls in . 
i do n't know , 
it 's hard for me . 
it 's like i said 
once i get up on the green i 'm fine , 
so it takes me awhile to get to the hole 
once you 're there , you 're all set though . 
i 'm all set . 
we should play team golf then . 
i 'll get us there 
and you put it in . 
that sounds good to me . 
it takes them two to get there and two to get it in 
and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in . 
it usually takes me about probably two or three to get it there 
and then , that 's according to the hole 
it 's , according to where i 'm at on the green . 
that 's good . 
but the friends i play with they play all the time 
and they 're really good . 
so i guess they 're pretty good . 
that 's pretty good . 
that 's pretty good . 
i 'm talking to the wrong guy . 
that 's not my golf . 
that 's my friends . 
so i 'm not good . 
i 'm usually around a hundred . 
that 's my thing . around a hundred . 
i can hit a great drives and think i 'm going to do all awesome on this hole 
but it ai n't going to happen . 
and i alternate . 
it 's a good thing with me i slice it every single time . 
that 's good . 
i 'm sorry . 
all , sorts of hours calling and telling me that i want investment advise and i want this service and that service or the other thing . 
i hate those canned messages they put on my recorder . 
my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen 
just what went into the 
i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not . 
but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using 
and , businesses would be prohibited from calling for business selling you things . 
i 'm sure that 's true . 
some of did too . 
i think government can do that now , 
is that right ? 
and especially with possibly children around . 
that could be useful protection . 
and i do n't have children around 
but i just do n't like those nine hundred numbers . 
so , i 've excluded those . 
but it does not stop you from the dialing services . 
what are dialing services ? 
where they intend to sell you things . 
where people just call you . 
and then those problems has been eliminated 
those problems used to be when i used a credit card they 'd want to have my phone number . 
and i did not like giving it out . 
i gave out my work number 
otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number . 
if you go in and buy anything they want your phone number . 
and i do n't think they 're going to call me and ask me how it 's functioning , 
and i do n't give that out . 
i have an unlisted number 
so i do n't , 
that 's one solution 
but you nonetheless often get people calling you ? 
despite the fact that your number is unlisted ? 
and you actually have your number 
anything that you buy you may get put on a , preferred list that is purchased . 
and companies can purchase this list 
and what that is is people who buy from the mail . 
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers . 
is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number ? 
some of that unfortunately is legal . 
so they ca n't stop people from advertising 
and that 's what it falls under . 
it falls under the guise of advertising . 
so , i do n't care for it , 
but is it a legal solution for some companies . 
so that 's the way things are . 
i do n't know . 
i think it 's gotten much worse the last , few years . 
maybe that 's just because i 've gotten on more lists . 
the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy . 
you 've got the holy rollers 
and you 've got all kinds of people knocking on your door and , who want to either direct you to the right path or want to sell you paper routes whatever , 
so it 's not just the telephone . 
sell you magazines . 
surprised they get anybody this time of day 
but , i 've been trying all different times , 
but i do n't get anybody at five thirty , do n't get anybody at nine at night 
i 'm at , work 
and i just happened to walk back into my office . 
i 've been gone for a little while . 
i go to school 
so i 'm home certain days , 
and i really have n't been making any phone calls , have you ? 
i have n't ever made any . 
i just receive them . 
have you received many ? 
i have n't . 
the first time we were on this it came just about every day . 
i never had to make one . 
they just always came . 
people must be tired of it or something . 
i guess we 're supposed to discuss this subject , 
what do you think ? . 
i never gave it any thought myself . 
i was hoping you could tell me what you thought . 
i do n't have any objection to people doing that . 
i think it might be good for them . 
but as a mother of two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent . 
i 'm just concerned about their safety 
and if they were sent to a third world country i could n't help but wait worried . 
that would be my main objection . 
i do n't know 
i think maybe it should stay on a voluntary basis . 
it will probably never happen 
i think it would be good for everyone to do something like that 
but i guess i do n't feel like it should be something forced upon you . 
it probably wo n't . 
i do n't even know how we 'd pay for it anyway . 
we ca n't seem to pay for all the little things we have going now . 
that 's another consideration . 
but i do n't know 
some kids are so spoiled nowadays 
it might be a real eye opener . 
sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here 
and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes 
they 're just kind of shocked at that side of town . 
i probably lived in one of those when i was a little girl . 
that would be an eye opener , would n't it ? 
would n't it though ? 
it is . 
i know . 
sometimes i wish we 'd help them out instead of going all across the world , and helping some countries i never even heard of . 
i know it . 
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country . right on our borders . 
but , what do i know ? . 
but how did you get on this program ? 
i just went by that place . 
we were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost 
and we went by . 
that 's the first time i 'd seen it . 
it looked really nice . 
a lot of trees there . 
it looked like a sight . 
hang on a minute . 
i do n't think so , 
i 'm back . 
but how did you get on it ? 
but , he works over there 
we did it last time . 
so just my daughter and i are registered this time . 
i do n't know , 
they did n't even ask him back . 
that was weird , was n't it ? 
but like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time . 
i do n't get too many . 
and i can never find anybody . 
the first time i used to get calls from far away too . 
i 've had the same experiences , 
all right around here . 
i do n't know , 
there 's so many with this one town . 
even in some families some people talk a little bit different . 
my husband is from new jersey 
and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me 
and that 's one family ? . 
of course , i think everybody in new jersey sounds a little bit funny 
i agree . 
you know , how that goes . 
i 'm surprised she has n't told us to cut it off yet . 
so end your conversation . 
do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject ? . 
i sure do n't . 
you do n't have any kids you want to send over here ? . 
no kids . 
one of them is real idealistic , 
she might . 
i 'd be more suited to that than her 
she 's just bugs , 
i think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight . 
which is movies , 
correct ? 
that is correct . 
i do n't like going to see them in the theaters 
and i see most all of mine there . 
what have you seen recently that you enjoyed ? 
i do n't know , 
actually earlier tonight we were watching to live and die in l a . 
have you seen that movie ? 
i have n't . 
i live alone . 
it 's not too bad . 
we do . 
i have n't yet . 
i saw it this weekend 
and it is to me an outstanding movie . 
i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
he is an attorney 
and his daughter is an attorney 
and she has a suit against his company . 
it 's one of those things . 
it 's something that anyone can watch and enjoy . 
he 's a good actor though . 
he is . 
actually we saw her just the other night too . 
did you ? 
it 's one of our favorite movies . 
i live with a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us . 
we 've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months . 
that 's one i have watched six or eight times . 
i always feel so good when i get through with that movie . 
i like those movies that you watch time and time again . 
i do too . 
what business are you in ? 
i 'm an electrical engineer . 
is everything going all right up there ? 
it 's only about half an hour . 
i live on the border . 
that 's that bad then . 
that 's right . 
that makes a lot of sense . 
are you a native of that part of the country ? 
it seems , southern town , 
we live right in the corner . 
i live on that little ten mile spot . 
sounds wonderful . 
did you have damage this year with hurricanes ? 
not up where i live 
and we got the backlash of that thing . 
and they had record high waves , thirty year high waves come in there , 
and it was quite an experience 
what movies are you looking forward to seeing now ? 
so the doors movie , that 's out on video . i want to watch that . 
have you seen green card ? 
that would be pretty good . 
i have n't seen that one . 
that 's a real warm movie . 
it really just turned out nicely . 
so i would recommend that if you have a chance . 
i 'm in for it . 
we rent a lot of movies 
so we often sit around and say , what movies should we rent ? 
and we do n't know . 
if you can get green card , go for it . 
we 'll try that one . 
have you seen that one ? 
i did . 
and i do n't know 
i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see over at the medical school . 
you too . 
i 'm looking forward to it . 
the way , 
i 'll go ahead and start 
or i should n't say suit , but coat and tie every day . 
a year ago , i changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group . 
i guess it 's a different set of standards . 
so i dress almost the same every day . 
pretty much it 's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat . 
but , it was very different before . 
how do you dress ? 
so i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes 
and i have sweatshirt on today . 
and that 's pretty much the norm for me . 
if i come in in a dress , everybody 's shocked . 
i understand . 
they ask me what are you doing in a dress 
and it 's usually i have n't done my laundry lately . 
ran out of jeans . 
i understand , 
that 's funny . 
so , does it change ? 
your dress , 
do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that ? 
but , probably once a month or so , there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit . for a customer presentation or something . 
every now and then i 'll get dressed up and come in , 
but that 's for my husband 's job and not mine . 
i see , 
i understand . 
i have to go to a business meeting once a month with him , 
. that 's interesting . 
let 's see , 
what else about this 
and i guess you are . 
that we dress in the jeans 
and then there 's kind of the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing . 
but there 's not much , 
middle of the road . 
it 's nice that there 's not a requirement for it . 
sometimes i think there should be . 
i guess you see those once in a while . 
and they have the no shorts deal , 
but i guess that 's one of the things you got to put up with when you do n't have a dress code . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
i 'm not even sure what they are . 
but , i 've seen those , too , 
so this was n't necessarily a big conversation , 
but , i think we did it . 
i am , 
and i work in the north building . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
this is a real first . 
are you at work ? 
i am . 
i 've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening 
and i thought , i 'm not having any luck , 
i 'll try the middle of the afternoon . 
i 'm happy we got through . 
i am , too . 
do you have any opinion on the subject ? 
i 'm especially interested with what 's happening in the soviet union , 
democracy . 
we hear a little of the news . 
i have heard about that the last couple of days . 
do you know ? 
or a population or anything , 
i 'm really uninformed . 
i 'm afraid i do n't have the statistics in front of me . 
, it 's not a tiny area . 
but it 's more significant , in the sense of , it 's a great agricultural region . 
i see , 
i did n't really know that , 
they 're completely out now . 
i thought they were . 
it 's very important for the economics of the soviet union . 
so there were probably really . 
except they ca n't fight . 
they do n't , 
it 's done democratically , 
did n't i read that ? 
i do n't know , anymore . 
i wonder how they 're going to get through the winter . food wise or any wise , 
sounds to me like they 'll start rioting soon not that that would do any good , 
but i guess people do that when they 're desperate . 
that 's true , 
has n't happened here for a while , 
that 's true , 
and the war riots , of course . 
let 's just hope we do n't get to that point . 
i hear you have some problems . 
we do . 
we have lots and lots of layoffs here . lot of companies folding , lot of layoffs 
and it 's pretty scary . 
i do n't understand economics that well . 
i do n't know , 
i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we do n't 
and so i assume that that has a great effect . 
the poor got poorer , 
the statistics prove that 
or is it just coincidence it was during this period ? 
i really do n't know . 
i think maybe they contributed to it . 
of course , if somebody in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions i do n't know what 's going to happen then . 
that 's one of the ways they get away with it . 
and child labor . 
i do n't know . 
what do you think has caused our horrible situation ? 
i do n't think there 's any one simple answer to the whole thing . 
one thing . 
that 's very complicated . 
i 've read that is a theory . 
which one are we going to throw out ? 
i hate to say it , 
but , i 'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party . 
i know , 
it used to , 
and for a while i kind of deserted the party , 
but now it 's looking better to me . 
i like your governor . 
do you ? 
i 'm glad to hear that . 
she 's an impressive woman . 
i think so , too . 
and i really hope she does well . 
but she 's probably more popular out of the state than she is here , although she did manage to win . 
but look who she was running against . 
he shot himself in the foot so many times . 
i know some of the people . 
guess it 's logical to ask , do you exercise any ? 
unfortunately very little . 
much less than what i need to . 
i 'm about the same way , 
i do a little bit . 
my job kind of hinders me from exercising . 
i 'm a night operator here at a industry down here 
and i do n't really get out a lot , to exercise . 
i am an assistant teacher in business technology 
and i think the most exercise i 've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids ' questions . 
it keeps me pretty busy , 
but it 's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going . 
exercise is so important . 
it is . 
and i realize that . 
that 's the way i feel . 
i 'm used to being in pretty good shape because when i was in high school i stayed in pretty good shape , played a little basketball and stuff like that , 
now , i 'm in college 
and i go to school during the day and work at night . 
i can tell that i 've not really done a whole lot . 
when you exercise , what do you do ? 
do you do it at home or a club 
i usually play at home . 
we live out in the country 
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play 
or a lot of times we 're up at the church 
stuff like that . 
really ? 
what is it , 
and that 's not bad . 
that 's pretty upbeat , 
so every once in a while i 'll put the cassette in and go with it . 
not often enough to have a routine . 
but i do n't know , 
by the time i get home , all i want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer 
and my fingers exercise more than anything now . 
that 's the way i am . 
i just want to sit down and relax . 
too tired to exercise . 
i did . 
do you ever ride a bike or anything like that ? 
i started riding my bike about a couple of months ago 
and i 'd ride about two or three miles a day , 
but it would last about a couple of weeks 
and it got real cold for a little while 
so i gave it up . 
here , about the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk , 
walk around . 
because they 're enclosed 
and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter . 
i 've noticed people doing that down here , too . 
i 'll be in town or something 
and people will walk around the mall . 
and it 's safe . 
it is fairly safe . 
that 's inside the mall 
may be not safe going to the parking garage . 
certain parts of it . 
a friend of mine suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is . 
i used to do a lot of swimming , 
we have a swimming pool , 
but it 's an old concrete pool . 
we 've been having trouble with it the past few years , 
so we have n't got to use it much , 
but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that . 
and the water takes the resistance . 
and you do n't get the soreness . 
i 've done some water exercises , 
but our pool is not heated 
you ca n't do it year round . 
that 's the way ours is . 
you do n't when it 's twenty some odd degrees , go out to the swimming pool . 
it 's too cold . 
hot tubs are not too bad , 
those are nice . 
whereabouts is that ? 
that 's way down towards the south . 
not quite on the coast , 
but we 're about two hours from the coast . 
and you do have cold weather down there ? 
it started about yesterday , i believe . 
today was pretty , 
and there was no exercise . 
you ready ? 
is that it ? 
that 's it . 
what kind do you subscribe to 
or do you ? 
i did subscribe to people for a long time . 
i enjoy people . 
and now i , subscribe to ladies home journal . 
i take a computer magazine . and also better homes and gardens . 
are you interested in computers ? 
you have too many recipes first of all . 
that 's what i do n't like about ladies home journal magazines . 
too many recipes , too many can this marriage nonsense . 
i like to read articles about things that matter . 
of course , people magazine is not one of your more intellectual magazines , 
but it 's nice , light reading . 
if i want something intellectual , i usually read a book . 
that 's true . 
i like it when they have short stories . 
that 's true , 
they did . 
i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore . 
i do n't know if they 're around anymore . 
i think it is . 
surely , 
it 's an institution , 
surely it would have to be . 
i 'll tell you , 
it was publisher 's clearinghouse , 
they told me if i did n't subscribe they were going to take me off their list . 
mine , too . 
this was it , my last chance . 
my last chance to win ten million dollars , 
so i figured , look . 
for twelve dollars , 
i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that to entertainment . 
that 's it . 
and i was real disappointed with it . 
i do n't know , 
not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into . 
it 's little short articles more than anything else . 
and that 's one thing i do n't like about people . 
it does n't seem to have enough story to it . 
i do n't know , 
i just think it 's light reading . 
if you 've only got a short time to read . 
you do n't have to concentrate . 
that 's true . 
it 's entertaining , 
i enjoy it , 
is n't it similar to the tv guide ? 
not really . 
not the one i take now . 
it 's a magazine 
and it goes into all the movies , previewing the movies that are going to be released or behind the scenes . 
i see . 
so that 's why i thought i might be interested in it , 
but it just has n't been what i thought it would be . 
and the reason i get the home journal and the computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me . 
otherwise , if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf , i 'll pick it up then . rather than having them delivered and think , i really need to read this . 
i 'll tell you , 
since i 've been getting the journal maybe i 'll read two , maybe three , 
if i read three articles in , one of the journals , i figure i did really well . 
because there 's just nothing in there that interests me . 
i 'm not into recipes 
so that eliminates three quarters of the magazine . 
that 's true . 
i just got the new issue , 
so that should be one article that i 'll read anyway . 
that 's the only one i 've got now for this area . 
anyway , we 've got a easy subject . 
we do . 
you go ahead first , if you 'd like . 
let me think here . 
you get so busy . 
i used to . 
i have one favorite soap opera . i still watch and i tape because i 'm not home . 
and let 's see , 
that 's general hospital , 
i know . 
let 's see , 
are they little ? 
i have a seven year old and a ten year old . 
they 're pretty young . 
so we usually catch full house , 
and what 's the one comes on after that . 
it 's a new one , , 
i do n't know , 
my kids are older 
so i do n't know some of those shows now , like i used to . 
, i like the comedies . 
they 're just light , too . 
now that is a good one . 
i make a point of that . 
that is . 
i love that 
and i really like coach . 
i think when it 's good , it 's just a scream . 
he 's a good actor . 
he really is good . 
he 's probably playing himself . 
half the time you see these people on an interview show , they act just like they do in their parts . 
and he acted about the same . 
he could very well be . 
i watch more now because i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy 
but this semester i 'm only taking one course 
i just make a point of seeing those . 
i never see that . 
i 've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show . 
it 's fabulous . 
really , you should never miss that . 
they are just gems of shows 
really , fabulous in every way . 
nice . 
what night is that on now ? 
so . that 's my one night out and about , 
maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime . 
just so you get the idea . 
it would n't take much to get hooked on those . 
i watch those . 
are there any new ones this year that came out that you like 
we started watching northern exposure . 
it 's not really new , 
but it 's still kind of new . 
how 's that ? 
i have n't seen that . 
i like it a lot . 
it 's real different . 
in fact , they never thought it would be a hit . 
somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does 
or it sounds weird , 
but , it 's very unique show and very well done . 
excellent actors . 
i 'll have to watch for that . 
it came on after something we used to watch 
and i guess we just kept sitting there 
and now we make a point of watching . 
i ca n't take all these shows on because next semester i 'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television . 
then , it will be mostly reruns , i guess . 
we used to watch a lot of designing women , 
i 've seen that . 
was she the best one ? 
was she the best one on that old show ? 
she was just funny . 
she was really funny . 
and her character was good . 
i do n't know that it was her in particular but just the character . 
they had a big fight on that show , did n't they ? 
they were all accusing each other of everything in the world . 
that was awful 
and who knows still , what really happened , . 
i know , 
you never will , probably . 
i know . 
i do n't have cable . 
we do n't have that station either , 
so i have n't been able to catch any of that , 
but just what little we caught on the news . 
it 's just as wild as any soap opera , from what i hear on the news . 
i know it . 
i do n't see how he could n't be , . 
i know , 
what 's in it for her . 
that 's right . 
and they said this lawyer is unbelievable . 
but , they said she held up so well yesterday . 
i know , 
everybody was saying that 
and then the paper said it 
so , it should be interesting . 
i was reading that in the supermarket line . 
i never have the nerve to buy the thing . 
do you watch any sports or anything like that 
i do n't care anything about that . 
because i do n't either . 
i always watch that . 
i think it 's so beautiful . 
i like to catch the gymnastics sometimes , too . 
that 's good . 
go ahead . 
we 're going to compare notes . 
i often desire to exercise , often believe i should and rarely do . 
do n't do it . 
i tell you , i firmly believe in exercising . 
i do it every day on a regular basis . 
i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles , 
but this time of year , you ca n't get much biking in . 
but every morning i use this president 's council of physical fitness 
and it 's worth doing , 
and you can do it anywhere . 
i travel quite a bit in my business , 
and you can do it wherever you 're at 
i do it every morning usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get dressed to go to work . 
so , what i 'm telling you is n't something you go out and do 
and you 'll hurt yourself . 
prone type things , where you 're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing , 
what keeps you doing that . 
i sometimes start much more modest efforts , 
but i give up , 
i just find them boring . 
hard to find the time for it on a given day 
and to stay in condition , i did that just as a normal basis , 
i do three hundred sit ups a day now , but not in the morning , 
i do a hundred then 
and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed . 
and you can eat anything you want , drink anything you want , 
but you do n't , 
within reason you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being 
i think it 's really important . 
whenever i do it , i feel good that i have done , good because it seems right and good because it has good effects . 
but it 's this maintaining a regular habit that i just ca n't seem to do . 
i like biking 
or you do n't have time or something like that . 
and you get up a half hour earlier 
and once you start getting into that , one , you just feel good 
and you look a whole lot better . 
does your wife participate in any of this 
unfortunately not , 
and there 's no way i can get her to . 
it 's something you either just really want to do it or you ca n't talk anyone into it . 
if you do n't like to exercise it is n't going to happen . 
i sure wish she would . 
she 's unfortunately overweight , 
but she 's a wonderful woman 
and no sense getting in arguments with anybody , about it . 
i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me , little bit of peer pressure would help considerably . 
but you seemed to have solved that problem without any external help . 
no problem at all . 
you can do that . 
it 's that kind of half inch of foam or something . 
it 's a foam thing , 
and it 's just about six feet long , rolls up 
and i do n't take it on trips with me . 
you could , 
if i do sit ups , i 'll throw a towel down or something , 
so it 's right up your alley , then . 
i suppose so . 
let me push the button . 
i guess i 'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system , 
but i sense that it 's not going to happen anytime soon . 
i do n't think it 's going to happen either , 
but i wish it were 
and all we do is metric stuff . 
you 're now in what ? 
so everything 's metric 
and then you go to read some order book or something 
and it 's all confusing 
so i do n't understand as much , 
so i think we should get one adopted permanently . 
i guess that is the policy , 
but it 's been the policy for a long time 
and nothing ever happens . 
i suppose some things happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that 's happening , having a new generation come up that 's more used to it . 
a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to . 
they have to for international trade . 
but , i guess it 's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be because of computers coming into everything . 
i do n't think switching back and forth is that big a deal . 
i think people need to understand more what a meter is , instead of how many feet in a meter or something . just get used to using all the terms . 
no one knows what that is . 
everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind . 
i do n't see that , it can change it very quickly . 
we 're not the kind of society that something can be posed upon by government will . 
no one seems to be adopting it . 
metric system , no one wants it at all seems like . 
the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems money , dollar , coins , anything like that . 
and it obviously makes no sense that we 're practically alone in the world in using the old system . 
it 's pretty tough when you get everything confused , though . 
i think two systems is worse than one , though . 
because we do a lot of problems and things 
and you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems . 
i prefer metric , 
i think so . 
your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination . 
there are things you could do . 
but that has n't been adopted very widely . 
there 's this one sign 's kind of funny . 
it says metric signs next hundred miles . 
that would force everybody to use it . or to quit selling tape measures in inches . 
you suddenly have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now . 
where you are , do the schools emphasize the metric system ? 
in the engineering they all do pretty much . 
i meant down in the elementary schools . 
in the elementary schools . 
i do n't know . 
i would n't think so . 
i remember a ways back we did conversions , 
but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system . 
i think my children learned the metric system , 
but it does n't get emphasized over the other . 
they learn how many centimeters are in an inch 
and that 's about it . 
advice on son or daughter going to college . 
that 's advice that i will need in time future for my children , rather than one that i have personal experience with . 
i suppose i would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet those needs . 
let 's see , 
when i went away to school , i 'm trying to think . 
that was a strict requirement for me . 
again how serious a person is according to what they want to get out of school , 
i guess they 'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home , if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home . 
let 's see , 
what was the question , 
what 's the criteria for picking a college ? 
what advice would you give ? 
what advice . 
i guess one clear-cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus . 
stay in a dormitory if you can . 
go to classes , 
talk to faculty members and students . 
the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges , i think . 
the people are different 
you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you 're used to . 
i 'm thinking what problems my children might have in that , 
you think so ? 
but i agree with you . 
let 's see , 
what else . 
i 'd also advise them that if mom and dad paid for their college , that if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year , then they 'd have to get a loan to continue . 
course it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness , one , to work during the summer or part time . and two to take out loans to assume debt after college . 
that 's right . 
the responsibility of that . 
and they could work and earn money towards college . 
also if they stay within their state , you get a lot more financial aid 
or it 's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school , 
and also maybe then the parents could pay a third 
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is . 
so , it 's not too far away , 
mine is twelve . 
but it 's getting there , 
we still definitely can put away the money for college now . 
i would advise that they did not have a car at college . 
that 's my gut feeling , too . 
my son is certainly not persuaded of that . 
i 'm here . 
i did n't have a car in college . 
i think it 's more a burden to provide for . 
i think so , too . 
i think because most kids do n't have a car at college , the ones that do get taken advantage of 
and i think it 's just trouble waiting to happen . 
so i would advise they did n't take a car and , they did n't take a television 
and they did n't take a refrigerator . 
let me see , 
what have you seen lately ? 
five ? 
only five ? 
i thought i 'd better see that one before i go and see six . 
did n't need to . 
i found that out . 
how about yourself ? 
i just saw the latest one . 
how is it ? 
it was fantastic . 
i ca n't wait . 
the lines in there were just perfect . 
it 's just the old guys still . 
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time . 
however , the rumor is that it will happen next time 
that they said they were n't going to do anymore . 
that was it . 
except that the rumor is that they still might , 
but it may not include the entire crew 
and it will be a next generation meets this generation . 
i 'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the old guys was . 
i think it 's a hundred years . 
somewhere in that range . 
that 's right . 
is that right ? 
he was a doctor still ? 
he was rear admiral , whatever , 
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow . 
he did n't look too bad , did he ? 
imagine that . 
that 's amazing . 
but , did they have some pretty good special effects ? 
excellent , excellent special effects . 
but i think the script was just incredible compared to the last one . 
the script was bad , bad , bad . 
you know why ? 
i do n't . 
why ? 
is that right ? 
and even worse , he directed it . 
in fact he did n't direct this one . 
he produced this one . 
, journey home , i think that was . 
i think so . 
i really like them . 
did you get to talk to him ? 
it was crowded . 
not in a crowd like that . 
it was want an autograph , want to stand in line for about four hours . 
it was a pretty crowded place . 
they have some good management principals in this new generation . 
it 's kind of funny . 
i was reading in a book . 
trying to think , 
i ca n't quite remember the name of the book , 
every time he left the enterprise , everything went to hell . 
and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship . 
so he kind of was a cowboy type , too . 
made all the decisions 
it 's definitely a lot better . a lot more realistic really . 
what other movies have you seen ? 
how was that ? 
it was pretty good . 
there were a few things different than the old series , 
but on the whole , it was pretty similar . and , a lot of fun . 
lots of little funny spots . 
did they have thing 
in fact , thing has a much bigger role than he does in the series . 
there is lots of areas where thing saves the day . 
and he runs around a lot . 
i 've always wondered how he gets around . 
just finger hopping . 
but he 's in a box ? 
in fact , it 's funny . 
he never does come in out of a box . 
he was just kind of walking around . 
did n't he used to ? 
not really . 
he was always in the box before . 
that 's , okay . 
that 's what i was thinking . 
what do you feel are some of the main problems ? 
i 'm in an urban area . 
and we 're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem even a more major problem . 
drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now . 
there is a lot of theft , a lot of assault dealing with people trying to get money for drugs . 
and i think that 's a national problem , though . 
it 's pretty bad here , too . 
it 's not unique , 
and i 'm sure you have a lot of students there and a lot of researchers 
so you may have perhaps a little better economic climate , 
i 'm sure there is problems with it , 
and over half of it has been drug related . 
i do n't know . 
a number every week . 
seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or , like i say , drug related . 
i guess the other thing that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values . 
seems like a lot of people do n't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to . 
and the economy is so bad 
and so many people have been laid off and stuff . 
the economy is lousy . 
they 've done special stories on the local news here . 
it 's a pretty nice neighborhood 
and this lady was going to work , 
she came home 
and everything in her house was total gone , light fixtures , everything . 
and nobody thought any different , 
they just thought she was moving . 
it was a moving man pulled right up to her house , broke in and stole everything she owned . 
that really takes someone who is bold to do that . 
it 's pretty bad . 
do you find that security is very good in a town home ? 
i would say so for the majority in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home 
and we all know one another 
and , on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we 're not moving and different things like that . 
i 'm probably one of the youngest people that live over here . 
i see . 
most people are , retired 
and i 'm in my twenties , 
so i 'm out more than they are , 
but they 're at home at night , 
so i really do n't worry about anything . 
i think you hit on one point there is you know each other . 
i 'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything . 
i guess you would say the neighborhood road , it runs between the high school and the commercial districts 
it 's in a nice neighborhood . 
the houses here before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so 
and , course , everything 's down ten to twenty percent now . 
that 's the same thing here . 
one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away 
and now the economy is bad , 
they have trouble keeping those full 
they 're not nearly as selective as they used to be . 
and , course , that 's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex . 
you start letting that happen 
and they go down 
and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things 
so i 'm sure that aggravates it also . 
how is the weather out there ? 
it 's really cold 
and they 've gotten more snow than they 've ever had . 
how about you guys ? 
. it 's about same . 
the usual , i think . 
nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff . 
it 's good . 
the weather , let 's see , 
what part ? 
and the snow is really cold . 
it 's really humid 
or there ? 
and it seems like when the winds blow , it goes right through you . 
because when it 's cold , it 's really cold . 
i do n't think there is any mountains to stop the wind . 
what 's that ? 
i do n't think there is any mountains to stop the wind . 
i think that 's true . 
because i noticed when i got here , too , 
and we 'd have to get really warm , 
and you do n't feel super cold . 
that 's true . 
it was weird . 
so how long ago did you graduate ? 
or did you , 
and so he just graduated this past year . 
so you just barely moved away ? 
do you like it out there ? 
we miss the mountains . 
you do ? 
because it 's really flat here . 
but no big mountains or anything . 
so you just moved away a year ago ? 
in august . 
really recent . 
but what else can i say about the weather . 
today was warmer . 
warm . 
so , what 's the temperature today over there ? 
maybe not that warm . 
it 's not that cold , really . 
but they talk about wind chill here all the time . 
so , that 's what we 're not used to . 
that 's true . 
that makes a big difference . 
so , did you used to ski when you were out here ? 
what 's that ? 
but , do you do a lot of skiing there ? 
not tons , 
but i like to when i get a chance . 
i 've only been once so far , but had the opportunity a couple times since then . 
this is actually my third year . 
and you 're going to school there ? 
but , i 'll be here a long time , at this rate . 
what 's your major ? 
it was nursing , 
but i 'm in the process of changing it right now . 
you have to have a three seven to get in 
that 's true . 
i 'm going to look into some other fields . 
all the science classes and that , i 'm just not really enjoying too much 
so i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process of going to school 
that 's a good idea . 
did you graduate in a certain field 
education . 
i got a double major . 
that . 
you might know her . 
maybe not . 
there are so many girls in all my classes , 
i ca n't remember how many people . 
because they , since stopped that program where you can get it double pretty easily . 
have they ? 
how do you feel about capital punishment ? 
you did ? 
i was on the jury . , 
which is funny because i got called last night and the topic was something about juries . 
so i am just hitting it right . 
how do i feel about it ? 
i do n't know . 
i guess it is right in certain cases . 
i was an alternate on the case , 
so i do n't know what was decided . 
they are probably still in deliberations on it . 
once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed , we met with the judge , 
the two alternates did . 
and he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy 
and i remember hearing about it . 
it was about a year ago . 
he was involved in another capital murder the very next month 
they drove up , 
the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy . 
so he was caught 
county i live in the past ten years only had two capital murders . 
and last year there were six 
and this guy is indicted on three of them . 
so you have to wonder . 
if he 's going to be drastic , somebody has to be drastic back . 
although it 's not really revenge because it does n't mean anything to him . 
he has no concept of what he has done . 
from what i can tell . 
i did n't talk to the guy or anything , 
but he does n't seem to have any regard for anybody 's life including his own . 
no remorse whatsoever . 
i guess in cases like that , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again you 've got to do something . 
i was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours . 
but at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone and do you think you 'd ever know beyond a doubt 
and i said i ca n't imagine , 
i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it i guess i could convict him , 
but i ca n't imagine you ever making me that sure of something . 
but they really did . 
it was really amazing . 
that was a subsequent case that we did n't know about . and those jurors do n't know about . 
but this particular case they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that the police had n't released 
so no one else would have known . 
it was really pretty interesting . 
educational . 
i guess cases like that , i do n't see why they would n't bring in the new evidence from the other case . 
they can , in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he has n't been found guilty of it . 
of that crime 
although , it 's not going to take much to prove that . 
that works . 
they pushing the death penalty ? 
this guy is up for the death penalty . 
for example , was the guy provoked 
and was the response reasonable given the provocation . 
and there is a number of questions 
and just depending on whether you say yes or no you can give him capital punishment 
and if you 're up to the point where he still qualifies for capital punishment , then you can look at mitigating circumstances . 
but the only result is , otherwise he gets life in prison . 
and i 'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much . 
and to me you take away a person 's freedom , you 've taken away most of their life . 
that 's true . 
but then you have to look at reality . 
i think normally they may get out 
that 's true . 
but what is it worth ? 
i do n't know . 
personally i do n't know which i would pick if i had a choice for myself . 
that 's true . 
i do n't know whether i 'd stay in prison or not 
and do they have the death penalty there ? 
they do . 
they 've had a number of cases here . 
not a whole lot , 
so that 's going up . 
but 
they have a death penalty . 
i hear of one every now and then . 
they wo n't let you on death row , 
but they 'll let you look down the hall . 
you ca n't see any prisoners 
and it 's kind of a weird feeling . 
they took us around on a tour , 
and i got to walk in the gas chamber 
and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you 're sitting there saying , people have died here . 
that 's right . 
i 'm sorry . 
if you were going to have a dinner party , what would you make ? 
let 's see , 
i like seafood . 
let 's see , 
that sounds good . 
and what would that be like , 
and that way , you can have a variety . , 
fresh vegetables would be good 
and then when you serve the meal , what type of wine would you have with seafood ? 
all these hard questions . 
what , white wine ? 
that would be my guess . 
and then , dessert . 
i 'm not really a drinker , 
so i do n't know a lot about that . 
something sweet ? 
chocolate , something chocolate . 
you must like chocolate . 
let 's see . 
you do ? 
so , we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some dip some cheese . 
and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail . 
and then i like to barbecue steaks or pork chops . 
and then lot of times we 'll have baked potatoes with them and a salad 
and then i do n't know what we usually have for dessert . 
cake sometimes , 
but that 's what we would do for a dinner party , i guess . 
that sounds good , too . 
but i guess when you talk about dinner party that 's more for when friends come over . 
traditional 
traditional , 
i would n't be the big snotty kind . 
i just really started , learning about that 
i do n't know if you 've heard of her . 
her cookbook 
and she talks about catering and goes into all that and the different types of parties different types of foods . 
do you work in a setting where you are in the food business ? 
my father owns a restaurant . 
it 's just a cafe , 
it 's not the same . 
you graduated from which high school ? 
and that 's a public school or private ? 
that 's public . 
i have to get to know this area a little better , i guess . 
is your father 's cafe one that you could cater out of ? 
it 's not . 
let 's see , 
what else for catering . 
let 's see , 
that would be good . 
could have fruits and pineapple , 
let 's see , 
and you could actually go with a chicken if you wanted to . 
i guess we 're supposed to talk about what 's being done about recycling . 
lots ? 
what do you do , now ? 
so we 've done that for quite some time , 
it 's about a fifth of what it used to be 
so the boy scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over . 
i do . 
although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that work in the library for me said they had n't gotten theirs . 
that 's why i asked you . 
i guess it does go in cycles , 
and not everyone got theirs right away . 
we used to take ours there . 
my garage was just getting overwhelmed . 
i know . 
and , of course , i did n't go weekly , 
so it became quite a big thing , 
i 'm really glad they do it . 
but i do n't use as many of those . 
i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that are really dirty that you have to wash out . 
so it was wasting a lot of time . 
wasting all your time and effort and , putting it in there . 
thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned . 
but it 's not that hard now that i 've got this system under control . 
got your routine down . 
because they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight . 
i do find that i do n't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are being tossed in with the recycling . 
that 's right . 
one thing i thought about the other day were batteries , 
and , yet , what am i going to do when i have a couple double a batteries to toss out . 
probably going to throw them in your trash . 
that 's what happens 
there are places that take car batteries , 
kind of a pain to drive over somewhere special for two little tiny batteries 
but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
is that right ? 
i do n't know what that was reading it for 
registering our garbage . 
they must be trying to keep track of who is doing it , or what , i guess . 
i do n't know . 
would n't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year . 
for those who are really cooperating . 
that would encourage it . 
except i know it would just not be cost effective . 
they 've already got all this money out on getting the trucks and hiring people to work them . 
i 'm sure they could n't afford that . 
now there is just one garbage man that comes on the truck instead of two . 
that 's interesting . 
also , slightly off the subject , but our big green garbage thing got stolen . 
it did ? 
and we called the city 
and they brought us a new one 
and they did not charge us . 
and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen . 
is n't that sad . 
it is sad . 
you know , 
they paid for those things anyway . 
and they must be really expensive . 
or , our taxes do . 
of course , we were hoping we were n't going to have to pay for it 
but what would somebody do with them . 
how do you feel about capital punishment ? 
i 'm not certain that it does a lot of good that it ends up effectively avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties . 
yet , on the other hand i do n't know , 
seems like it 's the right thing to do . 
i do n't know . 
what about yourself ? 
i have the same dilemma , i think . 
it seems right sometimes 
and then other times , you do n't know . 
and they 're extremely severe . 
i think to a certain degree , the reason that it does n't serve as a deterrent may be because you never know if it 's going to be applied . 
and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand 
and everybody knows exactly what for . 
or there is a good chance you 're going to get off . 
and also , it does n't seem like it does that many harm , 
their life is taken , 
but they 'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway , 
so i think sometimes they 'd prefer just to get it over with 
so it 's more of the easy way out than making them pay for what they 've done . 
except that the average cost to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is extremely high something , i was amazed at . per year , 
it 's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year . to keep people in jail . 
and it 's sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment , 
but on the other hand i do n't know if that is that serious that they 're really never going to be out of jail , 
but then again , also , you ca n't bring back lives that have been taken anyway , 
i do n't know , 
i know , 
taking one more life does n't get things back the way they were . 
i do n't know , 
i really do n't know , 
what state are you in ? 
where are you calling from ? 
i see , 
i guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment . 
it 's one of the quickest , 
i think it was outlawed for a while by the supreme court or , the interpretation of the constitution 
and it seems like everybody stopped 
they do it by lethal injection . 
and there they do it by hanging . 
i still remember the movie in cold blood . 
i 'm sure you 're familiar with it , 
but , have you seen the movie ? 
i have n't , 
that way . 
and they do it that way ? 
they show it , 
and so it 's not particularly graphic , 
it 's kind of a barn like structure . 
i think they 're there , 
i 'm not really familiar . 
is that right ? 
are you there in school ? 
i am . 
a long time ago , i remember my dad was telling me this that they do it by a bunch of men have guns 
and one of them has the real gun in it . 
has a real bullets 
i know that . 
i know . 
as long as you 're sort of safely removed from it , it seems not so bad , i guess . 
let 's see , 
what type of car do i want ? 
but my weekly wages do n't apply for me to have that kind of car , 
i 'm engaged to get married 
so , i 'll more likely get a car for economic reasons . 
so , to drive back and forth to work is all i 'll need a car for pretty much . 
and we have a truck , 
what kind of a car do you have now ? 
my car is really old , too , 
because i drive out of town a lot of the weekends 
and i would like my next car to have good gas mileage . 
and same here 
and a nice car , but not too expensive , 
i hardly drive , 
but while we 're talking , 
while we 're talking , my next car , i 'd like to be sporty and nice , 
but it 's expensive 
and then insurance is really high for that , too 
so , something that 's not too sporty because of insurance , then . 
i know . 
that insurance does come into play . 
i forgot about that . 
what kind of insurance do you have up there 
or is it real high up there ? 
and i 'm not sure really how much i pay . 
my mom 's helping me out because i 'm in college 
so i just give her the money and take her word for it . 
that insurance is high dollars . 
it is , 
and the more expensive the car , the higher it is 
so , unless i win the lottery , i wo n't be driving , anything too expensive . 
i do n't plan on buying a car for many , many years 
i have to make this one last as long as i can . 
what 's everybody drive up there ? 
or , do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything ? 
we do n't have any snow here now . 
there is no snow at all . 
we have n't had snow yet . 
we usually only get . 
kind of strange to you all ? 
it is . 
do n't tell me that . 
how cold is it there ? 
actually , it 's been warm , 
and that 's really warm . 
and it 's supposed to rain tomorrow 
i 've only seen snow once this year . 
and it was really bad 
and now there is no snow , 
but what is your dream car ? 
i have n't really thought about it . 
i 'm not too big on cars . 
i do n't know the names and stuff , 
but if i were to go to a car lot and look at them i would pick out one that looked really nice . 
what 's your favorite color ? 
for a car ? 
probably blue . if it was just an average , middle class car . 
blue ? 
but if i were to get a sports car , maybe white or red . 
what kind of car do you drive right now ? 
i 'm afraid it 's not going to last me that long 
and i hope it does , though . 
it 's a two door . 
i like smaller cars . 
i find them more comfortable to drive . 
i 'm sure , 
i could see why . 
you been down here before ? 
did you like it ? 
it was busy . 
it 's different i bet . 
it was nice . 
and it was really cold up here , 
so that was nice . 
i have n't been to many places , 
her family lives there , 
and she 's only been there once . 
her grandmother lives there 
so i 'm praying i get to go . , 
that 's great . 
it will be probably the most exciting place i 'll ever get to go . 
actually . 
why , 
have you ? 
i was curious . 
i was just wondering what it was like . 
where is that ? 
and it 's the western half of an island , 
and i was down there with a program from the college that i went to where we would just spend three months in a foreign country , most of them third world countries . and study the language and then do a little service project . 
that turned out to be a really good experience for me . 
i went there when i was in high school , actually 
what did you do on the farm ? 
not that much . 
i was n't a great asset to them or anything . 
and i went to a youth camp that included working at an old people 's home 
and that was pretty interesting . 
and how long do you plan to be going for ? 
two weeks . 
last time she stayed two months , 
but we 're only going to stay two weeks . 
we 're going to take a cooking class there , 
so that might be fun . 
a what ? 
cooking class , 
french cooking . 
and what else are you planning to do , if anything ? 
museums , 
actually 
i do n't think i went to any of them . 
that 's neat . 
that was nice . 
i have n't . 
have you ? 
i 'm wanting to go there . 
where have you gone first ? 
where have i gone that 's anywhere . 
do you do any recycling ? 
we do here . 
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles 
and i think that 's all they have . 
what about you guys ? 
but we 've got a couple of different places , , 
we 've got one that gives you a penny a can , 
for smashed cans ? 
and when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot . 
can you hold on for just a minute ? 
just succeed . 
i heard it that time . 
you guys only get a penny a can . 
when you buy canned drinks and stuff like that , do they charge you for the deposit ? 
you probably get charged a nickel or something like that . 
and so it 's like they charge you for the deposit , 
type of thing . 
they do n't charge us that extra nickel . 
that 's sort of nice , though . 
it really is . 
really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the price , if you want to think of it that way . 
so when we get a twelve pack , then that 's twelve cents back . 
so you guys can actually get ahead . 
but they have sort of things that you 're not reimbursed for or paid for . 
everyone does newspapers . 
everybody does newspapers . 
but they said they ca n't be smashed or else it does n't fit in their little containers 
and they 're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something . 
send it to this address , 
but let 's see , 
i tell you 
in other words , taking care of the environment is all well and good 
but if it 's going to cost you to take care of the environment , they 're not quite as likely to do it as if you get something back for it . 
as likely to do it . 
that 's true . 
so , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass on to the consumer , 
if it 's free , people will use it , 
if it costs them something , then they 're not as likely to use it . 
apparently a lot of people every time they change the oil , they just dump all their old oil down there . 
that 's good . 
and that way you do n't get near as much as you bought it for , 
but you got the use out of it 
so that 's something that i had n't looked into before . 
i guess we 're ready to start . 
what part of the country do you live in ? 
what about yourself ? 
the reason that i ask is the two conversations i 've had , have been out of state . 
i 've lived here for almost five years now . 
i see . 
you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood . 
that 's right , 
but i like it . 
you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow . 
i missed it at first , 
but now i go back there 
and i 'm a real wimp about the cold . 
so i like it here . 
it 's nice . 
that 's good . 
and i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it . 
but i do n't know , 
i 'm not sure i would want to take on those winters . 
i 'm getting older and not sure that 's something i want to do . 
i know . 
tell me where that is , 
i probably do know , 
but i do n't know it by that name . 
we 're just north of white rock lake . 
i know that area . 
that 's a nice area . 
we have some very nice homes here in this area . 
i guess they want us to describe the area , 
. that 's quite a range . 
the homes that were here earlier were smaller . 
they 've gotten larger and larger as they have developed the land . 
and , of course , it 's pretty static right now 
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy . 
how about you ? 
and , i guess we have a similar situation . 
and then we 've got bent tree right across the street 
so i do n't even know how high those go , 
but some of those are pretty big . 
those are over a million . 
they 'd all be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles . 
but , exactly what you 're describing is what happens all over . 
i 've noticed that . 
do you live in a zero lot home , 
we 've got a house , 
let 's see , 
we moved in about four years ago 
it had previously been unoccupied , 
but it had existed for three years . 
this is a whole block of homes that a builder built all of them 
and , i guess he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away , type of deal . 
so the whole block was all foreclosed . 
and , so , some were vacant for quite a while before they finally sold them because there were so many . 
was your house in good shape , 
was it damaged ? 
the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they 'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open . 
it was ? 
i see . 
and we have n't had any problems 
and we had originally thought we 'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we could n't afford anything . 
but the prices are much lower here 
and this was definitely not a fix up special , 
but i 'll tell you , 
it takes all my time . 
really is . 
i am familiar with that . 
and we bought it from someone who was in it , 
but before they had it it had sat empty for the better part of a year . 
and i 'm not sure what happened , 
but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for about four years . 
i found a lot of things , 
we 're set . 
what changes do you feel have happened ? 
i guess the first thing has been for the right , for women to vote . 
i think that has been a major change and also the fact that there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were 
and that 's probably going to increase . 
increases each year , does n't it ? 
i 'm sorry ? 
it increases each year i think . 
it sure does . 
there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays . 
role ? 
that 's changing . 
we do to some degree 
but i think it 's not as much as it was . 
i agree . 
it definitely has changed . 
and especially with women increasingly working , they 're going to have to demand more from men . 
because there is just , impossible to keep up on everything else . 
have more of an active role in taking care of children , more of an active role in taking care of the home . 
and i do n't know what the status is on it , 
but i have n't really heard much about that recently . 
you simply have to accumulate your sick leave . and take your sick leave . 
is that right ? 
and i do n't know if bigger company companies do , 
and that was the reason 
because they thought 
that 's interesting . 
it is . 
you got to take the time off . 
you have to save all of your vacation time . 
you do . 
you have to save all your vacation time 
and that 's usually how it 's happened , 
what do you see changing in the future ? 
i think that we 're probably going to see a lot more companies run by females . 
and top level . 
i 'm sorry ? 
maybe top level . 
upper management , 
more women in upper management 
and probably we 'll see more females in political roles . 
more governors and roles like that . 
that would be kind of nice . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
and her term just ended 
so i think we 're probably going to see more of that in the future . 
i think that 's probably good . 
a little more integration . 
, 
and that 's fine with me 
i think , 
there are issues that as far as equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff , i totally am for . 
i do n't either . 
i do n't think they 're ever going to prove that men and women are equal . 
we just function differently . 
and i 'm not capable of lifting what a man can lift and that type of thing , 
i 've heard of that . 
i have n't really talked to anybody that 's too involved with that . 
is that what you 're talking about , women working out of their homes ? 
i think it 's wonderful . 
you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week 
course , they 're talking about that we 're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that , 
by the phone and all that . 
so it would be kind of exciting in some ways to see a little bit more of that 
and some ways , it might be kind of scary . 
think anybody could do it , 
i would n't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up . 
but then there is the process of selection . 
would you have to give them the brand 
and when you shop , you usually compare the prices 
would be nice , though . 
do they have one ? 
they do . 
i did n't know that . 
i learned something already . 
let 's see , 
how much time do you spend with your children ? 
very little . because they 're grown . 
what ? 
they 're grown and gone . 
and the other one is in high school . 
so you do spend less time then ? 
because they almost do n't want to know us . 
they want to be with their friends . 
how old are your kids ? 
are they married or what ? 
i have two married , and then two almost married 
and the other two , i 'm not sure . 
two , for sure are single . 
you have a lot of kids . 
between the spouse and myself we have six . 
that 's kind of nice , though . 
because i came with a split family 
there is so much of them are gone 
and they 're doing their own things 
that 's true . 
they have to see their other parent too . 
and sometimes they want to do their own thing , 
so sometimes it 's just spouse and me . 
i know . 
and you know what ? 
what ? 
sometimes that 's okay . 
i know . 
that 's what my mother said one time . 
because who says that they just got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays . 
that 's true , 
and if they force them to that 's not good either . 
let 's see , 
do they all live in the area ? 
of the six , we 've got four around here . 
how did they end up so far away ? 
that 's , my little pair . and my second marriage . 
those are the youngest ones ? 
the fourth and fifth child of the , six are the two that are scattered like that . 
those are a long way . 
and they wanted to go , 
so they wanted to make their homes there . 
that 's where they 've gone to make their homes . 
are those two married ? 
they just working up there or going to school or what ? 
let 's see , 
they do . especially if they 're meant to , i think . 
i certainly hope so . 
so it 's never too late . 
i agree it 's never too late . 
especially in some of these schools around here , i think they have about twenty percent older students . 
i 've seen some people that are really quite up there 
they look like in their very late sixties 
and i say that 's great , 
why not . 
why not 
i believe that we , 
and i 'm not in that category quite yet 
but , we are seasoned minds . 
you 're really ready to learn finally . 
it was a complete waste of money . 
we know what we 're wanting to , study 
and we know our limitations . 
we do n't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning . 
at seven , 
we 're past that age . 
we 're smarter now . 
we know what we can do . 
so let 's see . 
so mine i do n't spend a whole lot of time because they 're not here . 
what was it , 
and do we approve what other , families do . 
the trends in the families were to spread apart , do your own thing . 
that 's right . 
but i 'm seeing a change that government ca n't do it , 
a change ? 
i was going to say the same thing . 
schools are not able to 
and the family 
are going to have to solve some of the problem . 
i firmly believe that , 
they tell you what our topic was ? 
i think golf , is n't it ? 
are you a hacker ? 
you bet . 
i 've been a hacker , 
i know i did , 
i know i did . 
and it 's like they do n't have a muscle in their body . 
i know , 
if i play a lot of golf , i play six to eight times a year 
and that 's about it . 
i figure that 's my retirement game . 
i come from a family of golfers . 
that was their deal , 
that 's what it takes , 
you need to play that often to get a really good handicap . 
but i just never could do it . 
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf 
i decided this past year that i was going to get out and start playing a lot more 
and i went after it 
and and i really did n't find much improvement . 
fact , ever time i 'd start trying to correct something , it seemed like the score would go back up , 
i probably need to take some more lessons and practice more often . 
i think i 'm probably the same way . 
lessons do help . 
i go to this ducks unlimited dinner , 
it 's a hunter 's type affair 
i 'm familiar with it . 
and we just have a ball , 
and we play three days in a row , three different courses 
and , course by the end of the third day and the end of the third course , my score has gone from a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five . 
if you play regular , i think it makes a big difference . 
you bet , 
so that makes a lot of difference to me . 
i try to work out regularly 
and when i am doing that and feeling loose and , that i swing better , 
i get through the ball better . 
i found as i 've gotten a little older here , i worry less about my distance . 
you bet . 
my control is a little bit better there . 
that 's super . 
i have n't learned to hit the ball easy 
i 'm always wanting to hit it hard 
and subsequently when i do tire out from playing like twelve , fourteen holes , a lot of my energy 's gone , 
when i do swing it 's an easier swing 
and i do , actually , hit the ball better . 
have you ever tried a one iron ? 
i have a two through wedge . 
i hit a two iron awful lot . 
off the tee . i do n't hit a driver off the tee . 
that 's why i need my driving lessons . 
i put mine back in my bag this year , too , 
and i used a three wood rather than a driver . 
that helps . 
i had a lot more control on it , 
but i was n't in trouble every time i got down the fairway . 
that 's a good idea . 
i think this next year , i 'm going to attempt to play more 
and i 'm going to do the same thing . 
i laid off my woods about three years ago 
and i just use a two wood off the fairway 
and i 'm a fairly strong person 
so i get a pretty good little drive 
and and i guess control my irons , better , 
if you 'll take lessons , the first thing they put in your hand is an iron . 
and i still remember that watching myself and my son 
but i think the key is you need to play more often than i play . 
i think there is less frustration factor there , too , 
makes good sense . 
the one iron is something i 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that i should pick one up and try to start . 
apparently they 're very difficult to play with , 
and i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron , 
it 's incredible . 
and his accuracy is what 's so startling with it . 
but it 's an iron that he 's really practiced with . 
he has used , 
and it would be fun to get that good with uh , distance iron . 
you bet . 
if i can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around watching you , i 'd be , great after that . 
and get away without embarrassing yourself , 
which one have you got right now ? 
couple of them , 
and i got a leading edge 
just a couple . 
what do you have ? 
it 's very , very generic . 
what did you do , 
put it together ? 
and now it 's a fast machine . 
that 's all i got to say for it . 
what do you use it for ? 
what do you use it for ? 
work , 
i 'm a contract programmer . 
anything . 
i 've done business programming , scientific applications like petroleum science stuff and test equipment 
and i did one that was , the demonstration of a touch screen for a company that sells touch screens . 
it was kind of fun . 
that sounds interesting . 
matter of fact i guess you get a lot of graphics in there . 
that 's where the speed helps out . 
it 's slow . 
that will , slow you up . 
and really need a faster system . 
who is that ? 
and my notebook is somewhere around here . 
see if i can make my telephone cord stretch far enough . 
i 've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one . 
that 's how i got my other ones by selling their product for them . 
that works . 
here it is . 
and where are they at ? 
i know where you mean . 
that 's about lookout there is n't it . 
it 's just south of there . 
it 's a little place , looks like a castle . 
kind of little guy in there . 
he , gives reasonable prices . 
that 's a good deal . 
it was pretty reasonable . 
and he does a good job 
and he , guarantees everything he sells . 
there is a lot , 
you ever go by lucky computer there ? 
i used to , 
have n't been doing much of that for the last year or so . 
so i do n't know where those guys are at these days . 
they 're still doing business . big business , apparently . 
that works , 
i 'll go do that . 
and that thing screams now . 
that was n't alive for but maybe two years . 
i thought . 
is that right ? 
that 's it ? 
when it comes on the manufacturing floor it 's about ten bucks . 
what do you think about the self insurance business ? 
i understand what you 're saying , 
and there 's probably some truth to that . 
i think that generally i do n't welcome added government responsibilities . 
however , when anybody ca n't police their own profession , it eventually leads to that , 
i think they 're asking for it . 
i think the medical profession is just pushing until there 's no option but the government take it over 
do you think that it 's just medical guys ? 
what about how expensive new equipment and technology is . 
that 's where i think most of the cost is coming . 
i think a lot of it is , 
i do n't disagree totally with that , 
but my wife this last summer when we were on vacation tore up her knee , 
and she got home , 
he knows knee problems , 
if anyone does , this guy knows it . 
she goes in , 
he says , i think this is what it is , 
a thousand dollars for this magnetic resonance imaging type thing . 
and my wife said , do i need that ? 
i suggest you go have this thing . 
insurance wo n't pick this up unless you 're in the hospital . 
doctors routinely send people in for anything . 
for years they did n't have this 
and they solved these problems , 
i said to her , look , 
if you feel you got to go , go , 
i do n't know what it is , 
but there 's , no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day . 
and even if they cost a hundred , two hundred , five hundred thousand dollars , at roughly a thousand dollars every half hour that 's ridiculous . 
i do n't care what anyone says . 
it 's a picture . 
but they are n't reasonable . 
they do n't have to pay them back in three months time . 
i 'll have to agree , with you there , 
but there 's another problem , 
if the doctor makes a mistake , he can be sure that he 's going to be hauled into court . 
i think that 's another problem , 
and that , the government eventually will address too just because it 's out of control . 
i agree with you . 
i was on a jury 
i did n't make the jury , 
but there was a , deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on an infant . 
it was three days after it was born , 
and he was the one that delivered it . 
and they got four attorneys , 
and he says , anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars , 
five million bucks is n't going to bring this kid back , 
if the doctor is wrong he should be pulled from his license , 
but five million dollars 
and away he goes because insurance pays for it , 
it does n't make logical sense to me , 
it does n't . 
do you exercise regularly ? 
i am a school teacher . 
and , us , 
turn that off , 
i am recording . 
she comes to the school 
and there are a group of teachers , 
and we exercise regularly for an hour 
and we do it twice a week . 
. that is good . 
and we do aerobics , for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes 
so it is an hour . 
and then my husband and i take ten mile walks as often as possible . 
and not on the nights that i do aerobics , but if he wants to , he jogs , 
but we take the fast walks 
and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house . 
and so , we , take it seriously . 
we enjoy doing it . 
i enjoy my group at school . 
it is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than is is to do it by yourself . 
i use to exercise regularly 
and i have n't lately . 
i use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work . 
i understand that . 
i have never been able to do it before . 
the problem is that i am so tired at the end of the day , 
i just want to go home and not do anything . 
i and too . 
i just make myself . 
i get up at five thirty 
and i am at school at seven thirty . 
school is not over until four 
but it is in the building 
that is the big difference 
you had better hurry . 
go get dressed . 
there is motivation around there 
and then we can change right there in the building . 
i do n't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere . 
and i just go 
and we exercise . 
and until then i have belonged to exercise clubs 
and i have done that before , 
but it has always had to be late at night after i have got home and after dinner 
and i have tried it immediately after school 
try to get some place and exercise from five to six , 
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late . 
that is right . 
that is right . 
it is . 
it is really hard with our life style when you work to , 
i know , some people go during lunch , 
and that is just too long . 
that is out for me . 
that does n't really do it , does it ? 
i do n't think so . 
if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late , they kind of wait on us . 
cause they know we are in the building and coming . where as , at another place , you are paying a lot more money 
and it does going to start whether you are there or not . 
that is right . 
that is right . 
so this has worked out real nicely . 
in fact , she charges us two dollars a session . 
that is not much . 
we pay her for six weeks at a time cause that is a unit in school report card period 
that is not bad . 
it beats memberships at some of these clubs . 
that is for sure . 
they are real expensive . 
i know . 
we belonged for a period of time to the signature club for about a year . 
we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership 
and at first we used it 
and then it got where we were n't beginning to get out money 's worth . 
and they offered lots of things , 
but we were n't taking advantage of them because we did n't have the time to . 
so we decided to forget that . 
that was just a waste of our money . 
we have one through work 
but i do n't know 
i still just do n't end up going cause it is n't at a convenient time or something , 
but i need to do something . if it 's only walk the dog or something . 
i need to start doing that . 
it does make you feel better . 
the hard thing is getting going . 
that is right . 
and if you have somebody who will do it with you , 
you think you 're getting your money 's worth ? 
never . 
that 's probably the next year 's agenda . 
i tell you what , 
i sure hope they do n't pass something like that . 
they 're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around , 
and i think one way or the other , we 're going to pay for the bureaucracy , i guess . 
it 's one area that is really hurting the economy more than anything . 
i think every time you turn around they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products , 
and i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now . 
i tell you , 
i remember every time , it seems like , we turned around , they 're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
even they tax food . 
i think that the problem with the sales tax , of course , is it 's an unfair tax across the board as far as ability to pay , which allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards . 
but now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of taxes on everything they buy , 
and where people make two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that , they are n't going to be paying taxes on . 
and that 's the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue , 
but i do n't think it is anymore , 
i got you , 
because people that , do n't make very much money wind up spending it all . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
whatever they spent it on , they have to pay tax on . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
but i think taxes generally are unfair 
what do you think of that new luxury car tax , anything over thirty thousand dollars ? 
like other things , if they do n't affect you , you do n't worry about them too much . 
i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still , 
i do n't have a whole of sympathy on that . 
maybe you buy that , 
i have n't , 
but to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax on top of it . 
and there 's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand . 
there are , 
there are . 
and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that unless they really want it , 
buy something , 
it 's just like having taxes on , or exemptions for kids . 
it 's a way of increasing the population , 
that was one of the initial ideas of giving exemptions on kids , on federal taxes . 
i do n't know if that 's true or not , 
but if you look on all interest things , not just credit cards , but on your cars and any kind of interest that you 're paying , from a personal point of view , that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers . 
like booze example , they keep raising the taxes on booze , 
they quit buying it . 
what about the taxes on cigarettes ? 
what are we having ? 
let 's see . 
i 'm not planning the menu . 
you 're not . 
we usually go out to either one of our folks , 
but i do n't know , 
funny you should mention that . 
i 'm a pig farmer . 
you are 
it 's kind of a hobby more than anything else , 
it was mating with the sows , 
and you ca n't use the piglets , 
it 's about six months of no use , 
so we shot him and cleaned him out and had him processed into ham , 
and rather than pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery , we 'll just cook him and eat him . 
is that hard ? 
i tell you what , 
preparing a little pig is a snap , 
i 'm telling you , 
real easy , easier than chicken . 
you kill him , 
most guys just shoot them in the head , 
in a second they 're gone 
and after about six hours , you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there , 
and it 's the best eating you ever had . 
just like a pig 
does it . 
it has a lot less fat . 
and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds . 
we took the skin and the head and the feet off , 
and that was about a hundred pounds of just ham . 
we 're not going to eat the whole thing . 
eat it all , 
it would take a year . 
it 's just tough as a boot 
and they used to use it for leather , i think . 
so it 's really a tough piece of meat 
but it 's so tasty , you ca n't stand it . 
so you just take it 
and that softens it up . 
takes about four hours to cook one . 
they weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds . 
and we 're going to have that . 
what else do you serve with your pig ? 
we still have tomatoes 
do you ? 
fresh tomatoes . 
we just got lots of snow . 
it started to freeze up around here , 
and half of that 's down . 
it 's thirty degrees this morning . 
i did n't know it got that low at night . 
it 's desert , 
where we are , it 's , the edge of the desert , 
it 's part of the great plains . 
so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred , hundred and ten 
so everything that lives around here is real tough . 
that 's trees , 
we got hundred year old trees that are twenty feet tall . 
that 's all the bigger they get , 
they 're just hard as a rock . 
go ahead . 
what kind of car would i want to buy . 
i do n't know . 
the question is would i want to buy , 
or would i probably actually buy . 
may be two different things . 
if you had all the money in the world or something . 
if i had all the money i wanted , then that 's whole different matter . 
in that case , i do n't know . 
but i do n't know if i 'd want one of those now . 
of course i would want one if somebody was given to me . 
what do you have now ? 
it 's actually the first car we ever bought new . 
my car is the first one we ever bought new , too . 
but we just bought another used car , a couple weeks ago , actually . 
me too . 
what car do you drive ? 
what is it ? 
we almost bought one of those . 
do you like it ? 
i do , 
and it 's funny because , after i bought it , i was doing a lot of business traveling , 
and mine is a standard 
and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better 
it had a lot more pickup and everything . 
you get a little more control over when it 's doing the things it 's doing . 
what rental agent did you go to to rent those kind of cars . 
to what , 
but we have corporate contracts with the various companies 
i see . 
so it depends on your destination , too . 
kind of strange . 
you work for a big company , then . 
i see . 
but 
i do n't know , 
and it really saved us some big money once . 
it did , 
they had a whole bunch of things that sort of broke at the same time 
that was great . 
it was . 
that 's unusual to hear , 
usually something breaks , 
you look at the warranty 
and it 's excluded . 
we bought the extension 
i see , 
you got your money 's worth . 
we did , 
but we really debated at the beginning , 
and of course i 'm glad i did it . 
that is good . 
but we still have three years left on it . 
i 've been lucky . 
mine has n't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it 
but i was real lucky because it just hit the lens to the light . 
bumper ? 
it did n't actually dent the car or anything . 
that was good . 
and the store will pay for it anyway , 
so . no big deal . 
if you were going to buy a new car would you buy another accord ? 
i probably would n't , just because i already have one 
but if i had to make the choice again , i 'm perfectly happy with what i decided although we did just buy another car , 
and that 's a legend 
those are nice . 
but it 's a used one 
and my husband has really wanted one for a long time , 
and the fact that this car that i have has performed so well , 
and before that i also had an accord , 
it was a real old one 
and i bought that used . 
i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that , 
and it served me real well , too . 
my sister drives one . 
is it legend 
i 'm not certain , 
but she 's liked it . 
we only had one car for a long time , 
and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth , four miles to work and back kind of thing . 
how did it go for you ? 
it 's worked . 
has n't left you stranded . 
that 's exactly what it is , 
it 's a cheap little car just to go run around town in 
i know . 
and . it 's actually kind of fun to drive . 
and it 's an automatic , 
that 's what my husband thinks about my car now , that he 's had the legend 
the steering 
you feel like you 're in a boat or something , 
i ca n't drive that , 
the legend , it 's just so huge . 
i do n't like it , 
that a little town or a bigger city ? 
it 's not one of the bigger ones . 
maybe a little smaller . 
i talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town , i think . 
i forgot the name of the town . 
i thought maybe it was you . 
we 're supposed to talk about education . 
i certainly have some ideas since i 'm studying it now in college . 
i 'd say , first of all , they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading , writing , arithmetic in grade school , 
and it shows up . 
that 's one idea . 
do you have any ? 
i do n't know , 
and my dad is actually on the school board there , 
so , i kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on . 
that 's for sure . 
it used to be the pits . 
but i 'm just speaking overall across the country . 
something is definitely wrong . 
and one thing , they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing , 
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year 
and they truly ca n't read 
so i do n't know how they expect them to pass history when they ca n't read anything even read a word problem in math . 
so that 's definitely a problem . 
another problem is you 're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do . 
so what do you think is good about the schools ? 
it depends on where you are . 
they 're all so different . 
that 's another thing about the united states . 
there 's no national curriculum , 
you may have half literature for the whole year , 
whereas in another one they 're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature , 
grammar . 
it 's up to the teacher , in other words . 
so that 's kind of odd to me . 
it depends on what school you 're in and who your teacher is , actually 
so i guess we lucked out when we moved here . 
and where our kids might be in a great school , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read . 
but do you think that there should be nationwide curriculum ? 
i do n't know . 
i just read about that the other day , 
and i had never even thought of it . 
actually it makes sense to a certain extent , 
because sometimes a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that did n't even learn what they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach according to her plan , 
so i guess if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn . 
so unless we want to keep paying for these people that ca n't make it in society , we 're going to have to do something . 
who do you think it should be done through ? . 
i do n't know . 
obviously nobody 's smart enough to have figured it out yet , 
so i probably ca n't . 
so i think that 's a start at least , going back to the basics in the early grades 
and that 's a big jump . 
i believe that . 
i did . 
through high school . 
you think about aids research ? 
aids is a nasty , terrible disease , 
and you die from it . 
so i think that they need to look into it 
and it 's kind of like cancer . 
how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer . 
i think it 'll probably be as difficult . 
how about yourself . 
i 'm certainly in favor of aids research , 
and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does . 
although it is not killing that many people now , it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem . 
and 
whose figure is that ? 
i do n't know . 
i 've just heard it on the radio . 
sometimes you hear things on the radio that , could be true or could n't be . 
i guess they 're spending a billion or so a year on this aids research . 
do you think they should spend more ? 
i think they should , actually , although , 
and i do n't necessarily think that they should fund aids research and , in the process , neglect cancer research or whatever . 
i think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general . 
i am sorry that he has the virus . 
magic ? 
i do n't know , 
i think it 's very strange that the media has n't questioned him more strongly about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that , as they probably would for a lot of other people . 
do you think he 's the hero that he 's being called by a bunch of the media ? 
not really , though i think he 's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position , 
but i do n't think it 's anything exceptional that he 's doing . 
it 's what many people have done already , who were just less famous . 
i took advantage of the opportunity when he came out . 
i talked to my kids about it 
it 's something that i had n't done before . 
that 's good . 
or i was glad he did that , for young kids , because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting . 
let 's see . 
what are some of the other questions . 
let 's see . 
i do n't have any friends that have the disease . 
i guess you might not . 
i do . 
my cousin , does , for instance . 
is it pretty nasty ? 
it is . 
he had aids related complex for a while , 
and he is now in full-blown aids , really not doing very well , and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing . 
it sounds awful . 
it 's a very nasty thing . 
is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly 
that 's basically it , that the immune system can at first slow down , 
and the white blood cell count goes down , 
that 's aids related complex , 
but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom , that 's aids 
and in that case people are prone to getting any kind of weird cancer that only animals got before 
that sort of thing , 
short term , i do n't think anything 's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it . 
are you saying you do n't think anything should be done in the short term ? 
the short term , the recession is getting top attention . 
i think that you 're absolutely right there . 
and that effectively adds to whether it 's officially on the books or not . 
and that 's got to be paid . 
so this creates a pretty serious problem that 's going to continue to be with us for a while to come . 
i 'm not really sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing , for instance , tax reductions , because it seems to me that if they 're talking about reducing the tax that needs to be paid , or the tax that 's currently being paid , then it seems to me it ca n't possibly help with the deficit picture . 
it can only hurt the deficit picture . 
and the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without bringing on serious problems for the longer term . 
so that 's the current predicament . 
my understanding is what supposedly they 're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes , they 'll have more money to spend , 
and if they have more money to spend , then that will be a spur to productivity , particularly commercial productivity which in turn will generate revenue . 
but it seems like , it 's sort of an unending spiral , 
it 's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is . 
it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do . 
first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has , with interest rates . 
i think that 's been a positive development . 
at the moment we 're doing very well on inflation . 
that 's the sort of upside to the deficit . 
it 's a sort of a piece of luck . 
that 's the upside to the recession . 
i do n't know , 
what kind of things do you think can be done in the long term ? 
can be done or will be done are two different things . 
at various places to look for cutting the budget , first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation . 
but there are various other areas such as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed . 
in the longer term we 'd do well to make , reductions there . 
i think that i agree with you certainly in the second situation , 
and i think certain entitlements i 'm inclined to agree with you , too . 
education happens to be one place where i think that we would , 
a lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which are sort of not colleges 
i see what you 're saying . 
and then the people default on the loans . 
and then they do n't provide very much education . 
i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that , around , 
how did it go ? 
it went pretty well other than the fact that we encountered some problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing , which one thing led to another , 
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain . which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over . 
like starting over , i guess . 
believe me . 
course i do n't know , 
once you get it done , then you probably wo n't have that problem again . 
it 's good for another thirty years . 
you 've got an older house ? 
that 's the thing that surprised me , because once i got into the plumbing everything in there was copper , 
is that right . 
that 's what drove me bananas , because i 'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and cement to fit them together 
and nothing wanted to go , 
so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over . 
and just start at square one . 
and then if you do it wrong . 
everything went all right . 
everything worked . 
and i just said , that 's marvelous . 
i appreciate it . 
that 's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens . 
but it all came together , 
so i felt pretty fortunate about that . 
all worked out all right . 
how about you ? 
probably the last thing i did was paint and wallpaper room 
i used the wrong kind of paint . 
this must have not been a very good quality , because it just has n't stood up very well . 
what kind of paint ? 
it was flat 
and i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss . 
so it 's supposed to wash , 
you 're supposed to be able to wash it 
i do n't know how else to explain it . 
what color is it ? 
it 's pink . 
pink , 
it 's kind of got just kind of a worn look to it . 
just did n't turn out quite as nice as i would have liked 
did you require more than one can of paint ? 
we put two coats on it , 
and it 's a small room , 
but i think it only took one can . 
you did n't have to mix paint then . 
you do mix the color as far as you start with white and then they add the color . 
you know what i 'm saying 
but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with . 
how 'd that go ? 
kind of fun , is n't it . 
that 's an education in itself . 
first of all it takes quite a few rolls , even a small room , if you 're trying to match a design . 
repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you buy your paper . 
that 's what i needed , 
and i did n't think about that . 
and so a lot is wasted . 
normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats . 
i did n't even think to look for that . 
one of them was just a different color pink , is what it ended up being . 
i did n't . 
or did you start at the edge ? 
is that how you 're supposed to do ? 
i started at one edge and went over , 
then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window 
and start right there . 
do you seem to get it straighter , 
is that the advantage , 
how do you get your main source of current events ? 
until recently i was taking the wall street journal , 
and i thought that was a good way , 
but i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things . 
it 's a week or two late , 
but that 's how i 'm staying up . 
i either watch the news 
or occasionally i 'll read the paper . 
do you like how it 's presented on the news ? 
i think the media 's a little bit too manipulative . 
they try to lead you too much , i believe , 
and sometimes they 're not very open , 
i do n't know , 
i think they 're a little bit biased sometimes . 
when it first happened it was , he was guilty , he was guilty , he was guilty . 
they try to have you form opinions or whatever , 
and then i did n't like the things that were going on when we had desert storm and stuff like that . 
basically i think they do n't present the whole sides of everything . 
so , it makes you feel like they 're wanting you to take their opinion . 
, instead of reporting the news , it 's more like an editorial on a lot of issues . 
i 've noticed that too , 
and it 's kind of distressing , is n't it ? 
and i 've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words usually just that sway the whole report by just a couple of words . 
when i was in school i was a communications major , 
so , communications . 
were you looking into becoming a reporter 
i was , 
i went with the state . 
and i went with the department of state treasurer in retirement disability , 
calculate benefits . 
i bet that 's a interesting job . 
and , working for state government you hear all about current events , about things going on within the state itself . 
so that 's another source where i keep up with current events 
there 's one that i 'm reading right now . 
it 's information week . 
it 's a lot of money . 
and it 'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more . 
it 's a lot of money . 
it is . 
and you have to stay up on stuff , 
and i bet in your job that you have to , 
do you read the wall street journal ? 
i primarily deal with the state employees , 
and i really know what the budget is , 
and i 'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has , 
and it 's just funny . 
so i do n't have a whole lot of faith in , the news . 
but it 's not always one hundred percent reliable . 
can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective ? 
i think they need to go into a little bit more depth before they would just report somebody wants to make a statement or something like that , 
because another example is the aids issue or whatever . 
someone said , i found a cure . 
the headlines on the news or whatever is , someone says they found a cure for aids . 
and then two months later it 's discovered it 's not , 
before they come out with something like that they need to research the matter a little bit more . 
i guess they do that so they do n't get scooped , so they have the big story . 
that , 
it , 
there we are . 
tell me about the car that you 've got . 
and i 'll be honest with you . 
and it does its job . 
but that car just purrs like the day it was built . 
it 's a five speed straight stick machine . 
but it 's in beautiful shape . 
that 's very interesting . 
i 've had exactly the same experience with the one that i 've got . 
l x ? 
i 'm still here . 
i 'm sorry 
what ? 
it was an l x ? 
it 's an l x , 
four door , 
and very , very comfortable car . 
and very happy with it , 
if , my only consideration were buying another car just to tool around town in and make brief trips and things like that , i would very , very seriously consider buying one . 
i think they 're extraordinarily reliable cars . 
they are . 
and it 's just an absolutely wild highway . 
there 's no doubt about that 
because i run over to crystal city , or used to , 
i 'm retiring the end of this month 
but i 'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there . 
and you 've got it , 
they 're expensive cars to keep up when they need service , 
but i 've found that i 've had a lot of luck with them . 
course i 'm a mechanically inclined kind of person , 
and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that need to be taken care of , and so forth . 
it just sits there and purrs , 
i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas . 
i know . 
it 's really amazing . 
beautiful , beautiful machine . 
incredible . 
anyway , i 've been looking at the prices of these cars and so forth , 
is that right , 
certainly some of the top end ones . 
you can still get , even the low end wagons for less than twenty thousand dollars 
so there 're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any week , 
and i sort of scan the paper and look at them , and so forth 
and that 's the other thing is that i 've never really been too terribly much of a new car person . 
i think i 've bought one or two new cars in my life , 
and i 've tended to , buy cars that are two or three , and sometimes even four and five or six years old . 
and , in fact , it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it . 
and i drive it , 
up there , maybe you guys do n't have as big a problem with air pollution as many , do you ? 
we have a terrible air pollution problem . 
do you really ? 
our summers are extremely hazardous 
that 's horrible . 
in the winter it 's not as severe . 
but if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad . 
i do n't think it 's going to go very far , 
but it was a way of triggering awareness . 
and i 've lived there most of my life , 
and we used to have the posted warning days . 
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now as far as health concerns . 
so , they 've tried to do a lot of that 
and there is a real promotion of biking 
but there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles to go everywhere . 
maybe to you and i who have grown up in some more beautiful parts of the country i think that , we become a little more aware rather quickly of what 's happening with air pollution and how horrible it really is . 
but how bad could this problem really be . 
and we 'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from the acid rain 
and they may wake up , 
how 'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain . 
it 's really a serious issue for those of us up in this sector up here . 
or does it come mostly from industry up there ? 
that causes the acid rain . 
that i 'm a little uncertain of , 
but i do know that it is a problem . 
i had talked with my parents . 
and i had asked them before , 
i went back to visit recently , about a year ago , 
and i asked them , 
let 's see , 
my husband does the majority of the , gardening taking care of the lawn and fertilizing , 
but basically he does all the heavy stuff , 
and i do all the fun stuff . 
we have it just opposite here . 
my wife works , 
so when she gets home she likes to mow . 
i see . 
and we have about ten acres , 
and she tries to mow about half of it . 
. that 's a big job . 
it 's doing real well , 
it was bare dirt in a lot of places 
and of course we water a little bit , 
that 's just too much to water all at once , 
i bet it 's beautiful . 
but we do n't do much in the way of flowers . 
we have one little flower garden that we work with . 
the rest of it is just wild flowers 
wild flowers . 
they 're about a third the size of palm of your hand 
that sounds lovely . 
the wild flowers are beautiful . 
i was thinking about throwing some in the back , just way in the back , behind the swing sets 
or , just . 
then you do n't really have to have much maintenance involved . 
my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing . 
i ca n't believe it . 
i hate it . 
a lot of women do . , 
maybe one of these days i 'll have to get out there and mow , 
but my husband takes it on , 
and i 'll help rake up the grass , 
and sometimes i 'll help him edge , 
because , we do n't have that much property , 
but we 're on a corner lot , 
so there 's a lot of edging to do 
and that 's what 's nice about living more in the country , 
you do n't have to worry about any of that . 
we do n't even have any concrete or asphalt . 
that 's nice , 
in the past we 've had homes that have n't had any side walks , 
and it 's been a little more country with the trees , 
and we do miss that . 
but we do everything together . 
actually this fall , i was talking about , 
and we 're in the process of planting 
and we 're building a stand just to the north of our house , and along the east property line 
and i think what we 're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because in the winter time when that wind comes out of the north , it just cuts right through you like you 're not even there . 
and we have morning glory 
that sounds so pretty . 
and when we leave the doors open , they fly in the house . 
they , do n't do any damage , though , 
they do n't like it in here because there 's nothing to eat 
i see . 
and when you 're as busy as one of those babies , you 've got to eat most of the time . 
i see . 
that sounds wonderful . 
we just got our last tomatoes . 
there 's nothing like them . 
they just do n't have the same ones in the supermarket . 
last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes , 
of course you 're going to lose some that way 
and the seeds go right through them . 
i see . 
to begin , 
i guess space is real important , 
so it 's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time , i guess . 
i agree 
it 's definitely new frontier stuff . 
but i guess they 're going pretty far into it now . 
star wars is not too far i do n't think . 
have you . 
what do you know about it . 
i get on a computer network all the time , 
and people are talking about the current space program all the time . 
they 're talking about new rockets that they 're designing now that are just like science fiction , 
it 's like they , take off , 
i do n't know . 
you think you 'd , go up in space if you had a chance ? 
do you , 
i think i would . 
i think that 'd be neat . 
i think i would just sitting here talking about it , 
but if the time came , it 'd be real nervous . 
i 'd be scared , 
scared me worse than six flags roller coaster . 
that 'd be pretty hairy . 
i had a tire come off of a car , 
imagine . 
depending on what was left of my technology to get me home . 
i guess they 're talking about people going to the moon and stuff , now , wherever . and opening up those stations , whatever , filling them . 
they 're talking about doing that again , too . 
i do n't know if we 'll ever see that up there . 
at least we 're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years . 
that 's all beyond my imagination really . 
but , science fiction books , 
and it 's not too far fetched what they all had in those cartoons , 
so you never know . 
and we have a lot of those , 
so you never know what may occur , 
but as far as me seeing it i do n't know . 
i do n't know , 
but i think it 's real vital important for the future generations to come , 
it 's , got the extra little oomph of interest . 
i 'm sure it 'll draw a lot more interest too , once it 's more possible , 
and they 'd go up and do things 
it 's still probably going , 
but i do n't know whether , research will go on . 
i know , 
and we do n't know who 's handling them now 
so that 's a whole different story now . 
at least that 's what everybody says . 
you 're a republic , 
you do n't want those , 
you do n't want those . . 
they splitting it all up now , 
and one of them crazy guys get a hold of it , 
you never know . 
pretty much . 
one hopes . 
but that way , you ca n't never tell that . 
kiss some butt , 
tell me about your home . 
it 's me , my wife and two young boys . 
and right now we 're in either a zero lot line or a garden home . which you might call it . 
so we do n't have a big yard . 
but when my wife and i first moved in , it was just the two of us . 
so it was enough . 
and it 's what they call a story and a half . because it 's not a full two story . where everything on top is on bottom . 
so , it 's got real high ceilings on half the house 
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings . 
and it 's about a five year old house now . 
it sounds nice . 
it 's pretty nice . 
unfortunately , the builder who built it went out of business already . 
landmark is the one who built it . 
that 's true . 
and i 'm insulating myself from that problem . 
exactly what happened to them . 
i 'm building my own house . 
that 's nice . 
and as i look out the window of my trailer , i can envision all the insulation that 's going up today . 
are you doing it yourself ? 
i used to be a builder . 
that 's nice . 
and i retired about five years ago and started college . 
i see . 
and now i 'm a college educated builder . 
there 's still no work . 
so i decided this summer that we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials 
so i did . 
that 's great . 
and the state has a law that says you can not borrow the money to build your own home . 
is that so ? 
i did n't know that . 
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house 
but you ca n't borrow the money to build your own . 
that sounds kind of dumb . 
and then it does n't sell 
and then the bank 's holding the bag . 
as you know , anything that involves the government works half as well as it 's supposed to costs three times as much . 
that 's right . 
hence the savings and loan problem we have . 
that 's true . 
but my home is fairly simple . 
it 's designed to be added on to . 
that 's good . 
i figure it 's just me and my wife 
so i want to have a shop . 
how big a lot do you got it on ? 
ten acres . 
that 's nice . 
that 's real nice . 
it 's really nice too because i ca n't see my nearest neighbor . 
he 's on the other side of a hill . 
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon . 
seriously . 
that 's pretty good . 
in the winter time , i can see another guy 
i can just make out his place . 
i 've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north . 
that 's pretty good . 
i took a lot of time in choosing this site because the house has no heating or air conditioning . 
you do n't plan on putting any of that in ? 
it 's got a very small furnace . 
and i have not had to use the heat . 
that 's pretty good . 
on the south side is all glass . 
as much as i could get in it . 
and the east side is glass . 
so it 's almost all glass . 
my wife would love that . 
there 's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows . 
she loves lots of windows . 
that 's great . 
is it a single story ? 
not really . 
it 's on the side of a hill . 
i see . 
the , residential level at the side that 's in the hill is about four feet deep . 
i see . 
and the side that 's on the other side is about six feet high . 
so i 've got a pretty good grade there . 
i 've always liked that . 
we do n't have much yard 
but i built a small deck in the back . 
but i see these magazines where dig your own deck . 
i kind of wish i had them , those size property and , one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck . 
i 'm sorry 
that 's okay , 
i did n't hear . 
let me see , 
i do n't know if that took or not , 
i 'll do it again . 
i hear you have kids ? 
you heard her in the background . 
that 's babies . 
that 's your full time hobby ? 
takes a lot of time . 
i like most sports . 
i like to do that . 
little bit of embroidery work , once in a while . 
what do you like to do ? 
i try to do some painting , although i 'm not very good at it . 
i 'm sure you probably are . 
not really . 
you like it , 
i inherited the genes that make me think i 'm creative , but not the ones that give me the ability to be . 
that 's right . 
so , i always try . 
it is n't 
and it is . 
it is , 
it 's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room . 
it depends on how elaborate you get it . 
i 've been doing that 
that 's a lot of work . 
but usually . 
and i 've gone and put the needle through my thumb a few times , trying to get it through 
that feels really good . 
so that 's not really my favorite thing to do or anything , 
but i need to do it . 
to do it , 
let 's see , 
i have a dog , and a lot of fish . 
keeping fish is my biggest hobby . 
keeping fish . 
they 're probably easier than keeping dogs , though , are n't they . 
and you probably have to clean out the tank too . 
you do n't have to do as much as i thought . 
i had fish as a kid 
and they always died immediately , 
and , what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean 
you need to let the bacteria build up , 
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance . 
i see . 
and it would kill all the bacteria , 
and so you 'd have to start all over to build that up probably . 
that 's right . 
and i do n't try and sterilize things . 
do n't go through the whole nine yards 
and they kind of need a little bit of that . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
so you 've had fish for a long time . 
i 've had them , 
i guess it 's been two years now i 've had a tank here , 
and then back at home i used to have a small five gallon tank . 
but that never worked well . 
what size do you have now ? 
that 's a good size . 
it 's a lot easier . 
not yet . 
that 's right , 
i really do . 
do you have all kinds of different fish 
real exotic . 
the expensive ones . 
they 're probably harder to take care of 
they are . 
they 're very expensive 
and when they die it 's more like an investment . 
i bet it is . 
you lost an investment 
do you have problems with the fish eating each other ? 
not really . 
only if there 's baby fish . 
you always have to isolate those . 
how do you isolate them ? 
they have breeders . 
it 's a little plastic things that sort of floats 
and you put the mother fish in there 
and then it 's got a trough underneath her 
so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough 
and there 's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber so the mother ca n't get to them either . 
it kind of works , 
but it 's also got slots in it so the water can circulate 
and on occasion if you get a real small one , it 'll fit out the slots . 
it 'll go through the slot . 
that 's right , 
but , it works , i guess . 
that works all right then . 
they do n't want the mothers to be with the little fish either . 
they 'll eat them . 
they will . 
is n't that odd . 
you would n't think that . 
and it 's funny because the one i have , every single month without fail she has babies . 
all the time , 
her variety , it says they wo n't eat the babies , 
and i 've seen her do it . 
and that just makes you sick almost , does n't it ? 
it makes you understand that things are different . 
things are different in the animal kingdom . 
. we might decide what 's proper and what is n't , 
but that 's the way it is for them . 
that 's kind of the way they do it . 
that 's it . 
survival of the fittest or something . 
because if the baby is strong enough , it can swim away fast enough and go hide . 
go hide from them , 
not really . 
i try . 
i play a couple of instruments . 
is that right ? . 
i never thought about that , 
and i was thinking 
it 's funny how many names have been used all over the country . 
tell me what kind of books have you read ? 
to tell you the truth , i 've been going to college for the last four years 
so mainly , text books . 
i was going to say , not fun kind ? 
i love to read about real people . 
to me , half the time it 's more fascinating than some of these made up stories . 
it is , 
because it 's really and truly a true thing . 
it happened . 
that was real good . 
i 'm like you , 
if it 's not a heavy biography i enjoy it . 
i used to like to read about royalty a lot . 
that was my thing for a while . 
and there was a murder . 
it was some time ago . 
seems like it was the spy went dancing , or something like that . 
it sounds like fun . 
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names . 
wonder if it was by one of those famous writers 
in fact i believe it was 
sounds like something she would write . 
i think it was by her , now that you mention it , because someone had given it to me , 
and i thought , this will be great , 
and it was . 
i 've heard that her books are really interesting , 
and they always sell well . 
brings it to life . 
i know , 
our movie stars . 
our movie stars , 
because it 's totally different concept to us . 
i have n't had a chance to read a lot lately either . 
i have read mostly novels . 
and it was one of those generation novels 
starts out when they 're small and continues through generations 
i always like those . 
and i like that . 
i have . 
is n't she fabulous ? 
she is wonderful . 
i do n't like to get one of her books 
because , i just live to read . 
i 'll skip everything just to get back to the book . 
i stayed up one night until two in the morning finishing one of hers because i could not put it down . 
i do n't know , 
how often does she come out with them . 
i probably have missed the last few since i 've been back in school . 
she writes the same thing . 
she can turn them out overnight , i swear . 
and they 're the same silly things , 
if you 've read one it 's practically the same thing over and over . 
i 've never read a whole one of hers , i do n't think . 
and think how rich she is . 
i 'm criticizing her , 
and would n't i like to have her money 
and she has millions of them . 
and then make movies out of some of them . 
i have not seen as many of hers . 
hers are so involved , 
and they 're such a higher intellectual level , because she quotes a lot . 
i think she does a lot of research , too . 
i do too , 
she could n't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers , 
but her books are just incredible . 
i do n't think they 've ever made a movie , do you ? 
i do n't think so , 
and i 've often wondered why , have n't you ? 
i really just thought about it now 
maybe it 's because they take so much in . 
i do n't know . 
maybe they 're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them . 
they 're so big 
it would be like another gone with the wind , 
i guess another three hour movie . 
and maybe that turns people off , 
but look at gone with the wind . 
i know . 
it 's about one of my favorite movies . 
it had such a bad press , 
i was n't too . 
that 's exactly what i was going to say . 
i was amazed , 
in the beginning when it was on route coming out i heard mixed publicity kind of good and bad , 
and then when it came out , all i heard was just how bad it was , that i did n't even want to get it . 
me , either . 
do you know anyone that 's read it ? 
i have n't heard of anybody that 's read it , either . 
it would n't surprise me , 
about the weather . 
very appropriate , i guess . 
you ready for this ? 
just a moment . 
guess what , 
we get to talk about the weather . 
the weather this time of year has actually been kind of unusual . 
like we 've gotten the last couple of days . 
i do n't know . 
i fly for a living , 
the weather 's been terribly unusual every where i 've been . 
you do 
so you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather . 
i imagine it 's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather . 
it was around here last night , 
i 'll tell you that . 
so . 
i know the systems have been real strong out . 
and so are you an airline pilot ? 
i am 
for southwest , 
for southwest , 
fantastic . 
is that right ? 
i imagine with all this kind of weather it makes it kind of dangerous for you . 
i would n't call it danger . 
this really is n't bad stuff to fly around in . 
i guess so , 
the air systems are reasonably calm . 
the turbulence have a little bit of chop , 
but it 's not like it is in the spring time . 
we moved actually down here from another location , 
spectacular is the right word for them . 
pardon me ? 
spectacular is a good word for them . 
it 's amazing . 
actually i 've seen it where there 's not a cloud in the sky , 
and the rain is n't falling , 
but you can see the lightening going horizontally across the sky and back and forth , 
and what a light show . 
it 's fabulous . 
cloud to cloud it can be really sensational here . 
that 's true . 
where are you from originally ? 
from salt lake city area 
and there 's always a lot of snow . 
in fact , where i grew up we were about an hour 's drive from seven to twelve different major ski resorts , 
and so there was an awful lot of snow , 
so , we had a great time . 
were you near the park cities area . 
beautiful area . 
i 've driven through it several times . 
and we do lot of cross country skiing there . 
do you think the weather is typical for this time of the year ? 
not really , 
we 've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i think 
and i 've been surprised that we have n't seen more of the temperatures that we 've got today that moved in last night . 
it 's been cold . 
it did . 
and then it warmed right back up , 
and i thought , great 
my wife was just listening here 
it froze in fact . 
it was real cold . 
but , i 've really enjoyed the weather down here , too , 
that 's real true . 
in fact , i 've played golf on , new year 's day one year . 
down here ? 
and they say six months out of the year it 's bitter cold , 
it is , 
it is . 
what are your favorite shows ? 
i 've watched that sisters a couple of times . 
i think that 's kind of a good show . 
i 've never seen that . 
have n't you ? 
. i like that one , 
and i 'm trying to think . 
i do n't even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch . 
how about you ? 
i like l a law not because it 's realistic , but it 's entertaining . 
i do like that . 
occasionally i 'll see that one . 
let 's see . 
i watch cheers sometimes . and , mostly just movies , when there 's a good movie on . 
do you ? 
when there is n't a good movie on , too . 
i kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately . 
i have a baby , 
and so i have n't seemed to have gotten out as much , 
so i 'll watch a soap occasionally . 
do you watch any of those ? 
i do n't , because i work all day . 
after a while i 'll start watching it 
for a while i 'll ask people if they know what happened 
and then i 'll just forget it . 
what ones do you get into ? 
i do n't even remember 
the last time i watched was back in college . 
it was general hospital or something 
and i maybe watched it for a week 
they would n't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera . 
how funny , 
i do n't get into them that much . 
when i 'm home , sometimes in the day i 'll watch them 
but i was really trying to think . 
i do n't even know if there 's any other shows that i watch or else . 
you said you have kids . 
how old ? 
i have a six year old , 
they watch it . 
he 's outgrown that one a little bit , 
but , i 've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby , 
and he 's entertained by it . 
so 
i do watch that one . 
they 're not entertained for too long with it . 
he 's still too little , 
but 
i do turn that on . 
sometimes i watch that . 
i think he has some interesting things on it . 
i know , 
what time is that on , 
i never see it ? 
it 's on at four . 
i 'm not home then , 
that 's why i do n't see it . 
i 'll watch that occasionally . 
i do n't know , 
there 's some real weird people that , he seems to come up with . 
is n't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange ? 
he does have some real bizarre things , i think . 
so , other than that , i do n't know . 
what 's that ? 
i guess it was n't a real good topic for us , 
but . tell me , 
. but do you have snow on the ground now ? 
there is snow on the ground . 
that 's nice . 
i wish it would snow a little bit more . 
we 've broken all sorts of records . 
we still have some highways closed , 
but just phenomenal , 
you see it on the news all the time , 
but until you 've really seen it , it does n't really hit you . 
it was amazing to me . 
so there has been some flooding 
there 's been a lot , 
it 's too bad 
but the thing is that this happens , 
in the last three years it 's happened at least once a year , if not twice . 
but the people continue to move back in the flood zones . 
so , i do n't know . 
you got to wonder how long they 're going to keep doing that for . 
i do n't think i would . 
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood . 
what a mess . 
i do , 
. this has been an interesting thing to do . 
have you made a lot of calls 
i 've probably talked maybe to five people . 
my husband is doing it too , 
and he 's talked to a few more than me , 
but it 's been real interesting and kind of fun . 
do you get paid for these ? 
five dollars . 
five dollars a call ? 
i wish i could do that . 
we ca n't get paid for it . 
do n't you have to do it , 
so what kind of home repair work have you done ? 
we 've had a lot of wind around here . 
been pulling them up or just loosening them until the rain came in ? 
i saw on the news . 
but you 're still getting a good bit of the rain , though . 
we did have a little bit of rain yesterday . 
so far we have n't had any today . 
and i suppose that means i should be getting up there to look at that shingle , 
but i had something else planned today , 
so i guess i 'll let it go awhile . 
they 're wood shake . 
that should be a lot of fun . 
did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them ? 
we just bought the house last year , 
so , i 've just recently had to start looking at it myself . 
so , it 's a small problem so far , 
but i guess you just have to keep on top of it . 
what kind of roof do you have ? 
we 're in campus apartment buildings with flat top , 
then you do n't have to do too much with it . 
not too much . 
have you got pretty well pitch on that roof , 
or is it pretty steep ? 
it 's pretty steep . 
parts of it are steeper than others . 
i imagine , 
i imagine . 
that would be just too much of a fall for me . 
was the house reasonably new , 
or you been doing some remodeling work on it . 
it 's actually just twelve years old , now . 
that 's pretty new house yet . 
but just take good care of it . 
thing is , the main thing that we 've had with this house recently has been some squirming of the foundation . 
that sounds like a lot of fun . 
usually what you do is just wait until you think it 's stopped , 
and then you patch them up . 
what is it 
it 's all drywall 
drywall . 
wood framing ? 
but somehow or other that does manage to show these little cracks . 
i do n't know quite how that works . 
maybe it is n't drywall . 
i do n't really know . 
i think it is . 
i expect that 's what it is , 
and made for kind of a hard shell on the drywall . 
i think that 's the way this is done . 
that 's good . 
the previous owner had a major problem with it , because probably a variety of things . 
do you have any children ? 
how about you ? 
i have three , 
so we kind of got different ball game 
do you feel like you have any time , to spend with them ? 
they 're probably at an age where they do n't want to spend any time with their parents . 
that 's true . 
you actually , of course , spend less time with them when they get older , 
but it 's , of course , still really important . 
i 'm a librarian 
and i work two nights a week at the senior high school library . 
they keep it open for kids to do their work 
and then the school district hires an aide to work for me . 
my son is my aide . 
that 's nice . 
so , two nights a week for four hours we 're stuck together 
you 're stuck together . 
and there 's usually not very much business . 
some nights it 's just real , real quiet . 
i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part . 
so i have sort of a captive audience , 
so i really do spend probably more time with him than most . 
but of course i 'm away from my other son those hours , too . 
but his dad 's at home pretty much that time . 
and so that kind of gives him time with his dad , then . 
that 's true , 
gives him a little bit of that individual time . 
but it is hard , once they get that age , 
their friends are the most important thing there is . 
that 's right . 
i 've even noticed that with my five year old . 
and every day that she 's not at school she thinks we need to have someone over and play 
it 's kind of hard . 
it 's hard , 
i think i find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that i should . 
i 'm more worried about , i did n't , 
the kitchen needs to be cleaned 
this needs to be done , 
and it 'll still be there tomorrow . 
that 's true . 
but that 's kind of hard to do . 
it is hard to do , 
if you 're kind of a person that likes things organized or neat 
then i think it is hard . 
i think one of the nice things about holidays is that it does give you the opportunity to spend more time with family . 
slow down a little bit . 
and we 're not this year , 
and it 's just really nice because we can do the things you want to do . 
you can do more than when you travel . 
that 's right . 
this is the first year we 're staying home , too , 
and i think it 's going to be real quiet 
but that 's an opportunity to get out the games 
we usually do that , 
of course . 
but every now and then he 's got a lot of those hard kind , , 
and he wants to be an engineer , 
so he still likes all that kind of building stuff 
and we have the train , 
so he sat down , 
and i told him i really wanted him to build the train , and we would put it under the tree , and that i would keep it together , 
i would n't take it apart 
would n't take it apart after that . 
that 'd be kind of fun . 
those kinds of things never happen 
i think that 's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family , 
usually people are not sitting in front of that . 
and you ca n't communicate while you 're doing that ? 
that 's right . 
i should n't say i could not , 
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something . 
me too . 
i do n't watch very much of it at all , to the extent that sometimes i feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that 
because they talk so much , 
how can you watch that 
you 're kind of what are you talking about 
it 's the best show on , 
i do n't know . 
you feel like you 're a little bit out of it , do n't you . 
i really enjoyed , 
and so that was nice . 
i like driving to different cities because of the scenery , 
so that was nice . 
i 've been all over the states except for pretty much east . 
how far do you usually end up driving 
you 're from where ? 
that 's quite a ways . 
it is . 
but it was too crowded 
but , there 's lots of fun places to see . , 
that 's true . 
that 's something do to , 
you like to get up in mountains 
do you have any mountains nearby ? 
pretty flat , is n't it ? 
what vacation have you enjoyed the most ? 
it 's pretty fun . 
there 's a lot to do up there . 
it 's pretty busy , though , 
you have to like crowds . 
what is it ? 
it 's a huge amusement park , 
they have water slides 
and it 's just a big , big tourist attraction . 
the downtown is all little shops and candy shops 
and , it 's really neat . 
i do n't think hardly anybody lives there , 
because it 's just kind of tourists . 
probably a city in itself , kind of ? 
it 's mostly a summer place . 
summer place . 
how far away is it ? 
so that 's nice . 
it 's a pretty ride up there , too . 
it 's really pretty . 
it 's nice out there . 
i like all the nature things there are to look at . 
you 're in a climate that 's kind of humid , 
so you have probably a lot of green , and lot of real pretty things . 
our climate 's real dry 
where is that ? 
most of the land 's pretty brown . 
where 's that ? 
i have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that i 'm on the phone . 
and it 's fine , 
it 's nice . 
it 's , uh , lot different kind of . 
and it 's a real different land and scenery than there . 
it 's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity , and things like that . 
and they 're gorgeous 
those are kind of fun places . 
and the lake goes on forever , 
and that 's real pretty over there too . 
me too 
me too . 
unless i 'm going somewhere warm for the winter . 
that 'd be nice . 
the only things that i have returned have not been faulty , 
it 's been because of the size or some problem like that . 
i really have n't had to return things because they did n't perform the way they were supposed to . 
most they have a pretty good guarantee , 
and it takes them less than a day 
and they 're broken in one way or another . 
maybe those type of products should be for older kids . 
what age are your children ? 
i have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them . 
and i do n't think they 're unduly rough , 
but maybe they are . 
i do n't know . 
and they 're easily lost and easily broken 
seems to me that that became a craze when she was already third , fourth , fifth grade . 
so she was n't in it for very long before she was out of it , 
but i do n't remember her breaking a lot of stuff . 
i do n't . 
but i also do n't remember lots of little pieces 
they 've got so many different things with it now . 
that 's one thing they 've got . 
and less than a week later the arm was broken . 
but they were real good about replacing it . 
that 's one nice thing , is they 're real good about replacing it . 
i guess if they 'll replace them , then they assume they should n't have broken . 
those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way 
any direction . 
she 's not that big of a girl that i think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could . 
that was about it . 
that was about it . 
and the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics . 
is that right ? 
do you see that there 's a big problem with electronic things ? 
not really . 
we have n't had that much problem with things that we have bought . 
they seem to last . 
in fact , when they offer us extended warranties , we do n't buy them because we find we do n't need them . 
do n't buy them because you do n't need them . 
and it seems like it 's just an added tack on . 
plus a lot of the credit cards now will guarantee , 
if you purchase on your credit card then they put an extended warranty on it if it does n't work or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time , 
so it seems like it 's a waste of money . 
you almost assume if you 're going to have problems with it , it 's usually before that warranty would expire 
the first one . 
and on a recliner once i bought an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that , 
and i never used it . 
you never even needed it . 
and so it seems ridiculous . 
when they do go out , it 's either something my husband can buy the part and fix 
or it means it 's old enough that it 's time to replace the whole thing . 
it 's time to replace it . 
i think these extended warranties are gimmicks , really . 
i do too . 
a lot of it . 
and it was ridiculous . 
and they charge you a pretty good price for them too . 
they 're a pretty healthy price , 
and you 're trying to think maybe i 'll need this . 
my husband finally just put his foot down 
i do n't know . 
and he said we 're not going to buy any of these anymore , 
you probably got your worth out of it anyway . 
so we really have been fairly happy with things , 
but now we take good care of things 
and we do n't run out and buy a lot of things either . 
and since our kids are n't little anymore , i 'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken . 
you probably are real careful of the brands you buy 
you look at the consumer guide . 
and you go around 
i have a motor home . 
rough type ? 
motor homes can be a lot of fun . 
they really are . 
they really are . 
i 've enjoyed it . 
but one of these days i 'm going to try that , too . to go visit the national parks and state parks and , just get out and see nature . 
that can be a lot of fun , too . 
how about you ? 
how great . 
it was wonderful . 
nights were cool enough to where they 're comfortable . 
and the days were nice and warm 
and , it was beautiful , beautiful few days . 
that 's great . 
it worked out particularly well , especially considering she was six months pregnant . 
so , i do n't know , 
it worked pretty well . 
nice and quick and easy to put up . 
packs away nice and small 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
it was a lot of fun . 
that 's got to be beautiful territory . 
it 's gorgeous , 
i love the big trees . 
just the drive up the coast line 
and then cut over into the parks , 
it 's gorgeous , though . 
what , 
but that 's my first trip back in thirty years maybe . 
it has to be . 
do they still have the scenic roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees ? 
they do n't , 
the first time i was there , the tree was still standing , 
but it has since come down . 
but , they are huge . 
there is lots of pretty country further west . 
we 're hoping one of these days soon after we 're out of school to head that way . 
they seem to be trailing out quickly . 
because there is lots to see . 
and the painted desert is real pretty , in a different sort of way . 
i imagine . 
i would imagine they are . 
course , i guess i 'm partial to big tree country . 
i think it 's called a job , 
i do n't know . 
not a whole lot of forestry down there , is there ? 
not around here . 
not around here . 
lot of concrete and glass . 
i took three weeks . 
three weeks . 
and i was actually on the road a little more than three weeks . 
the whole family , then , was in on this ? 
everybody . 
that would have to be a blast . 
it really was , 
it was great . 
what , 
the cowboys are my favorite team . 
that 's pretty easy to say nowadays . 
lot easier than it was a couple years ago , 
but they had a big win today . 
did you get to watch it ? 
i did n't . 
i have been at my computer all day 
are you a cowboy fan ? 
i used to be a real big cowboy fan 
it 's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan , though . 
they 've always been my favorite . 
and i guess i still have a soft spot . 
i just hate that that 's the coach that 's leading them . 
they 're in the playoffs ? 
they made it to the playoffs finally 
they won like just one game 
and so pretty fast turnaround . 
but this year they made it to playoffs 
and today was the first game 
so everybody 's really going crazy down here . 
i 'll bet they are . 
they 're going crazy , 
so they turned it around , 
but they have a lot of young exciting players now , 
but now it 's like they 're doing good 
so everybody 's forgotten about that . 
football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world . 
hit a bad season and it 's the coach 's fault , 
let 's dump him . 
first good season , the coach can do no wrong . 
. 
they have a young team . 
it 's a lot different than the teams they used to have where it 's the same old players every year and same coach , same everything , 
so , now it 's like a taste of something different . 
they 're all not mister nice guys like they used to be . 
now it 's tough and dirty team 
so everybody is really excited . 
who is the competition going to be ? 
but we beat them already . 
so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl , 
but it 's just that we have to play every game away , 
it 's going to be tough , 
the competition are teams that they 've already beat this year , 
and we beat them 
but we should beat them . 
everybody feels like we should be able to beat them 
so everything 's , looking real good . 
and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we played . 
the cowboys are on a roll . 
they 've won six or seven in a row now , 
so they 're supposed to be the hottest team in the league going into the playoffs 
they 're playing tonight in fact . 
i tell you , 
they 've not had much of a team this year , 
they 're doing good tonight . 
are they ? 
i have n't been watching . 
they 're winning . 
good for us . 
and that 's right , 
i forgot about that . 
is that where he went ? 
but , the cowboys did good today . 
i was proud . 
i thought they would get beat today because they 're so young , 
playoffs , 
are you presently looking for a used car ? 
as a matter of fact , i just bought one . 
just bought one . 
just within the last three weeks . 
what did you get ? 
i was wondering where that came from 
it sounds like it , 
but it really is n't . 
it 's marketed , of course , it its own dealerships . 
usually , 
sometimes they do that , 
but it 's a brand car , 
but i 've really liked it . 
it drives just wonderfully 
it 's so quiet , 
almost ca n't tell the engine is running . 
that 's their big selling point other than general luxury 
but the particular seems to be the quiet ride . 
it really is . 
it 's got pretty good acceleration , too . 
it 's got a c d player in it , 
so i can play those 
that was n't a standard , feature , was it ? 
but there is not very many options on that car . 
there is only about five or six options . 
everything else is standard . 
i think that 's already on most of them , 
this is probably suspension tied into the brakes . 
and also the suspension can be raised for driving in the ice and snow . 
snow does n't happen very often . 
if it does , people go , what 's this stuff . 
we got a pretty fair amount of snow . 
you had some there . 
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they 'd seen in twenty years , 
i know . 
they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked . 
and the moon roof is also an option . 
although most of them are ordered with it , 
but there really is only about a half a dozen things 
and everything else is pretty standard . 
you go out and get in that real cold car 
it 's a package deal . 
and you turn that on , 
and those two are sold together 
so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to , do it , 
so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a c d or not in the stereo system 
and that was pretty much it . 
and they had like three or four basic packages that they offer . 
they did n't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got . 
imagine , or not , 
i 've seen that in the dealership . 
i usually lease them since i own a business 
i just run it through my business , 
like sitting in your living room . 
it really is , 
adjustable ? 
adjustable power 
what do you think about the school system ? 
i think they 're having a lot of trouble right now . 
i know my son goes to a private school , 
but i think big city public schools by definition are having a tough time right now probably from budget cuts and everything else going on . 
why did you choose a private school ? 
i had one that needed to be able to be moved along at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school , 
public school . 
has he ? 
then how does he like it ? 
he 's loved it . 
he is a senior in high school this year 
so he 's been there all the time . 
he 's done it the whole twelve and so many years 
and it 's been really good for him . 
how big of a school is it ? 
overall on campus about twelve hundred , but in the upper four grades , about four hundred and something 
so it 's maybe a hundred per grade . 
a hundred per grade , that 's a good size . 
it really is . 
we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture 
and he 's done really well , 
that 's good . 
and he was just ahead at an early age 
and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program . 
and i just did n't think that was going . 
i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead every day . but yet still be with his peers age wise . 
you 're just getting started . 
i 'm just , starting her , 
but seems to me that kids these days can really get away with murder 
and the teachers are n't respected as much 
and they have to be so careful of the things they do and say . 
i know . 
that 's a big problem . 
and makes me a little nervous that students do n't seem to show that respect 
we would n't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school . 
would n't have thought of it 
and they 'll stand there now with them toe to toe 
you would n't . 
and the things they can say and do to a teacher i think that 's wrong . 
i think we need to get back to show some respect 
and , course , i guess the teacher used to warrant that 
but a lot of times it 's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be , basic respect for elders and adults particularly in responsible positions , 
for other people 
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands . 
how do you think that that 's happened ? 
you think our society 's just stopped talking out , 
or this generation 's just kind of changed a little bit , 
the world changes , 
so obviously , kids are not the same now as they used to be . 
they 're exposed to a whole lot more things . 
they have a whole lot more variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age , 
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time , 
and i just do n't think that this does n't always get emphasized anymore , 
that just is n't coming through is it . 
we used to have to wear dresses 
had to wear dresses , did n't you ? 
and then you had to , go to dresses , 
and it was polyester 
and it had to be matching 
and when it was skirts , it was get down on the floor 
and we hold the ruler up here 
and it 's no more than so many inches above the knee . 
so it 's really changed . 
it 's really kind of gone the rounds , 
they say you kind of act how you 're dressed a little bit , 
i think that probably does have something to do with it , 
this school your son goes to , do they require to wear a uniform 
put some shelves in 
and some odd stuff around the house 
and i do it out of hobby more than something i have to do . 
how about yourself ? 
i like to think of it as a hobby , 
but i guess also , partly out of necessity . just repairing things around the house . 
a few years ago they needed some book shelves 
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves 
and it actually worked pretty well 
and over the years i 've refined those plans . 
and i 'm very good at making book shelves . 
my wife kind of laughs , at me that anytime i get stressed out i just go out in the garage and we 've got more book shelves . 
i 'll have to come and see them . 
that sounds like a good idea . 
and that is right , 
it is out of necessity because lot of the things that , we ca n't be able to afford , 
but also i sometimes think that i enjoy doing that 
and i like to get out and , to work with my hands 
and sounds like you got some real nice tools , too . 
do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools ? 
little by little , 
i started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things . 
a entertainment type center ? 
and it , works well because you can design it to suit whatever equipment you have 
and that 's worked pretty well . 
or 
i 'm aware of that . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
so that 's good . 
that 's good . 
but what i need next is a good table saw . 
it takes up less room . 
you set the wood down 
and you move the saw . 
but 
a table saw does take a lot of space and is a pretty big investment . 
that 's partly my problem now . 
i do n't have room for this . 
where we lived before up north basements were common 
and , i used to put all the stuff in my basement , 
they do n't have basements . 
i 'm from up north also 
and , 
there 's no basements down here 
and it 's kind of hard to get shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that . 
lot of the equipment , too , that i 've used in the past i 've used in school 
i do n't know , 
so , i do n't know , 
and i think the main thing is , like you say , it 's a good out . 
it 's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day 
and it 's a great stress reliever . 
in school i have 
and i 've made different things tables for chairs 
and i 've made bowls , 
what do you think about child care . 
my feelings on it is i would n't take a child to day-care . 
you know ? 
probably find someone , 
how come you would n't take them to a day-care ? 
too many kids and too many infections and things coming in . 
i do n't know , 
then all the things you hear about them . 
i 'm sure there 's some good ones , 
it was a preschool day-care type of thing . 
but i liked it some ways 
and some ways i did n't . 
i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important . 
how was it ? 
i think they had two teachers 
and i think there were twenty kids , 
but i only had her going two days 
and most of the other kids were going more days 
she went , 
one thing i noticed is just , they were trying to , teach her to write her name , 
and i did n't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way not in a natural form . 
she did ? 
she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff . 
wrapping her arm all the way around . 
and i had n't worked with her on writing at all at that point . 
she was four , or three , 
it was last year 
and then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on 
like i said , i did n't notice it till then . because i had n't worked with writing letters or anything and stuff like that . 
they 'd never picked it out , though ? 
or just never said anything . 
course , like i said , i took her two days a week 
my main reason for taking her was just social skills more than anything else . 
just , i did n't feel like she was mature enough socially 
one thing that 's kind of different , too , though , a preschool than taking a infant at a day-care where they 're taken care of . 
i think it would be hard to take them to people you do n't know . 
preschool 's a different thing , 
i do n't know , 
it 's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long . 
i think it 's hard to leave them , 
it is . 
it is . 
the older ones it 's not , 
you do n't even really have any real worries , because you know that they 'll play with whoever 's there 
and they usually adapt pretty well . 
it is just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will . 
and you know kind of their schedules 
and you know if they 're upset and that type of a deal . 
i do n't know how people that have young kids working work full time and do it , really , without being stressed out all the time . 
i do n't know , 
then on the other hand i think it 's harder to stay home in some regards . 
it 's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you 're doing something productive , 
and at the end of the day your house still feels like it 's a mess , 
and you have n't got anything done 
what am i going to fix for supper . 
it 's kind of hard to always feel , is this important what i 'm doing 
the work never ends . 
that 's for sure . 
it does n't . 
i just think it would be hard to do that full time . 
or is everything okay . 
universal health insurance , 
that 's right . 
is that what you 're thinking the subject is about ? 
what would we like to say . 
i think that 's what the subject is about . 
did you read the article in the paper today about this particular subject ? 
in the morning times ? 
i guess i did not . 
and there 's fourteen other states that are considering it . least according to the article in the paper this morning . 
i think it 's a trend that probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need . 
it 's getting to a point that you have to have it , 
you have to have some form of health insurance . 
extremely expensive , though . 
we live in a society , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will say that they think that everyone has a right to health care . 
and yet , i do n't think we 've ever quite decided who 's really supposed to pay for it . 
that 's the thing , 
unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are paying for the people that do n't have health insurance . 
we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that 's more fair . 
you have health insurance ? 
i do . 
through your company ? 
through my company , 
but i have been in a situation recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year 
and my wife developed cancer . 
we did n't have any insurance . 
that must have been hard . 
because it was a life threatening situation , it was very good . 
it 's not free , 
but it 's a situation that because i did n't have any insurance and i was on unemployment , it was paid by the county . 
is it affordable ? 
so you did have a good experience . 
i had a bad experience as it turned out . 
is your wife better , i hope ? 
she passed away . 
i 'm real sorry . 
that 's all right . 
that happens . 
it does happen , 
but it 's very sad . 
but in any event i 'm in favor of national health . if i had to vote for it . 
so am i . 
actually i 'm a pediatrician 
is that right ? 
it 's very complex , very complicated , 
and my mom worked for the county health department 
we had a dentist come to our school and check our teeth once a year at least . 
and when my children were growing up , we did n't have that . 
we had to pay for it , which i was n't opposed to paying for it . 
i had the money to pay for it , 
but i 'm sure that there were people that do n't . 
and so much has gone up so much . 
i do n't know , 
it is interesting , 
did not know that . 
so one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care . 
and it 's pretty overwhelming to me . 
all set , then . 
what do you think about it ? 
i think it 's a real good concept . 
drug testing procedures would have to be refined . 
from what i 've seen on the news , there 's a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy , poor procedure in drug testing . 
i did n't realize that . 
there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their , test , 
but they did n't know for sure what it was , 
but it was a drug , 
so they got turned down 
and turns out it was a prescription . or people getting somebody else 's blood test . 
that 's right , 
i do n't remember what they call it , sort of like a positive , negatives or some kind of word they use when you get a positive indication of drugs , but there were n't really any there . 
every now and then there 's an error 
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated . 
so do we , 
everyone coming in . 
i guess i did three years ago . 
everyone coming in goes through the drug testing procedure 
and they talk about it as better for the country and better for the working conditions . 
i know we did in the military , 
but i do n't know if once you 're in they continue to do it , 
but i guess you 're always on call for it . 
and about a year and a half ago they instituted a , drug and alcohol testing program . 
as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a blood test . 
but i think the big problem , though , is they send these off to large labs 
and then they have thousands and thousands of samples going through it in a day 
and bottles get mixed up , things like that . 
it 's a good idea , 
but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better . 
then he 's been working for the company for a while , too . 
good company 
he 's telling me about good profit sharing and all that , 
that was a great place to work . 
it 's good news . 
two or three years in with them you can start buying stock 
but you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while . 
that 's what my brother was telling me . 
that 's good deal . 
i have n't done this in a couple months . 
how long were we supposed to discuss for ? 
you 're supposed to get five minutes . 
we got a couple more minutes then , i guess . 
think what else i can say about that . 
let 's see , 
everyone coming in goes through the drug test . 
were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through 
let me think about that . 
it was after , i had already been hired . 
you get hired , 
then you come in the first , 
i ca n't remember . 
that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test . 
maybe it was during the interview . 
i came up a couple times for an interview , 
so it 's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened . 
they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment , 
so i 'm sure that happened to me , too . 
, it was after i was already working there 
and they were n't testing any of those who were already working . 
we have rain couple times a year 
and then other than that there would n't be any rain . 
especially the last few years . 
it 's kind of been a drought out there has n't it , 
and i 'm glad to see there have n't been any this year . 
yet . 
yet . 
still could come , 
then by march things are getting warm again , 
so we really do n't have , as long a cold season as people up north . 
it 's so hard to predict here . 
lots of times . 
today it 's not bad out there . 
it 's nice . 
i just came in from outside 
and it 's really pretty . 
it 's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out before it rains again . 
and so , it 's better for us if it has n't been this totally wet before we go . 
we camp year round . 
that 's interesting . 
but it 's definitely different . 
and then , i guess you 've been through a couple of summers here , too ? 
i have 
and they 're not too pleasant . 
it gets so humid . 
to me it 's humid here . 
it is . 
central . 
central valley . 
so that was , dry , but pretty even climate , was n't it ? 
it 's very dry there . 
it 's pretty hot in the summer . 
for a good three , four weeks we have over a hundred degrees . 
but it 's a dry heat . 
hundred , when you have a hundred here , everybody 's dying . 
i know . 
and that 's a tropical climate 
and it really feels similar to this during the summer . 
or was that just vacation or something ? 
it 's an organization where we are looking to translate the bible into languages of the world that are n't yet written . 
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages . 
languages that do n't have anything written yet . 
so this is the first thing that 's written down 
or first an alphabet is developed 
that 's interesting . 
you do n't think about that as a normal career , when you 're thinking of things that people might be doing . 
it 's based here , 
so you 're with the home office now . 
right now i am . 
that 's what brought me here , 
the weather does change fast 
and things do happen severely a few times a year , 
but there 's an awful lot of good weather , too , in between . 
i agree , 
i agree . 
i thought the fall was really nice . 
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice , too . after the last freeze 
and that 's nicer . 
you probably do a lot of that with scouting . 
i do quite a bit of that . 
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here , 
and i was fortunate not to have to serve in the theater , 
however , my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation . 
i 'm of the old school that believes that the contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored . 
however i think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker . 
but those are my personal thoughts , 
and we managed to come out losers all the way around . 
and so this is what ultimately triggered us united states per se deciding to get out of the role of world policeman . 
your views , 
and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another , 
i question us now , 
so , we have to deal with the situation as we played it . 
do n't get me started on those people . 
i just do n't want anything to do with her any more , 
because you support your government . 
right or wrong ? 
right or wrong , 
i do n't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong , 
i did n't realize that we 'd signed some type of deal like that . 
one moment . 
fascinating . 
sorry for the delay . 
that 's okay . 
it was complicated , 
and i do n't think everybody knows the whole situation . 
i do n't . 
and we did n't do a whole lot better . 
i had thought that they had colonies there , or something . 
that was the old french colony , 
we go in as an ally to the french and says we 'll help you out , if you get in a bind . 
they got in a bind and says we do n't want to play any more 
i missed it . 
roughly . 
i was just probably three or four years , 
what kind of foods would you have ? 
i like to cook 
i do too . 
if i have people over for dinner , i like it to be nice and relaxed . 
you ca n't enjoy it . 
and so i do n't like when they arrive , for me to be completely worn out . 
everybody just says how wonderful it is , 
and it 's , 
that 's one of those things i got famous for in college . 
it 's i ca n't really give you a recipe 
you 'd just do it . 
i can just do it . 
i like doing that kind of stuff . 
and it 's fun , 
we just had a bunch of people over 
. i like that . 
i do too , in fact . 
and naturally this is appropriate because i 'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night . 
actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays , just because it 's real easy , is just baked potato dinners . 
and have three or four couples come over , 
that 's fun . 
but it 's inexpensive 
and you got a great dinner . 
that 's a good idea . 
it 's real easy , 
i like doing that part . 
i 'm in favor of very little clean up very little planning because we 've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games , 
we invariably end up at my house since i 've got two kids . 
and it 's fine , because then i can just say , , 
you bring this , 
you bring this , 
you bring this , 
we 're done . 
and it 's pretty cool . 
that 's good . 
one of my favorites is to make chicken and rice . 
you do n't like it ? 
i love it . 
you do , 
i have a really easy recipe for that , where you just brown the chicken 
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan , 
and you can put mushrooms in if you want , 
how neat . 
and every once in a while , i 'll slice white grapes 
and , that 's just because i 'm not a real big wine person 
but i like it , 
it adds something to the chicken . 
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice . 
i 'll keep that one in mind . 
i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant kind of . 
or . 
let 's see , 
what was it , 
three quarters of cup of rice 
you can really vary it . 
i ca n't remember . 
i use that for rice 
flavor . 
. that would be good . 
let 's see . 
i think it was an hour . 
i 've done it in the microwave so often lately because , it 's really easy . 
i do microwave too , a lot . 
but , i think it 's about an hour . 
how long would it be in the microwave ? 
or maybe it 's only half hour . 
do you just brown the chicken to get it colored 
or do you go ahead and let it cook through ? 
i 'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster . 
this is a beneficial call . 
i like this . 
i liked your idea too , there . 
but that one 's an easy one . 
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup and the wine 
i 've got a two year old and a four year old 
and they love it . 
because my daughter calls it her gravy 
and she thinks it 's wonderful , 
do you have any pets now ? 
we do n't right now , 
i grew up with pets . 
my folks and i always had a dog and a cat , some , birds , 
but right now we do n't have anything . 
what about you ? 
it seems like , we 've always been at a place where we 'd have to go away for the summer or something 
and it was , never convenient to have anything . 
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house . 
we can take care of it and everything . 
we 've got , some children who would just really enjoy having an animal a dog , i think 
and , what about you all ? 
right now i 'm a student , 
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that . 
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat . 
is that right ? 
they 're very strict about it . 
but you like pets and things ? 
i love animals . 
our house when i was growing up there was almost never at least one cat in the house . 
but always cats in the house . 
we , enjoyed them . 
we like pets , 
but you 've got to deal with taking care of them and feeding them and everything like that . 
we 've got some children 
and they 're not used to it on a daily basis . 
how old are your kids ? 
from fourteen down to seven . 
you sound like you 've got some small ones in the background . 
one . 
is that right ? 
our first . 
where are you from ? 
originally ? 
i do n't know how familiar you are with that area of the country 
that 's pretty much the south end of the state , or the southern quarter of the state , anyway ? . 
right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown . 
that 's interesting . 
so it 's really up north in the country , really . 
i guess so . 
i see . 
it 's pretty nice country up there ? 
it 's beautiful . 
hills , or what ? 
there 's individuals growing their own food . 
most of the agriculture , it 's more in the way of sheep and cattle . 
and even that 's small time mostly . 
the biggest chunk of what 's going on there is , industry . 
it 's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants . 
aluminum plants . 
there 's two aluminum plants . 
computer engineering . 
what year ? 
just finished up my fourth semester . 
i hope that works out well . 
it 's a big change . 
did you ? 
you 've got some experience behind you in the work force . 
hope it 's a good program there . 
hope it 's a good program there . 
that 's considered a pretty good program . 
but it 's worth it once you get it . 
that 's good . 
and probably a good student teacher ratio and things . 
most are pretty small . 
that works out real well . 
i was wondering what , if you all were to get a pet if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere , 
what would you get ? 
i 'm partial towards the larger dogs . 
our last , we 've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus . 
and they got , to be a lot of fun . 
you bet . 
they tell you our topic ? 
pets . 
you 've got it . 
do you have pets ? 
we do . 
my wife and i have a dog that soon be eight years old , 
and we have a cat , which is about five years old . 
how about you guys ? 
we have three dogs and two birds at this point . 
three dogs . 
what kind of birds do you have ? 
enjoy them ? 
have a ball with them . 
you let them out and let them fly around and everything ? 
because my dogs chase them . 
and i apologize if you 're a bird lover , 
but we had a parakeet . and , my fault , put up our first electric fan . and never thought about it . 
knocked that parakeet right out of the air . 
we had that happen once , 
my son had the bird back in his room , 
because the first one that we had was his bird , 
and i had a ceiling fan put up , 
and the bird got away from him one afternoon , 
and that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall , 
i thought , so much for the bird . 
it killed him ? 
he 's still alive and kicking . 
it killed ours , 
i guess we did n't have it high enough or he did n't get hit in just the right spot , 
but it threw him up against the wall , 
and he slid down the wall . 
speaking of pets , i 'll tell you , my kids are older now , both of them are either in or out of college , 
and that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in length , 
i hate them . 
and finally my wife , got rid of it , because i did n't really like it . 
and my son left , went to school , 
but my son needed some money , 
so i made him a deal , 
i said , otherwise i 'm going to give it to this other man . 
that 's pretty good . 
that was sort of fun , 
i tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover . 
many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa , 
and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with his head right on her neck 
but the cat would be on the back of the sofa , 
and a dog would be running around crazy . 
and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail , 
i 'm going do n't do that , because they wo n't come in my house . 
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school , 
and it was just a small thing then , 
but it got to be pretty big , 
and you feed him small mice to big rats and things like that 
it 's just too much . 
that snake used to watch our cat walk around . 
i always told my wife your friend 's going to get our cat one of these days . 
that is wild . 
me neither . 
they need to stay outside , far away from me . 
we 're down to a simple dog and cat now , 
and that 's the way it should be , 
birds . 
they are so expensive . 
my son was just dying for a bird , 
and i 'm really allergic to them , 
so i try to stay away from them , except i 've gotten real attached to this one , 
are you ? 
and he 'd saved up his allowance and picked him out a bird in a bird cage 
i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage , 
and he has tried to bite me for two years , 
and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends . 
he talks now 
that 's neat . 
i 'm the only one that pays attention to him . 
and i 'm a substitute teacher 
we have too many pets . 
i thought , come tell me about it . 
they knew the sucker when they saw one . 
you heard the question , 
what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs ? 
i 'll tell you , 
i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on , than i do now . 
i do the easy stuff now . 
i change oil , 
and i 'll change points and do air filters , that kind of stuff . 
but i ca n't do as much as i used to , 
i used to do a whole lot more , but not any more , 
they 're just too weird to work on now . 
is that the reason you 're not doing it , 
or are you so busy you do n't have time to do it ? 
that 's part of it 
part of it is , like you said , i do n't have time . 
being a female and being alone , i do n't do anything but put gasoline , in my car , and let someone else check the oil even . 
but have you had any major repairs recently ? 
on this car i 've got now 
but i had a van before , 
and it was only two years old , 
and it had transmission go out on it . 
you should feel very fortunate . 
and i 'll declare , 
maybe i should have just traded the car in . 
sometimes it makes you wonder . 
i have a very comfortable car 
and i have a health problem that i need a large comfortable car . 
so i have a new transmission , 
and i 'm sure that any of them would have charged me almost the same amount . 
it hurts real bad . 
did you take it to a dealership ? 
i see . 
these people were recommended by a neighbor 
and that 's the only thing , 
i see . 
it 's fixed , 
it 's running , 
it 's going to run for a while yet . 
i know it . 
it certainly is frightening . 
what work are you in ? 
i work in the networking area . 
i have just retired from the southwest medical center . 
where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car , 
but they 're all too busy . 
i have to do it the other way , 
and that 's find someone and pay them to do it . 
so i certainly hope you have a nice new year . 
i 'm planning on it . 
it ca n't be any worse than last year , 
that 's for sure . 
it could be , 
but i do n't much think so . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
we 're starting out a new one , 
so let 's make it a good one . 
i 'm going to try and plan on it . 
i enjoyed the conversation . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
do you live in a home ? 
it 's a house we bought about two and a half years ago now . 
did you ? 
first house . 
we 've lived in ours for about six years . 
we had it built , actually . 
and it 's our first home , too . 
before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in , 
and that was quite an experience . 
i much prefer having my own home and , just the space and more privacy . 
is it a fairly large house ? 
that 's pretty good size . 
it 's a two story . 
it 's tiny . 
is it small ? 
it 's not much bigger . 
actually we had an two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is . 
do you have children ? 
just one . 
just one . 
but all the rooms are small , 
and . use an extra one for an office which is handy . 
i 'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one i guess . 
rather have lots of rooms and lots of space , 
but that ends up costing me . 
how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood ? . 
it 's pretty typical , 
it 's a very , very middle class neighborhood . 
i 'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood , that 's their first homes 
and lots of kids and stuff , 
and , so it fits well , in the neighborhood . 
it 's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood , 
but on the other hand , it 's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than i want . 
it seems about probably average . 
or is it ? 
but our neighborhood has just a wide variety of , people , 
and there 's older people here , and , people that are our age , 
we 're in our thirties . 
and there 's a lot of kids . 
people across the street have eight . 
eight kids ? 
their home just burned down matter of fact last summer , 
and they 're just rebuilding 
and their house is going to be really big . 
i 'm sure , with eight , 
they 're building a lot bigger . 
it 's quite different than it was before , 
and it 's a lot bigger . 
but ours is , 
it 's a nice home , 
it 's definitely not one of the smaller ones , 
and it 's not the biggest either . 
new ones they tend to be real tiny especially in newer neighborhoods , 
my brother just built a new house . 
and the neighborhood actually fought him on it , because the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood . 
and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood , 
but they were pretty touchy on it . 
he was a little surprised . 
that 's interesting you say that , because we have those architectural codes here 
we have part siding on the two story part and then on the back , 
and , there was one side where our chimney was , 
and just the chimney was going to be brick , 
and they wanted us to have more brick , 
it does look nicer , 
and we would have like to have had all brick , 
but , of course at that point we could n't afford it , 
but , it 's funny that you 'd say that , because there were homes in here that did n't have any brick at all . 
kind of depends on when they get in . 
ours is the last street that they built on . 
so the houses actually on our street they 're kind of gone a little bit nicer . 
they have , 
it 's the second phase 
and so they 've kind of changed the codes a little bit , 
and so that 's kind of why they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that did n't have any . 
and , what the builder apparently plans to do , is they do phase one , 
and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled codes and stuff , 
and then they come back in , 
do you ? 
it 's about six months old , 
we live in an apartment , 
so , we do n't have a yard , 
so it has to stay inside 
and we 're having a difficult time trying to train it . 
how old is it ? 
it 's about six months . 
but they 're supposed to be real intelligent dogs , 
. i do n't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence , really , the training bit . 
i 've had dogs through the years . 
right now i 've got two , and three cats , 
and we watched it this summer for two to three months , 
and it was n't trained quite fully either 
but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog . 
what 's the best method ? 
i do n't know . 
i 'm old fashioned , 
they say that 's not the way to do it now . 
just , put them outside unless you catch them in the act . 
we 're hardly ever at home , 
so it 's kind of difficult , 
you do n't want to do that , 
it gets frustrating when you take it outside 
and then it runs right inside 
does it just want to sniff around ? 
and it does it . ? 
does it just want to sniff around and play when it 's outside ? 
a lot of times , 
and it wo n't 
and it comes inside . 
have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside ? 
we 've tried that , 
and there 's certain spots in the house where he likes to go , 
and he chews on plants and all that , 
that 's nothing . 
it 'll catch on pretty soon , i 'll bet you . 
and she 's gone the other way , 
because she 's so old , she does n't have much control 
so we 're battling with that problem 
that 's sad . 
and she still feels good . 
but she 's got a great appetite , 
and she knows we 're there , by smell . 
how old is it ? 
that 's sad . 
and 
but we ca n't bear to do anything because she 's been our friend for all these years , 
of course not . 
so we 're putting up with all her accidents , 
i could n't . 
two nights ago , she had diarrhea , 
and so that was a bad one . 
that is really sad . 
what 's the deal , 
we 're trying to take it on walks now 
and so this dog really feels like it 's being killed or something when you try to tug on it to walk it . 
it just goes like a mad dog , 
does it . 
maybe you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes . 
we 've heard some bad things about some of those , 
they sometimes misuse their license or whatever , 
they treat them bad . 
my daughter was living at home then , 
and , it 's a pretty good class , 
she 's just pretty , 
she 's not smart . 
so , she did n't learn a lot , 
but i think it calmed her down a little bit , 
and she 's used to being around other dogs now . 
how long did it take ? 
i think it was a six week program . 
every , what ? 
i think it was one night a week for six weeks , 
and it was a group class , outside . 
it was fairly reasonable , too . 
unless they get used to something , they 're really nervous 
and if they 're not accustomed to something , they 're really scared . 
what kinds of activities do you spend with them ? 
so he spends time doing that with him , planning and practicing outside . 
he 's a real sports kind of person , 
so he plays tennis with the kids . 
we all kind of play tennis as a family , 
except the baby plays in the playground . 
we take turns with her . 
let 's see , 
we have a computer 
and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer . 
let 's . 
and my husband sometimes joins them with that . 
and i 'll take some time and do that with her . 
and even the older kids sometimes sit down and will join in and listen to a story . 
he gets home from work late or whatever 
and once in a while he 'll read the story to little one , 
but that 's basically my job . 
so do you find it difficult to find time , 
or is it pretty natural ? 
it is . 
it is hard because at the end of your day you want time for yourself 
and that 's kind of cutting into your time . 
and with the kids getting older , now on the weekends they get to the bed at ten which really is late , 
but on school nights , the two older ones get to bed about nine . 
they go upstairs at nine , 
and my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home probably not too late . 
and spend some time with him . 
but it 's really hard . 
do you work during the day ? 
i do n't work . 
that was two days a week , 
and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot . 
i do n't know how , 
but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i want it kept , it is hard . 
i can imagine . 
and that 's another thing , 
i 'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping usually on the weekend , 
and that 's kind of a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son , 
so , i try to do things like that , 
and then , of course , they have a pretty busy social calendar too . 
you fit it in with all that . 
i think it 's very , very easy to fall into that trap , 
and i 'm not totally innocent of that because , there 's times when you just stay here , watch a tape . 
that 's good . 
families are facing a challenge , 
what , 
and we 're thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years 
and it 's very hard , because when you get used to two salaries , it 's very hard to cut back to one . 
i have a friend that 's a nurse 
and she can pick her hours 
that 's a great career . 
i wish i would have gone into nursing . 
because she has such a flexible schedule , 
but it 's very hard to spend time with the children and your husband and do everything at once . 
i think it 's a big , responsibility . 
you just do n't , have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single . 
when you have children , you have to say , this is different 
and you do have to give things up . 
i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child at least for the first two years of their lives if you , can possibly swing it 
probably , once every five years . 
once every five years ? 
you have got a pretty big family . 
and that is the hardest part about getting the stuff together 
and you ? 
we have a pretty big family , 
most everybody is right in that area . 
that makes it a lot easier . a lot more convenient . 
that is why we only do it once every five or ten years . 
because it is always that hard to get everyone together . 
it was on my grandmother 's birthday , 
but she is gone now . 
that is kind of what happened with ours . 
that is why we have not had one in a long time . 
so , to make one successful what do you all do . 
do you all just start planning real far ahead of time ? 
do you all start planning real far ahead of time ? 
there is kind of a set pattern to it . 
we get together , at the park , and playground area of the church i was raised in 
and everybody brings lots of food 
eat a lot . 
it is a lot harder for us because like i said we are spread out 
and so we have to plan really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone , can start their vacation time . 
schedule vacation time 
and . 
and most people do not have more than a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back . 
so my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most . 
but , you also manage to make them . 
but we are both in school 
so that makes it kind of tough . 
they have been happening just after the summer semester starts . 
you ca n't really get away . 
usually not . 
we managed to get to one . 
that was before i started school 
and she took that summer off . 
now that we have been talking about it i am kind of getting home sick now . 
because it has been over three years since i have been home to see my grandparents . 
my grandfather is the only one that is still around . 
and my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically . 
she was like the glue , 
i understand . 
where is home for you ? 
but it is harder for everyone to get home . 
maybe this year you can find a more central location . 
but the majority of them are just like how you said in close quarters . 
the rest of them are within a couple hours drive . 
how do you all communicate ? to plan it and every thing . 
do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it , 
or do you all mail out stuff ? 
that is pretty much it . 
it is going to be such and such weekend 
and you all come . 
that is about it . 
and this is the standard pattern . 
everybody brings their favorite dish 
i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i had not seen in probably over ten years . 
it was do n't you remember me . 
and i am no . 
am i related to you ? 
i know . 
i married your cousin 's brother 's uncle or something like that . 
do you have them every year ? 
every year . 
i think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we do n't have them that often 
do you have kids ? 
i got three . 
how about yourself ? 
we have two and another one on the way . 
you have got young children then . 
we do , 
we have a six year old . 
he is oldest 
that is great . 
what kind of mix do you have ? 
a boy and a girl ? 
two boys . 
two boys . 
two boys . 
do you know what is on the way yet ? 
i am just about three months , 
and i do n't think we really even want to find out . 
i do not blame you . 
we like surprises . 
so . we will take either . 
we have got two boys and a girl also . 
we have got two boys and a girl . 
are the two boys first ? 
maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time . 
maybe , 
we kind of like our boys though too , 
he is in the navy . 
he is a lieutenant in the navy 
and the navy is sending him for his masters in ocean engineering 
he is a wildlife biologist , 
she is in the seventh grade . 
you kind of got a span there , 
she is into a little bit of everything . 
she loves riding horses 
so she goes out riding as much as she can . 
do you have horses ? 
just , she knows people that does , 
does she ? 
she must really like them . 
what they call peace group . 
i do n't know if you have gotten into that with your kids , 
it is a program for advanced kids . 
advanced . 
i have heard about it . 
our little boy is in the first grade 
and i taught school for six years . 
so , i do know about that program 
my wife is involved 
and she kind of heads that up for these kids , 
and last year they , got the state level . 
they did not win that , 
but they got one local and one region , 
and they got a new mix of kids this time . 
so , it keeps them busy . 
it keeps them busy . 
i bet . 
so does she go actually out into a different classroom with , other kids that are involved in this ? 
you probably know a peace group that they are advanced type . that they are special classes for peace classes . 
history is what their peace class is this year . 
she enjoys that kind of stuff and does well with it . 
how neat . 
so . 
challenging , 
always something to do . 
as far as our activities , we are kind of on a different level here . 
you will get to different levels . 
i guarantee it . 
my husband is going to take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight . 
that will be fun . 
both boy things . 
we do n't really ski . 
we have not taken our kids skiing or anything . 
of course , the baby is young , 
got to wait a couple years . 
sledding , that is what you have got to do . 
the what ? 
we have done that . 
in fact , he just goes right out here . 
we have got quite a bit of snow , 
last week we got a lot . 
you are welcome to keep that . 
you would like that , 
i had plenty of snow , 
it is fun really . 
it is fun . 
as long as you do not have to drive in it . 
i do not like that . 
really , it makes me nervous . 
i had plenty of snow to last me forever . 
i do n't care if i ever see any , 
i do n't care if i ever see it , 
but keep it off of here . 
i do n't mind it , 
but the winter gets long . 
i get ready , that , come about this time of year i am kind of ready for it to start getting spring , 
and , it is too early yet . 
you have got five months before you will see that . 
we do , 
we do . 
they have not been too bad . 
come about march , it gets a lot nicer . 
usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news . 
the news , 
but i do n't think of that every day , even . 
i get them from everywhere . 
we do n't get a paper 
i teach a college class 
the library has a paper . 
and so i often drop in on a break and read it . 
and i keep the radio on quite a bit when i 'm home . 
and then i figure if there 's big news , i 'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or , someone else . 
i get it from all over . 
i watch the news every day , 
we get the newspaper , and magazines , anything . 
i read a lot , 
i 'm really up on current affairs . 
i get the news and everything . 
what 's your favorite news , 
do you get a news magazine 
i 'm not getting any news magazines 
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage ? 
i do n't know . 
is there anything missing ? 
it 's kind of hard to know . 
and i do n't know , 
what are we supposed to compare it to the quality , 
whatever they tell you , 
i guess i 'm satisfied . 
they 're supposedly covering everything that happens , 
you know . 
i 've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there 's been an earthquake or sliding or something , 
i do n't ever hear it in the news here . 
it 's so slight , 
the tremors are so slight that they do n't even bother putting it in the paper . 
but most of the times i find that even if they do have tremors out there there 'll be a small article in the paper about it . 
. that 's what sells papers . 
that 's because there 's a high crime rate . 
that 's been like that since the first newspaper . 
i 'm sure . 
but i do n't know . 
i guess i 'm satisfied , 
what basis of comparison do we have really ? 
that 's true . 
we certainly get enough coverage . 
we can get news , 
sometimes you do n't even want to be bothered with the news because it 's all so bad . 
it 's all so negative . 
so . . 
we have to keep talking , i guess . 
i guess we can end . 
is it really ? 
have you always gone until the recording ? 
i guess we 're not supposed to . 
i do n't know , 
i guess we 're supposed to wait 
or i do n't know . 
was it last week , we were supposed to talk about gardening 
and it was really funny , 
i mixed it , made the call , 
and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away . 
we were laughing , i mean . 
but we do n't really do any gardening , 
so that took a minute 
and then we just talked about whatever . 
interesting . 
some topics , 
there really is n't much to say after you tell the person where they find their sources of information from 
and then if they 're satisfied , 
and that 's about it , really . 
it 's hard to talk for five minutes on this . 
you 'll hear one report 
i guess , i like to play golf . 
where do you play golf in this area ? 
that is usually where we play , 
do you ride 
or do you pull a cart when you play golf ? 
both . 
not at the same time . 
i was going to say , that could be difficult . 
sometimes we ride 
and sometimes we , pull , 
we like , to a lot of the times just walk for the exercise . 
i find that when i ride in a cart , i play better 
and i think it is cause i do n't get as tired . 
i think that might be true . 
i know , 
and that makes me so mad . 
it is not going to do that much damage to the course , 
but apparently they think differently . 
that is the reason , i do n't play over there . 
i like the course , 
but i do n't play over there because , they do n't allow you to pull a cart . 
and , i do n't think a cart damages the turf . 
a hundred dollars 
cause it is half price what the normal green fees are . 
so that is why we play over there 
cause we have got our card . 
i guess i could use a card too . 
do you ? 
right up there near the golf course . 
but next time you go check into it , 
it is just like a bus card 
and they just punch it , 
it has got one through ten on it 
and every time you go they just punch it for you . 
so i have children boy scout age . 
you must have a son . 
i have two boys that are boy scout age , 
that sounds like fun too . 
because my boys are still right at the beginning age 
and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college . 
you need to teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you . 
that 's right . 
lessons are expensive though . 
you can teach them . 
they would probably never make it then 
i only took lessons for golf when i was in college . 
but that is the only time i think i have ever really taken golf lessons 
and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual . 
i took one lesson one other time . 
besides that i just try to make the club hit the ball . 
i know what you mean . 
i do n't want to play strike out . 
but i have fun doing it , 
i have some good shots and some bad shots . 
so you said you work in the gardens too . 
do you have special flowers ? 
flower gardens . 
so , those ought to be coming up around spring time . 
she put them in two months ago cause they are winter plants . 
we thought even with all the cold weather we have had they have been blooming just fine . 
they do great . 
that is when she did , i think . 
and i do n't do anything to mine , water them or anything . 
they do really good 
and last year or the year before , i had some out 
and it froze 
but they came back later . 
i did n't do anything to them 
so they are good to plant in the winter time . 
they last for a long time then . 
so , you can put them out in the spring too , 
but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they ca n't stand the hot weather . 
do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time ? 
will they make it through the summer sun ? 
they wo n't make it through the summer because it gets too hot , 
but they make it through probably winter and spring . 
i have got some of those too , 
cause i love flowers . 
that is good . 
is it ? 
and my dad and i went out sometimes 
and it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress . 
when you have to have it , you have got to have it . 
and we figured , what the hell , 
we did it when we were kids 
and we loved it . 
of course , we did n't really rough it that much . 
he is a couple years older than me 
and he graduated and went off to college 
and during the summer we would camp out at the lake . 
i had a little boat house and floated it out on lake grapevine . 
and it was fantastic . 
we would get up in the morning , go skiing , 
that substituted for a shower 
and then we would go to work and come back to the boat house at night 
you have got four hours of day light , good skiing left . 
and it was great . 
do you have electricity out there . 
you 've got a phone obviously . 
actually as a matter of fact , they just ran the phone three years ago . 
we did n't have a phone . 
they did n't have phone lines . 
you just could n't get phones . 
and we are third from the end on the electric string . 
so , we are at the end of the mail route . 
i guess so . 
i 'm in construction 
and our truck was back . 
everything we had was in boxes 
and my wife said we 're moving . 
and i said where . 
and she said out to the trailer . 
and i said , oh . 
and i said okay . 
but it is not bad . 
it is not horrible , 
so we would go up . 
so we have kind of moved up . 
became civilized . 
a little bit in the world . 
she takes her motor home . 
but she has a lot of fun . 
she goes to dog shows . 
she shows dogs 
and you can sneak a dog into a motel 
but you ca n't sneak ten dogs into a motel . 
so , she takes the motor home . 
and she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing . 
if he would buy her a motor home . 
so he did . 
that will be pretty . 
i am going to need a vacation . 
that 's really pretty out there . 
there are a lot of nice places , 
have you painted something lately ? 
i have . 
that room i showed you . 
and then since then we have painted the bedroom . 
another bedroom . 
i showed you that one too did n't i ? 
the brown one . 
i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom . 
but i have that problem with the ceiling the blown , ceiling where you get around the edge . 
that is hard . 
how do you get the edge though ? 
how do you get the edge ? 
the straight edge ? 
you just have to be real careful . 
i see . 
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes . 
are you going to paint the outside of your house too ? 
i think i am going to do it this spring actually . 
there are six houses . 
the people that own the house they pay for anything like that , that we do . as far as the materials . 
nice . 
there are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses . 
so , i am thinking i am going to change it to something , 
i think i am going to put something like a brown on it , on the outside . and maybe , a little deeper brown in the entry way or something so it will stand out a little . 
that will be nice . 
what color did you paint , 
or two tone . . 
there are some columns that could be painted a different color too . 
what color did you paint your house ? 
white . 
but , i have a problem . 
i ca n't get up high 
and we ca n't paint the chimney . 
we are just not willing to get up that high . 
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood , he has done his house 
i was out there last week 
and he has finished everything except the chimney . 
we did too . 
we did it in the fall 
and it 's just too high . 
it is really scary , 
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional . 
but we had all this trim to paint , and lots of it . 
so , i hired this man to come in and do it . a young kid . 
what do you call those things ? 
i know what you are talking about . 
that 's it . 
he came and did it that way 
and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up . 
and if he fell , he was dead 
and he knew that . 
so that was worth it getting a professional for that . 
plus , he cleaned up my mess . 
i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney , 
it was n't too bad . 
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside ? 
since , it is a one story , 
but we did two heavy coats over it . 
but then that way you are assured you did a good job than you are if you hire someone to do it . 
but , that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to buy his paint 
and , anyway , when he checked out they only charged him for one gallon of paint . 
and he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that 
so she had to start all over again 
so that was really worth it . painting his own house . 
it was over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff . 
he really saved in that way . 
but 
i think we are going to do another bathroom , 
but i think i will probably just do it , in a roller . 
we never . 
i know . 
are you there ? 
tell me your favorite team . 
baseball ? 
i do n't follow baseball that closely , 
where do you think they 're headed , 
they 're the ones that probably are paying the highest . 
they are . 
and i think this is absolutely ridiculous . 
i 'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money . 
because he 's got one more year before he turns into a free agent . 
that 's right . 
and then who knows , 
if he produces next year , they may have to end up paying him anyway , 
but if he does n't , then his market value will go down 
and they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him the six million dollars a year this year . 
that was a great deal for him . 
i 'm sure it was . 
it was a great deal for him 
and , he just signed on , 
so he 's real happy there . 
the pitching coach ? 
i was just looking at the news tonight , 
and they showed a black guy that was helping out his assistant . 
his assistant . 
and i think that 's a great addition . 
he seemed to know what he was doing 
i really do n't . 
and i 'm not going to stand up on my , soapbox and say that , 
and i think you 're probably right , that they need some changes in pitching coach , maybe 
you do ? 
that 's contrary to popular belief . 
i know , 
i know so , 
i know . 
i understand . 
they need to have some young guys that can take the lead 
i have so many mixed emotions about all this . 
so , i guess those are the types i like . 
we 've really enjoyed them . 
where have you gone there ? 
i 've been over there too . 
where have you been ? 
let 's see , 
how neat . 
because i 've got relatives there 
and i just like it there . 
that 's neat . 
so anything in the mountains over there i just love . 
how neat . 
and i really liked it there too . 
it 's so expensive over there . 
i know , 
it 's true . 
that 's the one thing . 
it really is . 
i love to go over there , 
actually now you can get some really good deals flying over , 
once you 're there you still have to spend money . unless you know people . 
i know , 
then you can stay with them , 
and . 
that helps a lot . 
there 's a lot of places in the states that we have n't even gone . 
feel like we 've accomplished a little bit here . 
i have n't . 
and i 'd love to go to the east coast , during the fall . 
i 've always wanted to go there . 
i 've seen pictures , 
and it looks gorgeous . 
we made a trip up the east coast . 
it was in the summer 
and it really is pretty . 
it 's just gorgeous over there . 
i have n't been anywhere on the east coast . 
you 'll just have to plan a vacation some time and go over there . 
i guess so . 
but there 's a lot to see here 
and over there every time we 'd go and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we 'd always have to ask for the check 
they 're so leisurely over there 
and it 's kind of nice to have that . 
would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place , or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week ? 
usually a bunch of different places . 
probably because you want to see everything . 
see as much as you can while you 're there . 
i know . 
i liked it . 
and it 's not a place for tourists , 
they 're not used to having tourists there , 
but i liked it , 
i liked it . 
the people there are just very friendly 
what type of work ? 
i was working with an organization that does bible translation . 
find out where the languages are . 
that 's neat . 
i enjoyed it . 
my cousin came over while i was there , 
how neat . 
so , she 'd always dreamed of doing that too . 
that 's great . 
so . . 
so is there any place you would try to talk me into going to ? 
it sounds like we 've been to some of the same places . 
it does . 
did you hear our topic ? 
it 's in regards to discussing homes . 
homes , 
are you settled in a place ? 
i 'm settled in a place . 
how about yourself ? 
we were here for a few years , 
then we have come back just this summer . 
are you familiar with that ? 
it 's a nice area . 
it is . 
we 're in a temporary place right now 
so they 've enjoyed the school , 
so we 're kind of trying to stay here 
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want 
the problem we got is that we 've got five children 
and so we really want four or five bedroom house 
and everybody says how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing 
so we look at the paper , 
are you looking 
or you settled , 
we 're settled 
i 'm probably older than you , 
so i can board up their rooms , and look forward to retirement maybe . 
that empty nest syndrome is going to set in , i guess . 
but everyone has . 
seems like a nice place to go . 
we 've got five 
and the oldest is ninth grade 
and the youngest is second grade 
and i think they 're going to be with us forever . 
i do n't know if that 's true , 
we 're not anywhere near looking to cut down in size . 
i understand . 
you need very minimum four and probably five . 
in fact , six would be real good . 
my wife and i can share a bedroom . 
it 's tough to find a five and six bedroom house , is n't it ? 
i know . 
seems like you get in that category , you 're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever 
and that 's an awful lot . 
it is , 
actually , if we find something for less than a hundred and twenty thousand , we 'll be doing all right . 
but i think the thing 's out there , 
it 's just a matter of finding the right place , 
just , matter of looking , 
lot of people in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do something . 
i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school 
and there were seven kids in her family . 
and they converted the dining room and , did this and that , 
but they always seemed to get along fine . 
i think once we get into a place , it will be just fine , 
but until then , it 's , a little stressful just looking all the time and that sort of thing . 
i know 
and there 's nothing harder than that . 
i always just sort of assign my wife that chore , 
then i would let her narrow it down to three or four , 
then i 'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do . 
maybe that 's the case . 
at least she 's got more opinions , 
seems like there 's more constraints more things that she thinks about openness the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and , maybe even ignore . 
i understand that . 
. what kind of business are you in ? 
i 'm in the sporting goods business . 
i 'm a manufacturer 's rep . 
i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies . 
who are you with ? 
and we just moved down to be on staff down here 
how did that compare with this area as far as housing prices ? 
we were really surprised to find that they 're higher here . , 
and then to come down here , we thought things would be lower , 
and they 're not . 
i spent four years as a university professor . 
i spent three years , 
i 'm teaching in public schools and elementary school . 
do you really ? 
that 's great . 
i did . 
i did , 
you sound pretty young for a university professor . 
i was pretty young . 
i had never intended to do it 
at any rate the topic is fascinating because one of the things i 've done for the past few years is research the problem from the point of view of what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically . 
you may be familiar with cooperative learning . 
the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools . 
and what it involves , basically , is the use of peer groups 
and the teacher becomes a sort of a resource person to the learning cooperatives , . 
and there are some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people gain a competence with respect to the material . 
i think that the combination of technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn . 
i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster . 
school systems are , in too many states , dominated by administrators 
and both teachers and parents complain about the cost and ineffectiveness that results . 
and i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance , particularly accelerate the pace of learning . 
and , my feeling is that those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually . 
i do n't know what form it will ultimately take . 
but , i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we 're paying an enormous price for inferior quality when the people involved really are n't inferior , 
i see what year saying , 
i totally agree . 
you must see kids with real significant problems in some cases . 
is it , deteriorated a lot . 
are they pretty happy with it , 
and people there were saying that the way that the schools were going , a lot of people were going away and going to private schools , or else going to , where they taught their kids at home . or anything but the public schools and the ones that did have the kids , 
maybe it was the area i was in , 
but a lot of schools had a lot of transient families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side 
so , you saw a fair number of troubled kids . 
you said , how the schools are doing more things for the kids than they were thirty years ago . 
the school i was teaching at , the year i left , they were considering providing hot breakfast for the kids . 
as well as hot lunch 
i suppose we both have credit cards . 
they seem to be a part of life . 
how do you use them ? 
i do use them . 
i have a few favorites that i use more than others 
and i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable . 
i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to . 
but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few 
and they all can build up . 
i think they 're handy . 
i do n't carry a lot of cash with me 
and i hate writing checks when you go shopping . 
do you use credit cards ? 
i use a few . 
i watched my grandmother go into debt on them 
grandmother 
so my mother learned from that 
and i guess she taught me to be very , very careful with them . 
so basically i just keep them , 
i use them so that i build up a credit rating . 
i 've just been married seven months , 
but he has the same habit 
and we just keep a few of the major ones , and then use them once in a while for something , 
that 's good . 
but we always pay it off right that month so that we do n't pay any service charge . 
that 's wonderful . 
so that way we keep out of debt 
and we keep on top of what we 're spending . 
the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what your savings is bringing . 
it 's really ridiculous to let them keep building . 
that 's what i feel . 
but i know some people can get , carried away with them and let them get out of hand . 
it 's really easy , just to forget that you charged that or charged that . 
but sometimes i forget 
and so a bill will come in 
and i 'll think , i did n't know it was going to be that high . 
but so far , we 've been able to pay it off every time 
that 's good . 
right now i 'm kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate . 
it seems that some of them have gotten higher 
and i did n't write it down at the time 
and then i went and looked to see what my visa was 
so , think i want to find something that has a lower rate . 
have you ever used discover card ? 
i have n't . 
i 'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off 
i have n't found many places that do n't take discover . 
and there 's no annual service fee , which is good . 
and then they also give you cash back at the end of the year . 
for the amount that i charge , i get two dollars back or something 
but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back . 
they give you money back for using your credit card . 
basically . 
that 's it . 
i did n't know that . 
and i think the service charge is pretty low , too , 
but , i 'm not sure . 
so now they 'll take the discover , 
but i never did apply for a discover card . 
i can do enough damage with those two . 
i think it 's best to keep the number down that you have . 
i 've got some that i have n't even used at all past few years 
i probably would n't be able to use them . 
i have to admit that 's one of my favorite places to shop . 
do you have anything else to say ? 
not too much more about credit cards . 
i do n't think i do either 
it was good talking to you . 
good luck . 
have a good evening . 
you , too . 
as far as i 'm concerned it 's probably apt that your call 's at this time because we just got through watching reasonable doubts . which had a capital case in it . 
my own feelings about capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony . 
i do , too . 
mandatory summary execution , on the steps , that day . 
i think that person is beyond rehabilitation 
and he should be taken out . 
but , i do know that almost all people usually die before that point . 
they just get too old . 
as far as capital punishment , on it 's own merits , i have the trouble with the way it 's applied . 
i think it should be applied , on a little bit more fair manner . 
and i 've said this very often 
and i believe it to be a very true axiom , 
so i would rather be white , rich and guilty than black and innocent . because if you 're black and you kill a white guy , you 're going to fry . 
they will kill you . 
and if you 're black and you kill a black guy it 's two hundred hours of community service . 
you do n't hear too much of those cases . 
we 're the majority , 
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do . 
that 's right . 
and you 're the minority 
and you 're stuck with it . 
the handwriting 's on the wall there , is n't it ? 
it sure is . 
but that 's another issue altogether . 
as far as capital punishment , i think that ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment . 
the only thing i do n't understand , i guess i do n't understand our judicial system as it is right now 
because if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death , how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution ? 
you were assumed guilty until proven innocent 
and once they found you guilty judge said , he 's guilty , 
kill him . 
there were some people that had a problem with that . because they found out later on that a guy will lie rather than get killed . 
and he 'll say that guy did it not me . 
or he 'll have somebody lie for him . 
people lie , 
it 's a strange thing , 
but they do that , 
look at that guy at e systems . 
they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit . 
he was too far away when it happened . 
they were n't dope dealers , 
they were employees of an establishment that had a very high level of security sense , too . 
and these were really responsible people . 
and they convicted this guy because somebody says , he looks like the right guy . 
they all look the same to me . 
big lips , flat nose , 
that was him . 
did you watch the bulls this morning ? 
you know what , 
i watched a little bit of the bulls game 
and i had to leave . 
in fact i think the bulls were ahead when i left . 
who won the game ? 
they won by two points . 
is that right ? 
they were behind as they headed into each quarter 
and then they came back in the second half 
and at the end , i think they looked like they were closing it out 
and i think the bulls won by two . 
do n't they have the best record now ? 
i think they do , as a matter of fact . 
they looked real good 
they do , 
they 're balancing their attack 
i know , 
i saw the second half of the game last night 
and they were impressive . 
they look good . 
that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him . 
good move . 
he 's really worked out well . 
the warriors have got a team , 
and i think that will be real interesting to see what they can do . 
they 're ahead , 
and i do n't know , 
in the east , i do n't know , 
i have n't kept up with any of the other teams . 
they 've had a hard time . 
but just this whole year has been just disastrous for them 
and i think they 're going for an all time record of how many losses in a row they can , pull out . 
it 's unbelievable . 
not a whole lot , 
you find them to be pretty loyal with the local teams . 
it 's true , 
really is n't , 
is it ? 
so it 's not something you 'd drive , 
and they have got a great club . 
they 've done a good job . 
of course , drafting a franchise like him certainly , 
that always makes a big difference . 
i think that 's the way it works now in basketball . 
and i used to think that one player really does n't make a club , 
but it really does . 
you get somebody like magic 
and you can see the decline in that team . 
once he left it 's not the same team . 
there 's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for . 
i think you 're right 
and i think those things do make a difference 
i do n't know who would meet them in the west . 
i watched only a few minutes of it 
and i was n't paying attention . 
and so i do n't know , 
that 's something i 've thought a lot about . 
i work in a hospital . 
and i 've taken care of a few aids patients . 
when they asked us did we want to keep it the same or spend more , spend less i think right now what they 're spending is adequate . for my personal opinion . because i think it 's something that 's going to take them a while to come up with a vaccine for . 
i do n't think it 's going to be that easy to come up with 
or i think they already would have by now . 
so i do n't know if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now . 
i think they 're doing as much research as they can possibly do . 
and what about you ? 
i guess i 'm not too aware of how much they 're spending right now . 
i 'm not either . 
i 'm definitely not aware of how much . 
that 's something i 've never really kept up with at all . 
i 'm not sure , 
go ahead . 
i know i 've always thought more about the disease rather than the research , 
you know what i mean ? 
and that sort of thing . 
if we were talking about the money i 'd just have to say what they 're spending is probably enough , simply because i do n't know that much about it . 
i can see that research is needed 
definitely . 
i think so , 
i think so . 
it 's becoming a major problem . 
that 's true . 
and i feel like just saying , safe sex is not the answer . 
it 's , abstinence in certain cases 
it 's definitely not . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
myself i 'm about to , get a divorce 
and course , i 'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything . 
but , it 's sort of scary to find yourself single again . 
and because you never know what 's going to happen . 
you do n't know who you 're going to come across . 
course , i 'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody i see . 
but it 's something you got to think about these days . 
a single person , 
and it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry . 
i think for a lot of people it has . 
certainly . 
drug addicts . 
and i do n't know , 
i do n't think that 's a bad idea . 
i know it sort of does n't address the problem of drug addiction . 
it just sort of keeps that going . 
but i do n't know , 
at least drug addiction can be treated whereas aids , so far , can not be , 
so , i do n't know , 
i do n't know , 
what do you think about that ? 
that 's a hard issue . 
it really is . 
it really is . 
it really is . 
they gave us a hard topic . 
i definitely think that it 's the drug problem that needs to be addressed , 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
i guess if you consider the two problems , drug addiction and aids aids would have to come first as far as something to do about it . 
so i do n't know . 
course , there 's so many things in the world where , if you solve one problem , you may be creating another . 
so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse . which is the most important to solve at the time 
i do n't know . 
but i 've never looked into how much money they 're spending . 
i have no idea . 
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that . 
but i really have never looked into it . 
i have no idea . 
i have n't either . 
i 've heard different voices speaking up and saying we 're not spending enough 
and , mostly that 's what i 've heard , 
so i do n't know , 
and , yet , i know it sounds like big money to me . 
but it probably takes a lot . 
i think it is . 
i think it is . 
it seems to take more than for any little thing they do , 
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would . 
did you have any fear working in the hospital with that , 
that 's one thing i 've never really feared . 
a lot of my family they fear me working like that and , under some of those conditions , 
but i do n't fear it at all . 
i work in the operating room a lot 
or is that a crime free zone there ? 
i do n't think there is any such thing , as a crime free zone any longer . 
i 'm afraid you 're right . 
and they had stopped a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge 
and then the other one was on the roof in the back . 
by your house ? 
on my house . 
so i 'm very much aware of crime in the cities and the concern about it . 
that 's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening . 
it was . 
and so i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage , 
so i got my gun and walked through the house into the garage . 
there was no one there , 
but i wanted to be sure . 
unfortunately . 
that 's too bad . 
and now you can tell the change , for sure . 
that could n't be too far from you , neither . 
it 's farther west of me . 
i live over near white rock lake . 
i never thought about someone robbing those , 
but , apparently , they do . 
i do n't know how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody 
it just does n't seem possible , does it . 
it 's kind of stupid , is n't it . 
but i guess when people do those things , they do n't really give a thought of the consequences at the time . 
and away you go . 
and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in the theft and the violence that we see . 
i think you 're right although i think that may be an excuse for people , too . 
it is convenient , is n't it ? 
i did n't know what i was doing . 
that kind . 
just like the old alcohol idea 
where do you work ? 
i think i do . 
that 's a pretty rough area there , is n't it ? 
it is a pretty rough area . 
we 're over by fair park . 
and you watch the people . 
and the kids see that 
definitely that area , that 's big time . 
big time there , 
sure is . 
it surely is . 
i 'm careful . 
that 's the worst neighborhood in the whole area . 
it 's a little scary sometimes 
you probably more up on this subject than i am , 
but , the roles that women have played in the last couple of generations . 
they 've entered the work force more since world war two is when they started . 
you bet . 
and i think that that is very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women . 
you bet . 
i 'm a traveling salesperson 
and i have traveled most of my life 
and i know just especially in the last ten years and really in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling . 
i sell sporting goods 
and even in our industry there was really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell 
and even in the last five or six years we see more and more women being involved 
and it 's a credit to them as far as how they 're doing things . 
you see more of them , leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel , too . 
you bet . 
one of the girls travels quite extensively 
and she says , my children have two parents . 
why not . 
you bet . 
that 's sort of neat . 
so i think that 's a change 
and i think that 's a change you 're going to be seeing more of in the future , people having that kind of attitude that the father 's going to take more active role in child rearing . 
i think it 's the age old thing , 
and they 're carrying the same job responsibility 
and that 's a very true statement 
and it should n't be that way . 
that will change in the near future also . 
i hope so , 
it 's been changing , 
it 's been evolving , 
but there 's still an inequality in the work forces or jobs . 
and you hear some people say he 's a man , 
he needs that salary . 
they forget . 
also , i think a good argument for that is in the area of politics , 
a woman congressman makes as much as a man congressman and the same as a senator or whatever . 
so they certainly deserve it all the way . 
but , i guess just the most significant thing changed for me , again , as i mentioned , was just in traveling , 
and going , 
and i expect you 're right in regards to having two parents now . 
that 's a good statement . 
i think it will be . 
another thing i read , too , the other day is the car designers are starting to design cars with women in mind . 
the man is looking in the engine 
and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel . can her makeup come off the upholstery . 
you bet . 
good point . 
and if they 're out there buying that many cars , then there 's that many out that are self sufficient and mobile and working . 
right now i 'm self employed 
and my wife 's always worked . 
she 's a schoolteacher , 
she started working 
she was selling real estate at the time 
and hers was the only income we had for three or four months 
she certainly did her part in 
and she still works everyday 
we all do . 
you bet . 
i just happen to be off today . 
i work , too . 
enjoying it . 
what kind of work do you do ? 
i 'm a nurse . 
married ? 
trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject . 
i do n't know , 
i 'm kind of out of things . 
you see the old cigarette ads about you 've come a long way . 
you 've come a long way baby ? 
baby , 
you think about this when it comes to a subject like that 
and it 's really true . 
women have come a long way 
so you have a child two years old in child care right now . 
two year old daughter in child care 
and we went through the process of searching for child care and finding what we consider to be , real good child care at a pretty reasonable price . 
how about you , 
do you have any children ? 
our first 
and he just turned three months . 
so , we 're just starting into hunting for child care . 
right now , both of us are students . 
are you ? 
where are ? 
are you going to put your son in child care in a year or two ? 
probably . 
actually spring semester a year from now he 's going to have to be in child care five days a week more than likely . depending on how my class schedule runs 
so , depending on what my class schedule looks like , he may spend anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point . 
right now we 're trying to avoid it , 
but we just , as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a girl to watch him . 
i get out of class at certain time 
and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class . 
once a day this overlap happens where we ca n't , one of us be home . 
that 's a good experience , i think , 
and there are a lot of things to think about 
and the articles that are written on the topic , are pretty good 
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative 
and that 's more important than anything else . 
we could have sent her to a fancier facility . 
she goes to a home . 
this is a couple emigrated from china early in their lives . 
they 've got three daughters . 
and they 're both there 
and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon . 
and our daughter is healthy , happy , well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends , 
so it 's a good experience . 
that makes a big difference . 
if it 's good , i think it 's very good for the child . 
and , and that 's really what we 've learned about it . 
she 'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year 
but we feel real fortunate 
and we were able to just choose in the marketplace . 
there 's a lot of child care available , 
but invariably there 's waiting lists . 
i 'll bet they 're involved . 
and their people staff the child care center just off campus . 
but they have a pretty good size waiting list . 
i know it 's a real hard thing to do , even for people in , university communities . 
and there is quite a waiting list to get into that . 
so it 's an important , decision , 
and i think this really is buyer beware . 
it 's best , 
it is the best way to do it , interestingly . 
i think that my own interest in human development leads me to believe that that 's a good sign and that private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn . 
because , i think what we 're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market . 
primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life . 
it 's phenomenal . 
it 's phenomenal , the human operating system , 
credit cards . 
i 'll tell you what , 
i ca n't say a whole lot about credit cards because i tore mine up . 
is that right ? 
i know some other people that have done that . 
i got in some financial problems because of credit cards 
so i basically just got rid of all of them . 
i have a couple . 
we have some friends that did exactly the same thing . 
and they just cut them all up except for one they kept for emergencies 
and they 're still paying away to get out of debt . 
i know it . 
but 
i did just the opposite . 
i guess i sort of followed in my parents ' footsteps . 
i have quite a few of them . 
i use them continually , 
but i basically never charge anything i do n't have the money in the bank to pay for . 
and i always pay them off totally every month . 
is that right ? 
that 's a good policy . 
and they 're just a convenience for me . 
i do n't have to get cash out of the bank , 
and i do n't have to be writing checks 
sometimes i wish i had them , 
but in most cases , i 'm glad i do n't because unfortunately i do n't have the control you have . 
i wish i did , 
but i do n't . 
i just do n't want to get into that situation again , 
it 's easy , 
you do n't have anything transferring , just a little signature , 
so what . 
that 's it . 
even with my gas card i find that i 'll go in to get some gas 
and i 'll end up buying candy and drinks and sweets and whatever , 
and then at the end of the month i get a bill 
and i 'm thinking what did i get , that costs so much . 
surprising . 
there are some inherent limits there , 
you 're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that , 
that 's true , 
the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really not so much discipline , 
you have sort of a discipline in general about finances , 
is n't it , 
that 's unbelievable . 
let me ask you this . 
, how old are you ? 
excuse me . 
it 's coming . 
i know what you mean about the interest rates . 
it 's unbelievable . 
that just irritates me so much that i refuse to pay them interest 
and , she 's from there and , did n't really have the money , 
but she could pay it off , 
and so i , sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards , 
but she 's paying it , 
and i just wo n't do it . 
and i just refuse to give it to them . 
if i need to borrow that kind of money , i 'll go to the bank 
and then , you bet . 
in fact , i 've even heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less rates and have paid off their higher interest rate cards and just sent them back . 
income . 
and i guess there 's some negotiating there , too , 
if you 've got a pretty good credit rating you can call wherever you got your card from and tell them , either drop my rates or drop my annual fees 
or i 'll just go to somewhere else . 
and if you 've got a pretty good history with them they 're more than willing to do that . 
i might try that because i have one card that i 've had for about nine or ten years . 
he wrote a book on it 
and he says he 's tried it with several of his cards 
and he 's just told them i can get this card from this bank at this rate 
it does not make sense for me to do that 
and if you wo n't drop my rates , i 'll just go ahead and send you back your card 
and i 'll go somewhere else and get it . 
for me the big thing is the annual fee 
and i just refuse , 
i wo n't get any card now , 
i 've got a good rating 
and i 'm not going to pay an annual fee . 
this is an unusual topic . 
what do you think about it ? 
it took eight times to find you 
what should i say 
and then he reminded me , 
and so they just notify everyone by mail , 
and then they just meet at a park or something to have a small , dinner type thing . 
how far away do they come from ? 
and sometimes we 've gone 
and his dad 's family is all around the area 
and each time they had a reunion they 'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody . 
that makes sense . 
nobody 's out of a lot of trouble more than once . 
and that person can call beforehand and just make sure everyone knows , too . 
and then they just sort of do a little program or something like that so that everyone 's sort of involved . 
that 's interesting . 
you sound like you 've had a lot of experience with this , then . 
that 's my husband 's side 
so we just have to either or , give a formal invite 
and we 're all there 
l a , orange county area . 
everyone 's mostly not farther than an hour away . 
i see . 
my experience has been limited pretty much lately to my mother 's side of the family . 
years ago there was a big dispute on my dad 's side 
and they have n't had a reunion since then . 
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that , 
but my mother 's side we had our first real reunion that i 've ever gone to last summer 
and they had people come in from out of town 
and they had some activity , 
they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff 
and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree 
and a lot of that sort of thing . 
since it was the first one that we 'd had you could do that once . 
next time we have one , we 'll have to think of something more creative to do . 
and inevitably everyone is just very interested 
and they always have two or three new ones to add to the list , 
someone 's been born 
or someone passed away 
or something like that 
and so everyone has to update their little books or whatever . 
i do , but not very much compared to my mother-in-law . 
not a passion . 
and i suspect we will do more of it . 
i found out about some of the relatives 
and there 's a lot of things there you have to stop , 
they 're really kind of fascinating . 
i found out my grandmother was one of a twin . 
we have virtually no background on the twin . 
i 'm sure she 's dead now , because my grandmother died about twenty years ago . 
i see . 
i 'm probably a lot older than you are . 
maybe they just moved away and then sort of lost contact . 
i do n't know . 
how you doing ? 
fine . 
let me ask you something , 
can i run a minute and shut my radio off ? 
where are you calling from 
or where are you at ? 
not all good stuff . 
are you involved in any of that ? 
i 'm not personally . 
do you work ? 
i 'm going to school right now . 
you are ? 
i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband 's or what i think . 
because i work for myself 
and so there 's a lot that i guess i do miss a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation . 
i miss insurance and the steady paychecks that come . 
i 'm selling in out now to go to school full time 
and i enjoyed the freedom of having that , 
is that right ? 
go to work when i wanted to or not 
but the benefits were n't there . 
i own part of a roofing company . 
do you ? 
and unfortunately we were part of a bigger company 
and we had all the benefits there 
and i do miss that , 
but on the other hand i enjoy having the time that i have with my family and being able to work when i want 
because my husband gets , his medical through his company , 
but we have to pay for mine 
and i 'm the only one that 's being insured 
and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children has , 
is that right ? 
and the way medical expenses are i think that 's probably one of the biggest benefits you need to have . 
i 'll tell you what , 
that is the single most benefit that i enjoyed , and i do miss 
because i looked into picking up some medical insurance just for my family just , 
and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it . 
it 's out of sight . 
it 's out of sight . 
even at a group rate . 
it 's unbelievable 
and the amount that you have to pay for kids 
and if you want to add dental to it that eats even more . 
it goes up . 
i guess the other benefits that i miss is some of the bonuses and stuff that goes on with just being involved with a big company 
and i 'm sure it will be quite a few people are affected by that 
it 's going to hurt the city , 
although i will personally tell you , i used to work at a bank , 
they were paid that whole time 
they come in there , 
and i 'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week 
is that right ? 
i really believe they have done this to themselves , in a way , because of the unions being so stocked . 
the union , 
i just read this in the paper the other day . 
is that right ? 
plus probably an additional six months through the worker 's stuff that they have through the company 
so i 'm sorry it 's happening because it 's going to hurt , 
but i do n't feel as sorry for them , 
if my husband were laid off tomorrow , we 'd get one more check 
and that would be it . 
really the ones it 's going to hurt is actually the businesses around in that area . 
that 's already hurting . 
that 's the ones that that 's going to hurt because they depend on that , 
they voted them in 
and they got so good like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical , all these things 
and it made the prices of cars go up 
i believe in unions , 
but they went too far . 
i 'll tell you , 
i 've had my fill of unions . 
and i got married there 
and we stayed there for a while , 
and they have a way of dragging you back home . 
and i do water color , 
and i do fabric painting . 
you do a lot then . 
how about you ? 
but i do n't know , 
somehow i do n't have the time anymore . 
but i have all these friends that wherever you go , they sit down and the next thing you know , they pull out of their bags their most recent needle craft 
those take a lot of time . 
i only can do things that are pretty fast , because we just got our baby last year , 
and i just do n't have the patience to just do something . 
is this your first baby ? 
that 's the only thing , 
and i did a quilt , 
let 's see , 
i 've done a quilt for our baby 
and i 've done a quilt for our bed , 
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself , 
or how did you make a quilt ? 
our baby 's quilt , it was like the design , 
i just went around the design in the quilt . 
i did n't piece it or anything like that 
did you need a loom , 
was it small enough that you could just hold it ? 
are you familiar with that ? 
i was always amazed . 
i have one of them . , 
i have n't done tons of them . 
but i used to do more before we got our baby , 
and they 'll wear them . 
once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them . 
and then i paint around it 
does that make sense to you ? 
i think it 's very clever . 
and they were matching 
and they were lovely , 
but when i washed them , although i took the precaution of turning them inside out truly , everything fell off , or most of it . 
so i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back 
so i 'm familiar with that , 
someone told me that they had done it both ways , 
what are your favorite shows ? 
did you see it the other night ? 
that was pretty good . 
that one was . 
with the psychic and everything ? 
i like northern exposure and home improvement . 
i have n't seen either of those . 
you 've never seen northern exposure ? 
it 's a great show . 
but it 's on so late here , that i do n't always get to see it . 
we like it , too . 
have you seen the movie ? 
i have n't seen any of the movies because i just barely , just in the last year or so got interested in it , 
and they 're already out with number six by now , 
so i have n't seen any of the movies , yet , 
you have n't seen any of them . 
they 're good , 
they 're real good . 
they 're getting rid of the old cast for the movies , though . 
which ones are you watching , 
the new ones ? 
i 've seen quite a few of the older ones . 
i have n't seen really the new generation that much . 
is there one you prefer better , 
the older one or the newer one ? 
they 're a lot different . 
but , i like the older ones because at that time they were really futuristic . 
and i guess the newer ones are real futuristic , too , 
but i like both of them . 
i do too . 
he almost hates the new ones . 
because he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one is n't or something , 
but , i do n't . 
not really . 
it 's not really like a soap opera , 
but that 's true , 
you learn more about the characters and stuff , 
but that 's the way all shows are now . 
let 's see . 
he does n't even try to let the person know he 's getting onto them . 
the same ones over and over , though like that one where he goes to college , 
or is there a series on . 
there 's one on , 
this last time it was about this movie director , 
i saw that one . 
did you see that ? 
i do n't know if that 's the movie of the week or what , 
but it seems like there 's only about four or five different ones , 
and then they keep showing them over and over . 
i guess i have n't seen it before . 
he was a movie director , 
on the set or something . 
that was pretty good though . 
it was . 
but 
i do n't think so . 
but i 'm never home 
and i ca n't remember what it is . 
i used to watch twin peaks . 
you never saw that ? 
i 've heard of it a lot , 
i 've heard of , a lot of people somehow or something . 
they 'll say , so and so from twin peaks , or something . 
that was a different soap opera . 
but , it was a different type of show . 
i did n't like the way it ended , though . 
did they end the whole series ? 
they only did it for two years . 
but it 's all over now . 
do you also ? 
you ready to begin ? 
we might as well . 
i understand we are doing care of the elderly ? 
and how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home ? 
i do n't think that any of my relatives would really like to go there . 
i believe , if i , am in a position when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that i will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also or have someone go into their home and look after them . 
it 's more how they feel about it . 
and it is like they feel like somebody had thrown them away ? 
but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference . 
and i have a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who could care for her . 
i use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home 
and i got to see a lot of the things that they did 
and they had a lot of games 
they do all sorts of things 
some of the people that are in there are very nice and friendly to everybody 
it is just a job 
and they just want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home . 
the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important . 
i think it would matter too kinds of disabilities that the nursing home accepts . because there are some who poor things do n't have any real grasp on reality any longer . 
and they may be ambulatory , 
but they tend to behave like small children 
and that would be very difficult for an adult who was n't in that situation to have to deal with on a daily basis . 
they would just roll themselves around all over the place 
and they would enjoy themselves with activities 
and then you would see some of the others that were distant from the other group 
and they just did n't participate together with the others because they had some , slight mental disabilities and things like that . 
and they were n't really together with the rest of them , when they got together for such activities . 
what are your opinions on recycling ? 
i definitely think that we need to start recycling . 
i think if we wait which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it is going to be to late . 
i have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand . 
i have heard that too . 
and that is not too far away , 
but i do n't know how it is there . 
it is very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much . 
i take , my paper , 
i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store 
and there are some fire stations i can take newspapers to 
and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile . 
i started saving newspapers 
and i would take a ton of them 
i ca n't remember where i went to take them , 
but they would n't take them . 
it is real hard to find a spot 
and then , i do n't know if you note , even doing that , the amount of trash we throw away is incredible 
bottles 
i know . 
glass 
it could be recycled , 
there is no really recycling facilities . 
i think that is a good idea . 
besides a law or whatever . 
i think so , 
just because they have to , 
and you get ticketed if you do n't do it right . 
it 's trouble for me to do what i do 
i am willing to do it 
plus you have to have a place to store all of it 
and i live in an apartment . 
it is very difficult . 
our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers 
and , so , i do n't know . 
i think there needs to be more places 
and also i have a real strong opinion . 
every time you buy a container , no matter what it is , whether it is glass , whether it 's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever , you pay ten cents for it 
and then you take it back to the store 
and you get it back . 
you are forced to . 
and you also do n't see the litter there . 
that 's true . 
it makes it worthwhile to take it back 
i do n't know if you 've tried it 
i have seen them . 
that take them back . 
some of them are five , 
some are ten cents . 
i am looking at it right now . 
so , i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass . 
i do n't think that there is enough being done . 
and we have a paper recycling program that is company wide 
and i do the recycling for that . 
do they save the paper they use at the office . 
because there is a lot of waste there is n't there . 
and i know there is a lot of computer paper that you ca n't use . 
i do n't even remember the money that they 've made from the recycling program . 
they have donated it to charities . 
they have made a substantial amount of money from it . 
i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later , 
and i want them to have my business . 
and i think packaging could be done much better . 
there is so much plastic . 
i know , 
you see some of the stuff 
and then when they come out with the new things , you are why did n't you think of that before . 
and i think that it 's just people have got to be aware . 
unfortunately , there are a lot of people that just do n't care 
and they do n't want to think about it . 
that 's true . 
and i just look at it , i do n't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why did n't you do something . 
i want to feel like i at least tried . 
and i do n't know . 
it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it . 
then we will be forced to . 
it may be too late . 
very little . 
then , that 's pollution . 
that does n't do me any good because i do n't have any place to burn it . 
i know . 
i guess you run into the pollution factor . 
and there is no place i can take glass to . 
so , i still throw away a lot of glass . 
it is really sad . 
you buy some 
it depends upon our weather here , 
today was a beautiful day 
it was like summer day . 
so i dressed in a light weight skirt , 
because i had some appointments at the office today , some interviews 
and so i had to dress up anyway 
and then i wore heels . 
how do you dress ? 
i 'm going to talk about when i was working as a teacher and when i was working . 
and i wore heels anyway . 
i 've been a teacher 
so has my daughter 
i know , 
it might kill you to go up and , walk up to the door 
that 's right . 
but you 're going to look nice for the kids . 
that 's right 
and it always makes you feel like you 're a bigger person than the kids ? 
i need all the height i can get . 
i do too . 
so to be taller than some of the boys in the older grades , i had to wear heels . 
if it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots 
but then i would change into heels , as soon as i got to my desk . 
it has a heel on it . 
they 're the kind of boots that i wear to work 
and we wear them , 
they 're a leather boot that you wear 
and as i said they have a regular heel on them , high heel . 
and we wear them a lot with shirts and things . 
they 're not a cowboy boot , 
but they 're just a real pretty boot , 
of course , you probably wear coats a lot . 
the first two years i was in a room where they did n't heat it . 
so i did , 
so then you had to . 
and then the third year we got heating 
so it was nice . 
then things improved , 
but of course , here we wear a light weight jacket a lot , 
that 's nice . 
and that 's very seldom 
it depends upon our winter . 
we have a few days you might wear a winter coat , , 
but most of the time you can wear a sweater 
and we just do n't wear coats much . 
we often laugh about even when it turns chilly . 
we 're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we 're so used to running around like that . 
it 's really different . 
let 's put it that way . 
are you not teaching anymore ? 
and i 'm working at a day care right now . 
i see . 
and so the way i dress is really different because i 'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to twenty months . 
so you do n't wear heels anymore i 'll bet . 
more practical . 
it does n't matter if i have to wash it a hundred times or something . 
but i never wore jeans because i thought that was too casual . 
it 's all right for the students , 
but i did n't think teachers should . 
that 's how i feel too . 
there 's some good things about it 
but i 've seen . a lot of things i 'm not used to yet , 
where did you live before ? 
i guess we 're forced finally , to do a lot about air pollution . 
one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from ? or sources . 
i assume , that the major sources are cars and factories . 
that 's what , i would think . 
but i do n't know for sure . 
comes over the border from us . 
i think the automobile definitely is an area and any industry that burns , 
and then i do n't know about chemical pollution . 
i 'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air . 
i know we have a lot of the indoor type pollution . 
they have offices that are too well insulated . 
they found people are getting sick , 
but i do n't know if that affects outside . 
seems to me that 's what they were asking about was outside 
and the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories . 
i guess there 's been a lot of pressure to do away with the c f c 's in these spray bottles which , has been a real problem . 
that 's destroying the ozone , is n't it ? 
again that 's what i hear 
and there 's this big debate apparently about whether there 's a hole in the ozone or not 
but at last i heard it was discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought , initially . 
it 's kind of scary . 
it is scary 
and i think it will continue to force us to clean up our act , literally and figuratively . 
we 've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment . 
i think something too that you probably see in older states , is where people will use their fireplaces . 
i 'm wondering whether it 's going to get to the point where you ca n't , do that . 
i think it will . 
and , it 's not too bad around here although you see it more and more in the sky . 
and people in this country are really wedded to their cars , 
and this is one of the big problems , 
we have to drive so far , 
but we 're even getting it here . 
and you can tell it in the mornings too . 
and there 's just a brown fog here 
and we do n't even have any mountains that are , holding it in . 
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together , the worse it gets . 
that makes a lot of sense . 
i had n't thought about it that way 
you do n't have to have mountains that are stopping it . 
so 
we can comment 
and we did n't see this a few years ago . 
it was pretty clear here . 
and we 're going to feel it , 
and i think it 's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy , in this country whether people are willing to get out of their cars , 
and in this country the solution that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable . 
and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive 
but i think we 're going to have to make some fundamental changes 
and i 'm not sure how long it 's going to take or what it 's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and , houses we sell . 
and it 's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car , just one person in that . 
it 's a lot of waste 
do you have any elderly relatives currently in an nursing home now ? 
i do . 
do you ? 
i have a grandmother . 
she 's a hundred and two . 
she 'll be a hundred and three in august . 
and we decide not to put her in a nursing home . 
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town 
and then my sister takes care of her . 
she still has her snap . 
she takes care of her own business . 
i have seen my family age . 
she 's been there ten years now . 
and i have seen them age twenty in the time and with the expense and everything , 
i still think it is worth it if you had a good nursing home 
and they needed some quality care , 
i would put someone in a nursing home . 
they had to make a family decision . 
there 's seven children in my husband 's family 
but they were very fortunate . 
it 's a small town 
and she happens to room with one of the doctor 's mothers 
and then she 's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time 
that 's good . 
nobody thought she would adjust , 
that is great . 
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick 
she 's been taking care of him . 
i do n't know how much longer this can last 
he ca n't do anything without her . 
he does n't know when to take his medicine 
and it 's really sad 
my brothers are not interested in helping me 
so i would have to move him down here . 
i want to see the nursing home . if i have to put him into one . 
where i can go see it . 
they have apartment styles , 
but that would n't work for him . 
i think he is beyond that . 
where if you need help you can get it , 
but basically people kind of have a small apartment 
and doctors are available if they need them . 
the only problem with these are that they are very expensive . 
and the bad thing about it , before you can get any kind of government help you have to be a pauper . 
it takes every penny . 
and that 's the sad part about it . 
i talked to my mother . 
and my mother could make it on that . 
and then i would send it back to her 
so that 's what would happen . 
i think that 's what most people do . 
you just have to give everything away . 
it 's unfortunate . 
i work at a brokerage firm 
it 's frightening . 
and i guess i do n't know how old you are . 
we 're the generation moving into this 
and i do n't know how our kids are going to take care of us . 
i ca n't imagine . 
we do n't have any children . 
everybody that has , has them later in life . 
my mother and my father are in their late sixties . 
so they 're not that far away . 
i also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise 
and he 's still living at home 
and i do n't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are . 
i know . 
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations , 
but something will have to change as more and more of us get older . 
but . 
most people are n't . 
most are n't . 
that 's the problem . 
and that 's the bad thing . 
i would hate to have lived so long . 
she lived by herself . 
my grandfather passed away before i was born 
that 's incredible . 
do you want to go ahead 
and they are really big on women 's rights . and equal treatment . 
and so i 've seen a lot of rallies and things like that . 
but i 'm not that liberated . 
my mom is kind of old-fashioned . 
so , you pick up some traits from her and stuff . 
but i think it 's interesting and better for women to see that there 's more of them doing men 's fields . 
i like to see that . 
and i do n't like to see women waiting on men hand and foot 
but i believe in sharing and doing things for each other . 
i do too . 
i like the idea . 
my children , i have five children 
and they 're all married . 
and i love seeing the men help the women so much . 
i think it 's great . 
me too . 
i hope that happens to me someday . 
i do n't mind doing stuff . 
and i got to make him dinner and stuff 
but he 'll help me do the dishes . 
i do n't want to expect to help to clean up then after . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
i 've always taught my men that . 
they better clean up with their women and help them . 
and they 're good about it . 
but it is neat to see them all work together . 
they stay at work or go back to work . or whatever . 
and they 're well educated . 
they 're having a fit about how little there are . 
and i think we 'll see a lot more of upper management ? then we do now , even . 
i think it 'll escalate . 
in fact i work at a high school . 
and my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted 
and she 's very sharp . 
and the ethnic thing is a good thing now . 
me too . 
they 're moving them up 
and they 're sharp 
so you 're going to see a lot more of that in leadership i believe . 
i like to see that . 
i think it 's really neat to see and all that educated minority person who really knows what they 're talking about . 
and it 's just too bad that some people still look down on them just because of their color . 
that 's a shame . 
especially black women . 
but they would n't know what they 're doing . 
but i never have gone along with that even far back . 
years ago my mother was that way . 
the same . 
some people say the boys should n't have to do those jobs . the inside jobs . 
they had to do as much as we did . 
so that was good . 
same here . 
so i think that 's good . to keep the equal as far as , not necessarily by sex type thing . 
same here . 
you should be able to accomplish as much . 
and i think the attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now . 
you see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls you can do it . 
if he can do it , you can do it type thing . 
i see more men participating in the family things with children . helping to take care of them more . and , doing the jobs equally , 
what about politics on it ? 
i 'm not that big on politics . 
i 'm not that educated on it . 
i 'm kind of disgusted this year because i do n't see many women into the political scene 
and i really think we should have more political leaders in the women than we do and even for president and vice president this year , 
i agree with that . 
there 's nobody again . 
i forget her name now . 
i do n't know . 
but you know who i mean ? 
i know who you 're talking about . 
she took such a rough go of it . 
and their tax deal and , 
so that 's good . 
but i wish they would get some more on that . 
i did n't see any of the women in there . 
and right now i do n't think we have too many . in the forefront . 
congress woman . 
i have written this down 
do you think it 's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government ? 
you 're asking what my opinion about , whether it 's possible to have honesty in government . 
i suspect that it is possible . 
i think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody . 
that 's a good point . 
but other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty . 
that 's interesting . 
i had read something one time 
and it was just applying to governments in general , 
it was written many years ago . 
it said that it 's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers . 
and i thought that was interesting . 
it was n't just talking about our government . 
it was just government in general . from times past on 
so they 're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers . 
and that would be a next question to ask . 
because they want to be a service to us 
or are they in there for their own gains , 
and personally i feel there 's probably some of each . 
the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves , it may be more matter of not what can i steal while in an office but how many friends can i make while , i 'm in office . 
and how good a name can i make for myself and so forth . 
so i guess it would be like anything else . 
let 's see . 
but i agree with you , there 's a lot in business . 
i think a little more honesty in the campaigns would be , more to the point . 
i think we put too much on politicians . 
we expect them to only be there to serve us . 
if you knew what you were getting when you voted , 
that 's a problem , is n't it ? 
it 's interesting 
it 's so easy to blame them to 
a lot of times i think it 's our own fault . 
they lie to us because we do n't want to hear the truth . 
they say you , get the government you deserve . 
if they tell us the truth , we do n't elect them especially with all this stuff coming up here lately about people 's past , 
and i do n't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore . 
it 's hard to imagine . 
because it 's gotten 
we 're not talking about issues 
we 're talking about somebody 's personal life 
and we 're getting away from what we ought to be looking at . 
i also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out . 
i do n't think there would be too many left . 
you 're taking a government course ? 
at what ? 
the university ? 
and it 's really enjoyable . 
i like it . 
and then they also ask do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption , 
you can make laws against corruption . 
but that does n't eliminate it , does it ? 
i do n't think making laws will stop it . 
i do n't know how many laws you would have to have . 
i mean , 
sure did n't , did it ? 
so 
i think you can legislate 
but i think there 's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating , 
i just think that 's human nature that you 're going to have corruption in government , in business , personal life . 
actually , i think other countries may have it worse , 
usually involving the prime minister or people very close to him . 
i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes 
but when i think about where i 'd want to go this is still the best 
i 've been around to a few other countries 
and i have not found one yet that i would rather live in . 
at its worst i think we 've got the best . 
what is your favorite kind of music ? 
i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be classical music . 
same here . 
what type of music do you like in the classical area , 
or what era do you like the most ? 
i guess i like a wide range . everything from baroque through at least some modern music . 
and my wife and i these days are especially into opera . 
we 've been sort of opera fans for a few years now . 
the places we 've gone they sing in the original languages . 
and so we have quite a collection of those , 
and you watch them at home , 
so you figure out what 's going on after a while , 
and then you can enjoy it in the theater . 
what is that ? 
i did n't know that . 
that can help people like me . 
i can understand that . 
he 's definitely one of the top of that era . 
i like baroque music , 
course i like also string instruments , 
and i have two string in my house . instrument players , 
both my sons play string instruments . 
so , i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year . 
how old are they ? 
so they 're doing this in school , or what ? 
you 've got half a string quartet there . 
we 're on our way . 
so i try to enjoy all of it . 
a little bit , 
but a lot of the music i do n't know about as far as the titles , 
and i have to listen to it , and figure out , what i 'm listening to . 
i do belong to a musical heritage society . 
do you belong to that ? 
i do n't , 
but i think i know what it is . 
ca n't you get records through that or something , recordings ? 
you can get recordings . 
and they do a lot of original recordings themselves . 
i think . 
and they actually have them perform the music , 
and they record it . 
so , they 're actually commissioned performances . 
a lot of them are . 
or they will find out when they 're performing , 
and they will record the music at that time . 
and so it is high quality grade music , 
and , of course , now they also have a jazz section , 
i had heard good things about the music heritage society , 
but if i get involved in one of those things , i end up spending all my money on music . 
you can control it . 
my roommate signed me up . 
he got a bonus record , 
and i got a lot of bills . 
i see . 
so we have to watch that . 
that 's good . 
do you play any instrument yourself ? 
what type of magazines do you have ? 
we take several at home . 
i take skiing magazine , 
and i take discover magazine , and also c d and stereo review and national geographic and boys life . 
. 
that 's a good one , i like to get . 
so i take it that you like to ski . 
do you , receive a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine ? 
i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth , because i do get things from ski associations and things during the year . 
and do you receive discounts and things like that , 
not so much that , 
more likely to see those at a ski show or something , 
but i just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and new equipment that 's come out and so forth . 
some fashions are always in there too . 
did you receive information from your skiing magazine ? 
probably not . 
we already knew we wanted to take one , 
and we just started looking around . 
i may have referred to a couple of them , 
we have n't been there before . 
that sounds nice . 
it 's supposedly low lift lines . 
but i want to . 
you need to come out . 
i understand deer valley is nice , too . 
deer valley , 
they are , 
it 's wonderful snow . 
how about you , 
what magazines do you have at home ? 
and we do have national geographic , 
and then we have some church magazines , 
does it have articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth ? 
mostly they have , the ads on the equipment , 
but the whole magazine is just filled with pictures and projects that you can make yourself , 
and so , it 's really a fun one . 
i like that . 
that 's good . 
it 's good to get use out of one . 
i read it , 
but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time , 
i 've noticed that , too , 
but they have been nice to have around . 
every once in a while they come in handy . 
i liked that magazine 
but i just found myself not ever getting around to reading it . 
you get so many coming in , 
and by the time the next round comes in i 'm still not through reading the first round . 
that . 
i forgot , 
and that 's mostly my son 's , 
but i do read it , too . 
he likes to try that , 
does get to be a lot of paper though , 
they can do that . 
i found that they 've been fun for my little girls , 
they 're five and four years old , 
they 're just kind of getting started now . 
and so we 've found good use for those . 
mine is a senior in high school , 
so we 're kind of at the end of that trail . 
you 're just sort of beginning to think about first grade . 
it 's fun . 
i do have a boy in junior high , too , 
so we 're kind of running the gamut . 
i do n't really have a favorite type . 
i like a lot of different types of music . 
do you ? 
i have a tape collection that i like to listen to cassette tapes 
but it 's pretty varied . 
how about you ? 
i 'm very varied as well . 
i do n't think i 've ever met a type of music i do n't like except for maybe heavy metal and that . 
that 's exactly me . 
the acid rock or the heavy metal . 
even some of that i like okay but not , mostly , as a general rule , 
i do n't care for that at all . 
i do n't enjoy rap too much , either . 
that does n't appeal to my ears . 
as far as the rap goes , i think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves 
and i like some of their songs . 
i agree , 
with the general rule , i would n't choose rap either . 
but i like to listen to what you might call pop , easy listening country western , jazz classical , 
i like like i said , pretty varied music . 
i really love to listen to her , 
and they 're very harmonic 
they really are . 
so , they 're interesting to listen to . 
you might try that . 
how about you ? 
most likely i would listen to jazz or classical music . 
but jazz can get on my nerves after a while . 
you ca n't just listen to it especially a lot of the deeper stuff , 
you just ca n't listen to it for enjoyment unless you 're playing it , 
it 's too , 
you have to concentrate on it , it seems . 
it just does n't do anything . 
what about the blues or something like that ? 
blues are okay . 
i tell you , 
i grew up on blue grass music . 
my dad is a big blue grass fan , 
i would n't have admitted it when i was in high school 
but , i really do like it a lot . 
i like some of it , 
as far as what they now call country western , it does n't sound like the old country music at all , does it ? 
it does n't , 
it does n't . 
some of it sounds more like pop music . 
i do n't care for that . 
i grew up on him . 
that type of country western is what i like to listen to . 
asleep at the wheel . sons of the pioneers stuff like that . 
i like sound tracks a lot . 
do you ? 
it seems like you get a lot of original music that way . 
you sure do . 
think about the twin peaks and stuff like that that 's just real recent 
things like that i like to listen to . 
i like instrumental things . 
they 're great are n't they . 
they 're wonderful . 
i love them . 
like i said , that 's pretty varied . 
it sure is , 
he 's kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop , too . 
he has a nice smooth voice . 
and what i like the most about him , is , i 've gone to see him in concert , and he looks like he 's having fun . 
some people sing , 
and they have their faced all contorted , like it hurts them or something . 
but he looks like he 's having a good time . 
he 's up there moving around and smiling like he 's happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it , too . 
and he is real fun to listen to . 
i think it was five of them or something 
was it five , 
something like that , 
it was last year was n't it . 
last year or the year before , 
i ca n't remember , 
but i was listening to a particular radio station 
do you do artistic painting ? 
you do ? 
i have n't done any of the oil or watercolor . 
i would like to learn that someday , 
do you do a lot of it ? 
i took one class about three or four years ago 
and i 've done a little , 
but it takes a lot of time . 
it does , 
it is real time consuming 
do you sell your projects ? 
mostly i have just given them away as gifts . 
but i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job 
where do you work at ? 
do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique ? 
i 've wanted to do that but just have n't mass produced enough to do that . 
i have five children of my own , 
that keeps you busy . 
they keep me busy 
do you cut out your own projects ? 
and so i really enjoy doing that . 
do you ever spray your projects with a base coat first 
or do you brush it on ? 
i brush it on , 
i just bought a spray gun , one of those high volume , low pressure spray guns . 
and that 's what i bought it for . 
do you ? 
but i have n't used it yet . 
fine furniture . 
do you ? 
but it 's hard to finish it . 
but spraying does put on a nicer finish . 
that is interesting . 
what kind of equipment do you have ? 
let me see , 
it sounds like you 're really into it . 
that is nice . 
it is . 
the band saw is really nice . 
i do n't know if you 've ever heard of those . 
but it 's nice to have the right equipment . 
that makes it easier , does n't it ? 
have you sold any of your furniture or just , 
mostly i do like you do , 
give it away as gifts . 
but , making my own furniture . 
that 's interesting . 
did you take classes to learn how to do that ? 
just in junior high 
and then i just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment , kept up with that . 
that is interesting . 
i do n't know if i necessarily want to do furniture , 
but mostly just do more , 
so , it 's fun . 
i guess i 'll let you go now . 
they come on , 
we 're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us . 
they do ? 
so this is my first one . 
you 're probably a veteran at this . 
it has been really fun . 
i 've enjoyed this . 
so i think you 'll enjoy doing it . 
it 's fun . 
sounds fun . 
and it 's there by the , copper mill restaurant , 
let 's see , 
i 'm trying to think of the name . 
i do n't right off . 
i guess it 's pretty deep feelings , 
i saw that as well . 
the guy 's gouging your eyes out , 
what are you going to do ? 
what for him to finish me off . 
finally drew a high draft number , 
and you ? 
i was much too young , 
both my brothers were draft age , 
but neither of them wound up going over , which , i think they were very happy for . 
personally i just went in limbo . 
i had a passport and was ready to go out of the country or join special forces , 
either one . 
i just did n't know . 
so do you feel that it was worth what we did over there ? 
just a second . 
. mark what was that again ? 
do you think , the investment in lives and money was worth it ? 
i totally agree with that . 
what effects do you think it 's had on our country ? 
downside . 
the says we should go into the grief that 's there 
and presidents have always avoided that as a country . 
so it 's pretty serious , really , 
lot of things that are n't being addressed . 
i think that 's pretty typical of the entire involvement over that nothing was really addressed , 
we announced that we were going to war , 
you remember that ? 
is n't that something ? 
mark i 've got to go . 
we 'll see you . 
i guess our five minutes are up according to me . 
are they to you ? 
i was n't really keeping count . 
but i guess , 
mostly word processing applications and just as a dumb terminal . 
but i think eventually i 'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that . 
i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base , 
i 'm just starting to get into a little bit more communications now . 
you do n't have to make a hard copy that way . 
are you using windows ? 
i used to use just an apple two e , which of course looks pretty primitive now . 
that 's what i learned a lot of languages on , was an apple two e in my high school . 
i use it in my business . 
what do you do ? 
are they based on a , other language , 
that 's the kind of thing i 'm working with exactly . 
you seem to be better informed than the average person on that . 
it was just when i was , i worked for the community school , 
i imagine it 's a lot harder on a computer because you do n't have as many cues , 
you do n't have hand gestures and things like that . 
what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed , though . 
most of the stuff that i do is not interactive 
and i use it for data analysis on testing , 
actually , just , item analysis , statistical analysis of the tests , 
when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones are n't find out how reliable the test is , 
you try . 
so it involves a lot of spreadsheet use . 
i would imagine so . 
so what were you doing when you were using an apple two e ? 
i was doing some of the same stuff , but doing it more slowly , and with smaller files . 
i ca n't believe i 've got five megabytes on this one now 
it 's amazing how in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much . 
and then i started playing with apples , 
that 's the low end . 
but i have n't upgraded it quite that far yet . 
i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and get possibly another hard disk . 
i do n't know . 
they say that system seven uses a lot of memory . 
i imagine . 
so you have eight children . 
what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together . 
generally cheap things . 
we know how that goes . 
with lots of kids you do n't have lots of money for recreation . 
that 's right . 
that 's fun . 
so let 's see , 
some of the things we do together as a family , we like to play games a lot , 
and you may think this is funny , 
and that is so fun . 
the kids just get a crack out of that . 
we do like to go to the park , too like your family . 
we do n't do a lot of vacationing . 
we get an occasional one or two day thing 
where do they live ? 
so that 's a bit of a drive for you there . 
so you like to go there for the holidays 
we do n't go very often for holidays . 
what are the ages of your kids then ? 
so you have some in the nest and some out . 
that 's right . 
how old are your children ? 
ours start at twelve 
and then they go down to four . 
i think the hardest thing for us is to find leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together with the age span that we have , 
i bet , 
the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing 
but the young kids do n't understand it 
and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that , 
and then if you want to play something on the little kids ' level , then the older kids get real bored , 
and they want to do something else . 
i can relate to that . 
do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one ? 
i think it 's improving , actually . 
we had an interesting experience the other day . 
we have pretty much a routine that we spend , 
and we just kind of keep them at home 
and our next door neighbor was there , 
and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them . 
that 's good . 
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now . 
i think it 's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction 
and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now . 
i think so , 
and it does begin with the families at home 
and so i 'm a firm believer in that , too . 
i think a lot of people are panicked , how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they 've got to start doing something . 
that 's true . 
and hopefully it 's going to spread . . 
very few . 
very few . 
you feel like you 're in the minority ? 
when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we did n't have good sense . 
average . 
never been back , since then , 
but , we have kids up there now , 
so we get up occasionally . 
i do n't have any idea . 
i 've never heard of it . 
must be a little town . 
i guess it 's out there , clear out . 
they have a ranch that has five hundred acres , 
i do . 
and what kind do you have ? 
i live alone in an apartment except for the cat . 
how about you ? 
we have a cat , 
they 're just aggressive by nature 
so he 's an indoor cat , 
he has been really aggressive especially towards my little girl , for some reason . 
he 's been so mean to her . 
and you say you 've had him how long ? 
we 've had him for about two years 
two years . 
and he was so mean to her right after we first got him . 
and now he bites her . 
he ca n't scratch her any more , 
he bites her . 
does he bite her enough to draw blood ? 
he has a couple of times , 
he loves my son , 
it 's his cat , 
and he 's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him 
and he 's so funny , 
he just follows my son around just like a dog . 
he wo n't even let my son shower . 
and , while he showers , it 's so hilarious . 
so he 's quite a animal . 
i guess . 
as long as he does n't get too aggressive with the daughter he 's all right . 
you would n't want him to carry her off or something . 
we did actually take him to the pound a couple of times because we just could n't have him being so aggressive towards the girl , 
but he seems to have mellowed out a little bit , 
and we do keep our daughter away from him . 
were it not for my son , the cat would not be in this house . 
is that the only pet that you have ? 
it is , 
we tried a dog about four years ago , 
anyway it ended up being just a huge , huge dog that ate us out of house and home . 
we 're in a house , 
i see . 
we could n't allow him to run free , 
so , he was just chained up all the time , 
and it was unfortunate . 
have you tried any other pets ? 
i live alone in an apartment , 
especially when they 're young when they bring them in 
and do they just paper train it or something ? 
i guess . 
i guess , 
and i would imagine that they do n't have many more than one to start with , either . 
that would be fun if you could get them trained . 
otherwise they 're pretty smelly . 
that 's right . 
did you see the dog show , 
we do n't have cable . 
i see . 
and they had that on last week , 
and that 's really kind of something to watch , 
it 's on two or three nights for maybe an hour or two 
is that right ? 
some of them are really beautiful , too . 
i 'd be , interesting to watch . 
we live out here 
and we really love it out here . 
it 's kind of country . 
so , we 're kind of country but not too . 
do you ? 
this is the very first one i 've talked to . 
i 've been doing it for about two weeks 
i do n't know . 
i think the budget is really out of hand right now , 
and especially in this election year , i think that there ought to be at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this . 
it kind of seems to me that everyone 's offering their token little tax cut program when it 's just such a bad time for it . 
and as you said , mostly they are token cuts . 
that 's really not going to do a lot of good to your average middle income person . 
you can buy a coke or something for that . 
mostly it 's not actually a cut , 
it 's just a cut in the amount withheld . 
i have n't really heard much of what the other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either , 
especially the democratic candidates do n't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point . 
i have a lot of respect for him . 
i will not 
read my lips , or whatever 
and then ten months later he said , , i ca n't follow through on this . 
but it seems to me that the budget is so out of hand , 
and especially now that they say , the cold war is over 
and we 're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of x number of billion , trillion dollars a year . 
i 'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go , 
because , in my opinion , i do n't think i 'm ever going to see any of this so-called peace dividend . 
i 'm not really in favor of large government social programs , either , because i feel that they waste money , also , 
but with this peace dividend , it seems like you could set up some kind of public works projects like they had in the thirties , or whatever . 
i think that would be a great idea . 
it would help unemployment greatly . 
and i surely do n't hear anybody saying that right now . 
i agree totally . 
it just seems so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen . 
i 'm in college right now , 
so am i . 
where do you go ? 
i had the required political science class a couple of years ago . 
and one of the things we discussed was how the budget situation just got so out of hand . 
and the democratic congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and , created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit . 
it 's just like they 're playing chicken with a loaded gun . 
it 's a loaded cannon . 
they 've got trillions of dollars to spend every year , 
and they , in my opinion , do n't do a very responsible job of spending that money . 
for the moment , 
and then i 'm going to go on and just forget everything that i said 
or it does n't seem that it 's going to make much of a difference . 
i do n't know , 
not at all . 
i just do n't think it was a well thought out incentive . 
how do you feel about crime in the city ? 
actually i live in the city 
and i guess it is a concern of mine for my own safety . 
that 's right . 
. i think it is bad in certain areas , 
however i think , the area that i live in the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the city . 
i think it seems that there 's certain areas where the crime is focused . 
what do you think can be done about the crime in the city ? 
and they 've had some impact , but not a tremendous amount , 
and probably they need to try to increase community involvement , that sort of thing , i think . 
i probably agree with that . 
particularly in some of the housing projects that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused 
they 've got to kind of change the way people think about it . 
that 's probably true . 
i 'd say it 's probably in the top ten in terms of crime . 
i do n't think it 's as bad as l a either . 
i do n't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have . 
that seems to be true . 
and as you walk through the street on a given evening , you can see crimes being committed . 
it 's that obvious . 
i do n't know , 
that 's true . 
with a big stick 
and do n't be looking around like you 've never been there before and you have no idea where you are . 
do n't walk down an alley 
just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation 
but 
there are times when you ca n't avoid all that 
and then you 're kind of on your own . 
the only thing i 've ever had , was i 've had my wallet lifted 
but that was in a more of a setting where there was a number of people around , 
i was much younger at the time 
and kind of a couple of people , they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off , so i did n't know who had it . 
i 've had that happen , 
but that 's about it . 
i think i 've only actually seen one actual robbery with a gun 
and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed . 
i 've had my car stolen , 
so maybe that counts . 
where was that ? 
was that downtown 
metropolitan , 
and there 's a lot of car thefts in that area . 
i 've known some people that have had their cars stolen . 
and when he got it back his dashboard was sitting in the front seat . 
it had been wrecked 
and some superficial type damage , 
but they did n't strip it 
so i got it back . 
than most . 
so does insurance pay for the body damage , 
or was that all there was , body . 
it was about three grand to put everything together . 
they cracked the steering column of course , to steal the car . 
you crack the steering column 
and you can start it up , basically pretty easily . 
so how do you know this much about stealing cars ? 
. how 's your products been ? 
i really have n't had too many problems . 
seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out . 
i hear that one . 
have you had any lately go out ? 
unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time , when i bought my new house , 
and i really do n't have any recourse , 
so i had to call and have them all repaired and that . 
so you did n't get anything , 
even , all the warranties were out ? 
the refrigerator warranty 's still good , 
but the ice maker itself , passed its three years , 
and it was three years and two months . 
we just moved into a new house , too , 
so we had to buy all those , too . 
watch out . 
i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail 
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings . 
i just ended up using it . 
but , that 's about the only thing i 've had gone wrong . 
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances , 
it was within two days that all three of these stopped working , 
and the ice maker had to have a new pump , 
that 's incredible . 
so it was almost three hundred dollars for all three of them . 
and they all went out at the same time ? 
within two days of each other . 
or two days . 
it was n't a good week . 
i was pretty mad . 
and plus the place that i 'd bought them all had gone out of business , 
but still they were through that retailer , 
so i do n't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not . 
it 's frustrating . 
but i did n't have to worry about all that , because they were n't under warranty . 
so . it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all , 
they go out a lot ? 
i 've had two or three of those go out . 
one was under warranty , 
and the other two were n't , 
i do n't think products are getting much better though . 
i 'm in the manufacturing 
and make automotive air bags , the safety air bags . 
that 's interesting . 
it 's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment . 
we test everything after each assembly process , 
and so our testing is pretty thorough , 
do you test each individual one 
if you 've got ten , you test one , 
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay ? 
we test every one electrically . 
i think they test four or five a day , actually exploding the air bags 
but we do test during the assembly product , , 
so , each assembly process has an inspection right after it 's done , 
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process , 
that 's something i 've never had to use , 
i 've never been involved in an automobile accident , 
but i think it 's a great idea . 
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about 
they do all the testing that we have to do through the government , 
it 's incredible how much testing they have to do . 
i do n't mind spending the extra money on the car even if they pass the cost onto the consumer , because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing . 
i guess we 're going to describe job benefits , 
and so what next to salary do you rank , is the most important job benefits ? 
i would say the medical group insurance area as far as covering medical costs for yourself or family members . 
does your company have good benefits in that regard ? 
i work for a public school district 
so it 's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing , 
where the school district does the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of costs . 
but overall i 've been pleased with it over the years . 
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year , our district has had to change companies , 
or now we 're on a managed care thing , which has stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any . 
i see . 
how about yourself ? 
so , in my opinion , that 's bordering on a health clinic , 
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage . 
they usually sign a contract or something 
and i did have surgery last summer 
and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day , 
and i 've never seen another bill , 
so i have to say it really works . 
but , again , i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it . 
that 's right , 
i 'm fairly young myself , 
three years ago is when i first got into full time employment 
and for me it 's worked out real good . 
but if you have a family and , everybody 's gone to different doctors it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and just has all the medical history 
and you feel comfortable with it . 
i 'm sure it would be very stressful 
and , my husband and i have just elected that if that happens , i will go and just pay . 
you can continue to go to your own doctor 
but your benefits are not as good , 
you mentioned you work for a school system . 
and i guess another one that i rank up there high is the kind of job flexibility and time off i enjoy as a benefit . 
i do too . 
are you talking about spring break 
getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that , and having a lot of vacation . 
i 'm not a teacher , 
i am a secretarial executive assistant , 
but i do n't think the teachers could stand the stress all year long frankly . 
they want everybody educated , no matter what it costs , 
in two weeks we have spring break , 
and i do n't know who looks forward to it more , the students or the teachers and the staff . 
what do you do there ? 
i 'm not actually on the teaching faculty , 
but we have a large research organization associated with the university , 
and that 's who i work with . 
and we 're given a good bit of flexibility in what we do . 
we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study . 
that 's good . 
and it 's good that they allow you that . 
we do have to work the day , 
but we do get many days off , 
and we all look forward to it . 
that 's the only reason i work there , is that my children now have graduated from college 
but at the time , i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs 
and i 've just continued to stay there . 
are there any things that you 'd like to see changed in terms of the benefits ? 
i do . 
i like to play basketball and weight lifting . 
those are probably the two main things i like to do . 
so those are more or less indoor sports . 
in the winter , typically it 's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis . 
i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring , fall , 
but in the winter it gets pretty cold . 
so it 's mostly indoor sports in the winter . 
how about yourself ? 
i 'm on a exercise program . 
and i feel like that 's been a real nice exercise in the winter time . 
first of all i 'd like to get my weight off . 
and so i 'd like to get the weight off , 
and then i 'd really like to get into that . 
and my husband and i have a , aerobic video that 's called the firm . 
i do n't know if you 've heard of it , 
but it 's an aerobic video with , not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down , 
but you 're using weights , 
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done . 
it 's really fun . 
it 's similar to aerobics with weights 
but it 's like low impact aerobics , just with weights . 
are you familiar with step or bench aerobics ? 
i am , 
but i have never done it myself . 
have you done that ? 
i have . 
that 's the in thing . 
that 's the big thing ? 
at first it was just regular aerobics , 
but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over . 
so how is that ? 
they call it a low impact aerobics , 
and it 's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time . 
and from when i 've done it , it does give you a real good workout . 
but only thing i 'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees , 
that and movement of going up on the step , 
that could create a problem . 
they seem to think that it wo n't , 
but you never know . 
do you have healthy knees ? 
i think my ankles probably are my main weak point . 
but , i 've kind of taken care of that . 
and wearing that i have n't had any problems in the past year or so . 
that 's good . 
you sound just like my husband . 
so that 's what he does , 
he wears his brace and his high tops 
it would only take three or four days 
and i could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way . 
so how successful is your exercise video ? 
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches 
and then , every other day i 'd like to incorporate the video , and then the bike on the other day . 
but , it is really amazing how fast the inches come off , 
and the muscle builds real fast . 
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month 
and it 's a hour long video , 
so it 's a good workout . 
it is , 
i really enjoy that , 
so i 'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy . 
it 's quite cold . 
this one has been quite mild . 
we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter , because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground . 
it was quite chilly , 
how do you get most of your current event information ? 
i 'm going to school right now , 
and while i 'm working , i do n't get a chance to read the paper a lot , 
and i do , like to do other stuff with it . 
while i 'm at work sometimes , on the computer network i read the news sometimes , 
and that 's kind of helpful . 
you keep up on what 's going on . 
that 's true , 
my roommates and stuff people around me talk about it . 
i 'm a housewife , 
i have three kids , 
do you watch major network news , 
just the regular channel 
just channel eight . 
that 's our channel here 
that 's the eyewitness news . 
so it 's kind of different . 
it 's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on , 
but it seems that they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they report on the news . 
and i think even in the elections , they choose who they 're going to follow and who they 're not , 
and basically if a candidate can get them to follow , then the news will kind of publicize his name . 
i do n't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it . 
i think you get a very lopsided picture of what 's going on . 
you just ca n't get a full picture of their message unless you have time to sit down and probably read something on it . 
and the news , too , it just does n't cover that many stories , 
it just covers your basic violent crimes and your catastrophes with weather and stuff , 
but other than that , you really do n't know what 's going on . 
i will read our current letters that come out on elections 
and , i guess i do read that , 
and i do study who 's running in our area , 
and i do study what 's going on in the economy . 
and , i guess i do read other magazines too , to get my information . 
i subscribe to science news , 
and that 's real good because it gives a brief summary of , or the updates of what 's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would bog me down that i would n't know about 
but other than that i do n't really read , 
i do n't really subscribe to anything else . 
i used to read every month a reader 's digest 
but now i guess i just have friends that clip articles 
of course , when we were in war , i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on . 
but a lot of the times , i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper , 
but i just ca n't seem to find the time . 
if they put it out in a video , or on , not a video but a cassette tape or something , where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things . 
i know , 
we 're trying to get tickets to it right now . 
that 's going to be crazy that time of year here . 
i guess people want to hear about it . 
and they did so well last year . 
they spend a long time on sports , 
and i think that that 's fine , 
i would like to see more time spent on other things . 
i do n't know , 
they way they do the newscasts , i wish they kind of separated it , 
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it 
but i do n't have cable . 
i think that one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't convict someone who really should n't be convicted . 
definitely . 
and i think that a unanimous verdict helps to ensure that . 
i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way , that you would have a problem that you would n't convict someone who maybe should be convicted . 
have you ever served on a jury before ? 
i have twice . 
it was a pretty wild experience . 
what sorts of cases were they ? 
they were just small time cases where trailers and banks were involved . 
so were they criminal or civil ? 
they were civil . 
they were n't any criminal . 
what was the verdict ? 
did the jury have trouble reaching a decision ? 
and the one changed his vote at the end . 
so it became unanimous after they turned it in 
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in 
but it then became unanimous . 
. but since it was a civil case it really did n't matter ? 
you just needed a majority ? 
what was the other case ? 
that was also civil ? 
the other case was just traffic , 
and it was seat belt law 
and it did n't even hardly go through , 
did n't really even count . 
i 'm a college student 
so i have n't been a jury eligible age for very long 
but i declined it which i 'm able to do because i 'm a student , because it was a very bad time . 
you learn a lot going to the juries like that though . 
i would like to do at some point , 
but , i have n't . 
one thing that i think maybe is a problem is i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now , 
but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well . 
i would n't think that it does from what i experienced in them , 
it did n't turn out the way i planned it the way that i would think that it would go . 
you thought it turned out pretty well ? 
and it just was n't organized enough for me . 
i 'm not used to it not being organized , 
and i just assumed that it would have been . 
so it was just kind of a zoo 
someone had to figure out what was going on ? 
that 's about what it was . 
. that 's interesting . 
did it work out pretty well in the end ? 
they picked one person , 
so it did end up working out pretty well ? 
it ended up working all right . 
and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract , 
it 's sort of a matter of sometimes getting into very technical issues , 
and i wonder if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about whatever issue is under discussion . 
i do n't think that they educate them enough to really know what 's going on . 
in the case you were involved in , you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind . 
the bank was suing them because they went to get the trailer which was seemingly their property . 
it was on his property . 
so the deal was that he had borrowed money from the bank to buy it , 
and he had n't made the payments . 
so they came to get it . 
and he would n't let them take it off . 
so they were suing to get it back . 
and it was a double wide , 
so they 'd already taken it apart . 
so they left it there 
and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it . 
so they were suing him for the money , 
i guess the recording has started now . 
have you ever served on a jury ? 
i served , 
a lot of the same rules apply . 
have you ever served on one ? 
i finally served on one last year . 
i 've been voting for years , 
and i could n't figure out why i had n't been called yet 
and i finally was . 
so it was an interesting experience . 
i was kind of boring . 
was it civil or criminal ? 
it was municipal court 
and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks 
i see . 
so it was a combination of criminal and civil , 
most of the time we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors 
and then , it was always exciting when we got called to go , because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides just sit in the jury room . 
did the judge hand down sentences 
or did you folks do that ? 
the judge did . 
i had a hard time getting seated on a jury . 
and they kept dismissing me . 
course they do n't have to give a reason , 
they want to get the best mix for their case , 
so they ask all kinds of wild questions . 
that 's a science in itself . 
i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions , 
and i think part of it was they did n't like the fact that i do n't drink any more . 
i see . 
because you 'd probably be too puritanical 
that was probably it , 
although in my case i might have been more sympathetic with the person who got caught , 
i do n't know . 
were the sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair , 
if you were deciding , do you think that they would have been different . 
i was never there for any sentencing . 
and we got into the jury room to decide the case , 
and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he did n't need to deliberate , because he 'd already decided that the guy was not guilty , and he would never vote for guilty . 
so they appointed me jury foreman 
so i told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we could n't get one member of the jury to deliberate . 
so the whole thing had to be tried over again . 
i bet that made him happy . 
it was funny . 
i do n't know , 
i did n't like not being able to deliberate . 
i wanted to vote guilty for the guy , 
and the other people were kind of mixed 
so the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again . 
cost him a lot of money , 
i 'm sure . 
how many members were on the jury ? 
was it a six or twelve member jury ? 
it must have been six . 
that 's kind of curious to me . 
i thought that it was always twelve men tried and true , so to speak . 
but apparently for some crimes , it 's permissible to have six people sit in judgment . 
it 's a simple majority rules . 
let 's see , 
is it on capital crimes that they have to be unanimous 
probably on capital , 
i do n't know , 
the two that i were on had to do with drugs 
the government really failed to prove its case , 
and being fair to the person , if the government does n't prove its case , no matter how you feel , you have to go by what 's offered as proof , 
and we had to acquit him in both cases . 
all they could do was testify , 
pretty good , 
pretty good . 
we 're talking about drug testing in the work place . 
drug testing in the work place . 
. i 've been tested a few times , just before employment . 
but that 's about it . 
i 've never had random drug testing . 
we have random drug testing in my business , 
but i 've never had to do it . 
they started that about a year ago , 
and i think it 's mostly for the field people that drive trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff . 
but they have done some testing around our office , mostly after lunch , looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time , 
they do with alcohol . 
they do it with alcohol ? 
they 'll check for alcohol . 
once you start doing that stuff , you 're sort of stuck into checking for the whole thing . 
. that 's interesting . 
what type of field of work are you in ? 
i 'm in the oil business . 
in the oil business . 
i work in the office , 
so it 's pretty safe environment . 
i work in the automotive air bag industry , where we make the safety bags for the cars , 
and we work around a lot of explosives . 
that sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on . 
i 'm all for it , because the type of environment i work in they 're working with explosives , 
they have safety features with each of the explosives they use , 
but still , it can be dangerous . 
i agree . 
i think that under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working in high risk industries , where you can really hurt other people , that you need to have that kind of stuff . 
as long as it 's not abused random , 
as long as it 's random , and the individual 's rights are protected , i do n't have that big a problem with it . 
do they fire them , 
this is it , 
this is where i start having my problems with my company . 
i work for a private company , 
and the policy is something like if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem , then you 're eligible for company counseling . 
but if they catch you , if you test positive for a controlled substance , then you get fired . 
it 's probably the same thing . 
it 's one of those things that you read once , 
and then , if you 're not worried about it , you just forget about it . 
that 's right . 
but i know , they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance , 
but i 'm not sure if it 's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in . 
our company 's a little tougher on the second chance . 
if they 're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in , then they ought to go out of the way a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated to get back at your job . 
but when you 're a private company , the rules do n't always apply . 
it 's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment 
i guess i have n't run into anybody that 's been a problem . 
so i guess it works much like any lottery , 
everybody 's got an equal chance to get picked . 
you could time it just right . 
i know one employee , i know , when i was working with , he had alcohol on his breath , 
and i 'm not sure if our policy covers that or not . 
that 'd be just as dangerous . 
especially around equipment , machinery and stuff . 
. that 's true . 
i 've gone out and had a beer at lunch time , but not to excess in any case . 
do they give any limits on alcohol , 
i do n't remember , to tell you the truth . 
i do n't think they do . 
they must , 
that just shows you how much i 've been paying attention , 
because i really do n't know . 
i 'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask . 
you can take some of that testing a little bit too far . 
it was not only drugs , 
i do n't really think that it 's too many , 
i think it 's a severe invasion of somebody 's privacy to say , we 're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you 're worthy of working for us . 
i really do n't see that that 's a very valid thing for a company to say , 
and personally , i do n't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what 's inside my body . 
do you think it 's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they 'll take drugs ? 
suppose they found out some other way ? 
i think the problem here is that a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs . 
there can be false positive results , and that sort of thing . 
i do n't think there 's any definitive this person is taking drugs , 
so we do n't want him here . 
like i said , some industries , though , i think it 'd be very necessary , 
i would n't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i 'm flying in an airplane . 
but i find it to be pretty offensive that it 's such a big deal . 
i think it 's a whole trust issue . 
i just ca n't see it . 
but , have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested 
i have been . 
it 's very humiliating , 
and i 'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs , 
it 's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i 'm going to talk to you . 
i had it during a job interview , 
and i just thought it was dumb of the company , at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them to do this , 
and i 'm just i 'm not even going to think much about it if you 're going to treat me with this much respect even before you 've gotten to know me . 
it was a job interview 
and then you had a physical , where you were drug tested , 
and i do n't really want you to look at it , or something pretty basic like that , 
just to the fact that i do n't know that it is a company 's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they 're not at work . 
and these are not , 
but when it enters into what they 're doing when they 're not at work , i find that to be fairly offensive also . 
like you say if it 's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt , then really the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors . 
and if you are doing drugs and it 's causing a problem , then they 'll notice it for other reasons . 
that 's exactly right . 
and i think that it just moves down along a line that i really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees ' lives outside of work , 
we 're not going to hire you if you smoke . 
i can see how they can say in the work place you do n't want them to smoke , 
but when somebody leaves work , i do n't think that it 's the employer 's right to regulate their life style at all . 
do you think it should be illegal for an employer to do this 
and other than that i do not think it should be allowable . 
i think it should be illegal for them to want to do that . 
it 's kind of the big brother syndrome , 
anything like that just kind of scares me . 
even though i do n't think i 'd work for a company that did that , i sort of want to defend an employer 's rights in addition to an individual 's rights , 
but an employer , really has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to 
and if they say they do n't want smokers , i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that . 
i pressed the button one , 
so we 're recording right now . 
i 'm sorry . 
that 's okay . 
have you ever had to plan a family reunion ? 
it was n't really a planning one , 
but it was a birthday 
and i brought a lot of family together then . 
and how did you feel it went ? 
it went pretty good . 
i 've worked in hotels , 
so i kind of know how to do these things . 
i used to . 
all this planning and getting together and such . 
let 's see what else . 
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it 's my grandmother 's birthday , 
she comes from a big family . 
she has seven sisters i think . 
they show up and all their kids . 
let 's see , 
she has four sons and two daughters , 
and they show up and all their kids , 
so it 's a pretty big reunion , 
it 's about two hundred people , maybe . 
what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together ? 
probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone could eat comfortably and everything . 
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that for the rent , we rented a rescue squad building or something like that . 
and everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for soft drinks 
and so nobody really got stuck with the bill . 
that 's good . 
and each person in the family brought a dish , or something . 
and then did you have a main meal , 
it was just pot luck . 
it was kind of pot luck . 
everybody brought their specialties , i guess you would say . 
show off a little bit . 
and of course my grandmother 's food was , as always , gone first because she 's such a great cook . 
how old is she ? 
she looks probably like she 's in her early sixties 
that 's neat , that she 's in good health , at that age . 
my nickname for her is honey woman . 
that 's what i call her . 
that sounds fun . 
i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago , 
we sent out five hundred announcements , because our family is quite large , like your family there . 
and so that was a real challenge , 
and i was president of our family reunion for two years , 
and i was n't very at that duty , for two years in a row , 
but i found that advance planning was the key to success . 
also one thing that 's helpful , 
and i do n't know if your family 's spread out or whatever 
but all my family lives in the same county 
that 's wonderful , though . 
but it 's just kind of like get on the telephone 
and , it 's so and such days from such and such date 
and everybody just shows up . 
that is helpful . 
i would say you 're spread out , then . 
we are . 
my immediate family my parents and my brothers and sisters , i guess we 're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever , 
because my dad was in the army 
so we 're spread out , 
nobody moves away except us . 
they must really like it there . 
i got out as soon as i graduated . 
just this town is too small for me , 
you want to start ? 
i might as well . 
one of the things i 'm very concerned about the air pollution , is the ozone layer issue . 
that 's stuff we never even thought about three years ago . 
they could be made and lots of it , 
and its properties were great with the machinery , 
did n't have to have lots of expensive machinery to get your heating and cooling cycles to work . 
have they stopped that practice now ? 
and that 's got me very highly concerned that that 's going to be quite a while before we can undo this . 
that could spawn several good industries and help , pull us out of this recession , 
but you got to have people that can earn a salary to pay for this conversion . 
how many families own a refrigerator , 
there are people that have a thriving business that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on automobiles and trucks , 
and that 's a polluting type deal too , is the excessive petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth , 
i hate to see a car going down the street , or even a truck or bus for that matter , that 's putting out a lot of dark smoke , 
and i know there 's a lot of pollutants we ca n't even see coming out of cars , 
diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine 
diesel is going to be around , because it does n't evaporate easily , 
its latent heat is high , 
but it 's slow burning at , normal pressures . 
i see . 
bill , 
bill , 
and i every month camp at least one weekend 
and during the summer we camp two or three weeks a year . 
that sounds good . 
i 'd say i camp quite a bit . 
you do . 
do you have a lot , 
where do you find places to camp ? 
and we also carry all our equipment with us 
how about yourself ? 
we have five children , 
so we 've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out , 
and we have gone up into the mountains and not necessarily roughed it , 
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains . 
that 's good . 
and , then our boys are old enough now , 
and so , they 're involved in the scouting 
and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week , 
and so this year they 'll both be going , 
and so that 's been real enjoyable for them . 
is that right ? 
and what does that consist of ? 
they 're very light weight 
they 're not very heavy 
so you carry them with you , 
and they 'll keep you dry or whatever . 
my bones are getting so old , 
so , have you had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that ? 
we saw a lot of deer in the morning and the afternoon 
just deer everywhere . 
so of course we do n't want to go hunting . 
but we got to see a lot of deer out and about 
of course , we see smaller animals all the time , 
and one thing that is a big concern in the evening , at night is make sure that all the food 's put away and so forth because we have armadillos . 
they 're covered with a heavy armor type stuff , 
and we have those creatures down here that they like to go hunting for a midnight snack . 
and so that can be a problem if you do n't put all your equipment away . 
but they wo n't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything . 
they will if you attack them . 
but most time they run away from you if they see you 're up 
but they do n't have any problem walking right by you if you 're asleep . 
that sounds a little less fierce than bears . 
should begin . 
i can begin this , 
and the benefit program we have here is really quite good . 
i 'm pretty pleased with it . 
they cover just about everything , vision , dental , medical 
you name it , 
and for me this is the first job i 've had where they 've covered that much , 
so i 'm pretty satisfied myself . 
what 's your situation ? 
and our benefits package is n't quite as good in some ways . , 
overall i 'm satisfied with it . 
we do n't have the vision care , 
we do have the health care and the dental . 
are you a professor there ? 
i 'm on the professional administrative and technical staff , 
i see , 
so probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the , very generous vacation time and sick time . 
no doubt . 
that 's good . 
i used to work with the army research institute , 
and being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off . 
but here you do n't get that . 
you maybe get two or three a year . 
so , that 's kind of a drawback i think . 
but . i do n't know . 
what do you consider most important in terms of the different benefits ? 
i think the health care , of course , is an important , and has to be the single most important benefit 
and the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing , 
i 'm a little disturbed about that , 
but i think that 's a national trend , 
and i do n't know what the solution is to it . 
it 's bigger than just the benefits part . 
it 's kind of an interesting plan . 
it 's kind of cold though . 
and the ones above would . 
so it 's kind of like drawing this line 
and if you have it 
if you do n't , you 're kind of out of luck 
but it was kind of an interesting show . 
i think you 're right , 
i think health care is probably the pressing one , 
but i 'll tell you , i do n't mind having dental , 
sometimes dental costs can be just about as expensive , if not more , 
and i know historically a lot of companies carried dental as a rider along with the medical 
but i 'm not sure that 's widely followed any more . 
i 'm not sure , 
we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental depending , 
and the cost between them is very little . 
i think it costs me something like five dollars a month for the dental plan . 
but it pays a substantial amount . 
and it covers the bulk of the dental expenses . 
is that the same for both professors and also staff and administration , 
is that generally across the board , do you think 
it is . 
i think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody , and the retirement plan . 
but the main difference is in the way sick time is accrued and vacation time is accrued . 
for the operating staff it 's based on how long they 've worked there . 
that determines how much vacation time they get . 
i 'm kind of interested because actually , that 's the route i 'd like to take when i finally get my degree is to teach in a university . 
that 's interesting . 
that 's one of the things i 'd like to think about is what kind of benefits they would cover and things like that . 
is that right ? 
you 're first . 
and plus , for me , it 's medical and benefits and dental . 
they 're also important . 
so there is a progressive path , 
but not being in the commercial sector , the motivation is n't there for a lot of people really , 
are they pretty much train for a specific job 
and what i hired for and then just very little variation from that . 
somewhat that , 
but then also there just is n't the ability to in one sense have a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances . 
so that 's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution , 
it 's a little more difficult to recognize an individual 's performance 
and i suppose that 's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution , perhaps somewhat even with the business . 
but i agree the medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the security aspect for long term employment , 
that 's interesting though . 
because i do n't know if that 's necessarily the case anymore . 
you mean job security ? 
job security , 
that use to be a couple of years ago , 
but i do n't know if it is so much anymore . 
some people had been there a long time . 
we are seeing that here as well . 
i think it 's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world in institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses , we need to cut back , that 's what we do . 
no doubt 
in one sense for us , it 's where it makes the least noise which means it 's often the lowest support type roles . 
that 's exactly it . 
where it cuts back the most . 
i think that 's one of the things too . 
you get too many management people . 
it 's very easy . 
and it 's very easy for them to say , this is the best way when they really are n't aware of what all it took to get the work done . 
and then they wonder why it does n't get done in the same amount of time . 
those people are n't there anymore . 
because it 's support people that are providing the speed for it . 
what else do you think is important ? 
that 's maybe the majority of the importance , i guess . 
because my perspective is from an institution , 
but if you 're in the corporate world there is considerable motivation for innovation , 
although the more complex your structure the less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through 
but i think it 's a long term type of process where in a small organization things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts . 
i was going to say it 's more personal for one thing . 
you probably have a better team cooperation , or team playing , atmosphere . 
probably , 
where as in a bigger corporation , i think you 're just a number . 
you end up being your own person 
and if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up then that 's their problem 
i think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished . 
it becomes the organization instead of person being a part of the individual themselves . 
how do you feel about trial by jury ? 
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently . 
in what way ? 
in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than by evidence that 's presented . 
i have very little regard for the law , presently practiced . 
are you talking about with criminal or civil suits ? 
i was thinking primarily criminal cases . 
that 's a concern of mine . 
i would feel more comfortable in many cases with judges . doing the sentencing . 
i like the idea of juries of your peers in that you get personally more than one person making a decision . 
my question ? 
i 'd agree with that . 
too often i think they are not 
that 's definitely a problem . 
and when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have that is a matter of concern to me too . 
i think that in such cases they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased . 
now i happen to know several judges 
and there is one that i would feel uncomfortable . 
but the other two would give either the plaintiff or the defendant the full benefit of the law . 
and i guess that 's what i am concerned with . 
i , guess i definitely agree with you , 
the same crime gets unequal sentences . 
this is very true . 
i think there is more of an ability for selecting two different juries that would most of the time come up with , the same idea versus whether he is guilty or innocent 
and you do see such uneven sentencing evidence of it in the newspapers and such where it would appear the crimes were very similar 
and the other one was sentenced to life . 
of course a lot of that 's also the ability of the defendant to get a good lawyer . 
is n't that the truth ? 
my mind has gone blank 
you know where he says kill all the lawyers . 
i agree . 
i agree with it 
they will admit to you that they do n't have the benefit of , allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty 
it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument . 
and they are very effective too . 
i have been involved just slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty 
but his attorneys gotten him off . 
the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge . 
so i do n't know . 
this is a little bit of the subject , 
but one thing that i really dislike also that 's new is that i have heard that there are federal sentences , 
what 's your feeling about that ? 
i agree . 
i think taxes are high . 
where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? 
no income tax and no sales tax . 
we tax business eight percent , 
businesses are taxed eight percent 
so we do have a very low tax rate , 
i agree 
i 'm still a student 
so i only work part time , 
so i get a check back 
that 's nice . 
from taxes 
nice to get a refund . 
it is , 
but it 's not much . 
do you think that for whatever taxes we do pay that we are getting value for it ? 
it 's like one arm giving the other a transfusion . 
you know what i mean ? 
because , there 's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there 's a fly paper effect 
there you go . 
and not that much comes back to you . 
i do n't know . 
do n't seem like they are doing much with it , 
there 's plans there 
they have nice plans 
but , they do n't always work 
and then they try to raise taxes more 
but taxes get raise 
so . i do n't know . 
i 'm not really into politics 
i do n't really understand it 
it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend . 
it 's almost like they will spend as much as they 're allowed to collect . 
there would be no figuring . 
you would have a certain amount , 
you would take you total salary 
those who made under a certain amount would n't owe any taxes , 
and then there would be a set amount for however many dependent you have , 
and you would just pay a flat tax . no exemptions , no deductions or anything else after you figure up who 's in your family . 
and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with . 
the could be nice . 
i 'd like to see something like that . 
i think it would be fairer 
and it would put a lot of the tax attorneys our of business 
and i am sure they will fight it tooth and nail , 
it does n't seem fair to me . 
it is n't , 
there is not much out there that is fair , 
that 's for sure . 
i will agree to that . 
i mean for your state . 
do you know what your state income tax rate is ? 
twenty percent ? 
i have no idea , 
my dad does it all for me . 
you just pay it . 
and she works as a waitress 
and she is attending college full time also 
and she sends her taxes to me 
and i figure them up . 
she really has no idea . 
she gets a refund check 
how do you keep up with current events ? 
usually catch the news in the morning . 
what channel do you watch or what station ? 
that 's the one i watch . 
i do n't , 
i am a student 
so i really do n't have much time to read the newspapers and stuff 
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really is n't too great sometimes . 
and i usually go out an buy a newspaper if i 'm interested in any particular one . 
the radio does n't really have much news sometimes . 
the stations i listen to are just mainly music . 
i think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all . 
and it 's more like the news shows is now an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news , because they would always have the wonderful investigative reports is your kid 's bus driver smoking crack , on the way to school ? 
they mainly go with popular topics just not basic news . 
it 's something wrong . 
looks like they 're going more for ratings than for actual news . 
i think probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers 
the farm report . 
farm report and oil reports . 
that 's pretty sad 
or who killed who . 
also i have found that newspapers probably are n't as bad as television . 
read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down 
was that like he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something ? 
and the news covered it hours after it happened 
i just thought that 's kind of cold , 
i have seen that happen lots of times . 
channel x gives you the best coverage 
we were on the scene with our team players 
they were showing these dead people 
it did n't seem like there was much coverage of the story , but just the play on people 's emotions . 
and everything . 
i 've pretty much stopped watching local news totally 
even the national news i just find it to be very watered down , 
very , 
what did you think of the coverage of the war ? 
i found it very one sided . 
did you ? 
it just seemed to lack any sort of debate . 
not saying that we actually should have been there or should n't have been there , 
they kept just showing how great we were doing 
a lot of times the news coverage showed all the guys who did n't get hurt coming home and all the big parties 
if they were going to show that why did n't they show the guys who got really hurt and everything . 
and i really think that in the involvement that the press states that the military basically sets the press , 
what kind of pets do you have ? 
we have one rotten cat . 
one rotten cat . 
it 's my son 's cat . 
i heard a laugh in the background . 
that 's the boys . 
they know i do n't like it . 
do n't you like cats ? 
i like cats . 
this cat is more like a dog . 
he 's a one owner . 
he likes one boy in the family 
and that 's about it . 
that 's odd . 
how does he treat the other people ? 
just stays away or runs usually . 
but he 'll follow my oldest son around . 
when he is in the house , he will come up 
and he 'll jump on his lap , 
did he raise him or something ? 
we bought the cat for him 
and so he 's been the one that spent the most time with him . 
but i 've never owned a cat like that . 
i 've had cats growing up all the time 
and they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody . 
that 's interesting . 
so , it 's a weird cat . 
a lot of people drop off abandoned pets at her house 
and we saw an ad saying it was free , 
so we went down there and picked it up 
and it 's been an excellent dog , 
but it 's my first dog i 've had 
and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work 
so that 's mostly why we got it . to keep her company while i am away at work . 
is that kind of your child right now ? 
right now it is . 
it 's kind of good training . 
we have been trying for kids , 
but right now we have n't had any , 
but it 's pretty good training really , keeps her on her toes . 
have you had dogs before ? 
my brother has . 
we did n't do a lot with them . 
i never felt like it was mine or anything , 
you could n't do anything . 
when i was growing up we always had a dog 
and we had mostly mutts , 
not mutts , but mixes like one or two mix 
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs . 
that 's what we found . 
but , it 's a really good dog . 
i do n't know , 
they seem to listen better or something . 
it 's just an accident . 
from my son 's friend down the street . 
would you ever want a dog in the family ? 
i would . 
and he was just too big for our kids when we got him 
and when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was a pet 
and it was a dog that we 
and he was just too big . 
the kids could n't handle him 
and i was still going to school 
and my wife was working 
and i was working 
and so we just did n't have time to really train him 
so he was too big for the kids to handle , 
so he was just tied up to a post 
i guess it 's kind of an animal shelter 
but he just takes a few the animals in 
and some he destroys 
and some he keeps . 
so we took him up there 
and he ended up keeping him . 
cause he has had him for six or seven years . 
we saw him just about a year ago 
and so we asked him about it one day 
he 's been the best dog i 've ever had in my life 
just goes everywhere with him . 
he would have been a great , great dog . 
he just needed a lot of time . 
how do you feel about gun control ? 
i do n't think that guns should be outlawed 
all you do is to get guns 
it varies from state to state . 
do you even know what the procedures are now ? 
but , it 's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun , especially if you have the money to pay for it . 
and i know that in a lot of states you could be just released from a mental hospital the day before be obviously insane , 
but have your legal right to get a gun . 
. i did n't know that . 
that 's pretty scary . 
so do they want us to say where we feel about it in rating it one to ten . 
i 'd probably say about a five . 
that 's where i would probably be . 
seems like it 's a good safe number to pick . 
i do n't really know how they can really enforce the laws any better 
because i do think that some people need them for protection and stuff 
and i can understand them wanting to have them , 
but then again it 's just all those nuts out there . 
it has ? 
in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the united states . 
so it 's really kind of a complex problem . 
i 'm not really sure how bad it is . 
i 've not really had that many problems with it , 
but apparently we were ranked pretty high up . 
i think we have been ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years . 
but . do you own a gun ? 
i 've thought about getting one . 
i probably would n't get a hand gun . 
i do kind of live in the downtown area . 
that 's true . 
i just do n't understand these people when they decide they 're going to buy a gun to protect themselves . 
they are probably going to miss the person 
and they 're going to shoot through five wall , and hit someone . 
you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of whoever . 
you pretty much stop them . 
then the actual shot does n't go that far , 
a wall will stop it pretty much . 
and my dad gave me a gun 
but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it 
so i finally ended up giving it back to him . 
i said i do n't want it . 
i do n't want to be responsible for it because if you 're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to be responsible enough to go out and learn , i do n't need it . 
that really does scare me . people that have guns 
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person 
that person rushes you . 
and they get it from you . 
and you 're pretty much dead because you 've just told the person that you 're about to kill them then 
set them off . 
and , you basically made it clear to the person that you are a real danger to them 
and then if they manage to get the gun from you their first reaction is going to be stop you . 
that 's why i ended up giving it back to him . 
i thought i do n't want it if i do n't really know how to use it 
and i just did n't want the responsibility . 
did it happen at a cafeteria or something ? 
it just makes you wonder how people get guns . 
i would be scared selling guns to people . 
frank , what type of budget do you or your family have ? 
i do n't know that we really have a budget . 
i have a set amount that i save . 
actually there is a way . 
my wife gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks 
and besides that i have a set amount that i save every month . 
that sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have . 
i am single , 
i do n't know if that 's an excuse for not having a tight budget , 
really do n't need to . 
i do n't need to . 
i am the only that i have to keep track of 
so it makes it a little bit easier . 
that 's right . 
and also i try to save a certain amount each month as well 
and i try to have an idea of what my expenses are 
and i am pretty consistent from month to month 
and whenever that changes i am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it . 
but before we use to have a very strict budget , 
i had four kids 
and we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for this and for that . 
kind of anticipate how much things were going to be . 
i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i kind of fence off areas of my check book . 
for instance , there are certain things that i know come up every so often . 
every six months i have to pay car insurance . 
every six months i have to pay my taxes . 
so i take a set amount . 
i 've got a money market account that i do a lot of saving in 
and i also have got a checking account besides that , 
but , what i do on my money market account , my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month . i will just take two hundred and twenty out 
every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it . 
then when the tax bill comes in i 've got that much set aside . 
and i guess that 's a way of budgeting . 
i guess i kind of do a similar thing . more medium or longer range . 
i just have maybe a targeted amount that i will save for . 
probably within a year i would like to buy a new car . 
so , i kind of have an amount in my mind 
and i am making every effort to put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need for a down payment or whatever . 
cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget . not only for buying them , but for keeping them on the road too . 
we 've got two cars . 
my wife has a car 
and i like to drive pick up truck . 
so , we are on a schedule where i try every three or four years to buy a new one . 
and i am constantly making car payments , 
but i figure that 's got to be the story of my life anyway , is making car payments . 
so i get one paid for 
and actually i am saving up for another one besides 
so it 's kind of a never ending thing , 
but you try to schedule those things so that you 're not paying for two at the same time is what i am saying . 
have you thought about leasing ? 
i have thought about it , 
i do n't use it for my business . 
i see . 
my wife uses hers just for pleasure 
and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away 
i guess . 
typically , if you purchase your own car you tend to make the best returns after you pay it off . 
of course , the longer you keep it beyond that point , the more profitable it is to own it yourself . 
you 're right . 
i have been know to keep trucks or cars for ten or twelve years , 
but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill 
and you got to put stuff in them . 
that 's right . 
mine 's seven years old 
and i think last year that was a rough year for it . 
i had a number of expenses . 
as you get to a certain number of miles , you have to get everything replaced , brakes , shocks and all that . 
so , i just went through that whole set last year . 
i hope that i only have a slow period before i do that again . 
those things can really upset your budget when they come in . 
it 's nice to have a little bit set aside for the unexpected . so that it does n't kill you all in one month . 
what line of work are you in ? 
what 's your view . 
what 's your view ? 
i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns . personally . 
that 's true . 
even if they give it a shot , it 's still going to be black market all over the place , 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know 
i should n't make stereo types , 
it is , 
i just live down here now . 
i 've lived down here a couple years . 
you just live down there ? 
but 
there 's a lot of hunters here . 
i know how you feel . 
and we always use to go out and hunt all the time 
and there 's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons . 
i do n't know . 
i think it 's ridiculous . 
it does n't sit with me very well . 
i do n't know anymore 
and it 's just , you never know who is out there . 
it 's just for self protection purposes 
and then of course there 's the hunting issue , 
that 's good . 
i 'm in program control for a company up here . 
we do schedules , for programs , schedule programs . 
what do you do ? 
you guys do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything 
i have n't had a chance to do any hunting since i 've been down here . 
but i 'd like to go bird hunting . 
that 's something i miss quite a bit . 
but i do n't know . 
that 's right . 
i guess i am about eight or nine . 
i agree with you there . 
no doubt about it 
if they can anyway get it , keep criminals from having guns which they ca n't 
i 'm not for it . 
i guess they passed a couple of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you go to buy a hand gun 
they have a waiting period where you buy one 
and that 's a week 
and then they check you out and make sure you do n't have a record and things like that . 
i think that 's a pretty good idea . 
i do n't know , 
that 's not a bad idea , 
but then again you can always get around that . 
you could go through the black market like you say . 
you always be able to get around 
it 's one of things 
but i do n't know . 
i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled 
just like i 'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon . 
i do n't either . 
i think those have been pretty much banned altogether anyway . 
it kind of takes the sport out of hunting . 
it 's what can you do with that , that you ca n't do in a self protection situation with a seven or a twenty shot twelve . 
you might do the same thing . 
and so it 's like it does . 
it takes the sport out of it . 
for me i would much rather have a bow anytime . 
i have done some bow hunting 
and i get into it 
and i think it 's more of a challenge . 
but i do n't know . 
i guess it keeps the shell makers in business . 
but i do n't know . 
anyway , that 's about where i stand . 
me too . 
i am about the same way . 
and have you eaten yet or whatever . 
you guys central ? 
how is the weather up there ? 
it 's not too good . 
is it ? 
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about ten or twenty degrees 
ice is starting to melt and stuff like that 
i am just up here for the year 
and it 's kind of shocking . 
i get most of my news from newspapers really . 
i do n't subscribe to either , 
but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it . 
how about you ? 
i actually get most of my news coverage off computer networks . 
however , i do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day 
and i read the front page of the wall street journal most every day . 
that 's interesting . 
you said computer networks . 
what sort . 
i am fairly knowledgeable of . 
that 's interesting . 
and it 's picked up and actually available at my office , 
so , it 's , no fee , or subscription either to read at my leisure 
and it 's sort of by category . 
for example so i can read a certain business or topics . 
or is it something that is a little bit different from that ? 
it 's similar to that , 
so , that 's interesting . 
and i thought that was a pretty good way to get news . 
do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of a broader more long term analytical sort of approach ? 
actually not . 
i do n't know how to describe it 
so i 'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense . 
it 's a weekly but not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things . 
i 'd like to say however that i 'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires . 
in what way ? 
i have a problem with their viewpoint 
and i personally think there 's a strong bias in the media . 
you wo n't offend me . 
like a liberal type of bias . 
absolutely . 
after all , who writes . 
people who are journalist who are trained to write 
and that 's a liberal field at least from academia 
they generally make mistake on anything technical at least . 
that 's right . 
even if it 's not technical . if it 's some social thing or whatever . it does n't matter . 
if i am an expert in it , they usually make mistakes which makes me think i 'm not expert in it . 
they 're telling me lies . 
by mistakes , do you mean just honest mistakes 
or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things ? 
i think both . 
by deliberate i mean mistakes of omission or , biased toward a particular liberal view point that they have . 
to give you an example , we will go out of the printing media . 
i know of cases where we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but , with the attempt to give you the impression that what they 're talking about is the same thing they are showing you . which is sort of like a deliberate bias . which is rather disturbing . 
that 's disturbing . 
he does that . 
i have n't really noticed them doing that , 
but whatever , 
but i do n't usually . 
i do n't have access either . although , i did at one time 
i did during the gulf war 
but i guess you would n't . 
if you just watched it during the gulf war , that probably would n't tell you much . 
during that small sample , i would think that everyone was just about the same , except the three networks . 
are you married 
and do you have a family ? 
i am to both questions . 
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances . 
we do . 
basically there 's the expenses that are fixed during the month the ones that come every month 
and we enter those into a spread sheet 
and whatever is left after that we sit down and agree on kind of what sort of range we are generally going to shoot for . 
i see . 
what do you do ? 
that 's basically what we do . 
about every three months or so , we re-evaluate our budget 
and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest 
i work part time at night 
and my husband works full times days 
and so we have four checks , 
but that works out nice because we get paid every week 
and so that does help , 
that helps a lot . 
and then we do n't have a lot extra for extra spending , 
so it 's pretty well ear marked . 
all allocated out . . 
every penny is ear marked 
but we have found that works the best 
in fact , we found it easier to divide the major bills up cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half , 
and divide those up between all , 
all the checks , 
and so we are not taking a huge sum out of one 
and then the next pay check we 're real short 
we found that it 's definitely helped get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses . 
that 's true . 
we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have , 
and it was easy to let things get out of hand . 
we thought it to be really helpful . 
we have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that 
it helps you to focus where your money goes 
and i am sure you felt the same frustration before you got on a budget , 
but you 're wondering my , when you put down all the money that you do bring in 
and then you 're saying , where did all that money go . 
that 's a lot of money , 
where does it go ? 
and we did this . 
we are not real consistent with this , 
but we did it for about a month 
and we wrote down everything that we bought every pay check 
and so we could see where every penny went 
and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend 
and like i say we have n't been real consistent with it . 
we should cause it does help . 
the other thing that we 've found that helps is we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit 
and that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount . and then if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say , it 's gone . 
that sounds like a really good idea . 
and it really helpful . 
have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet ? 
we have n't . 
our initial goal was just to completely retire debt for car payments and credit card debt and all of that . 
we are just at a point where we could start thinking about it 
that 's good . 
that 's a good feeling . 
my husband just graduated from the university a year ago 
so finally we are getting to that point too . 
a student . 
are you still going to school 
do you like ? 
lots of different kinds i guess . 
i like country music , of course 
so i listen to it quite a bit . 
i am more into rock and roll myself . 
they have that type of music , 
but they just have different words 
so , i listen to that too . 
not really , 
and i like rap music . 
do you like rap music ? 
not really . 
not really . 
i can tell we 're together here . 
i have a lot of friends that like country music . 
what kind of rock music do you listen to ? 
do you listen to that really heavy metal stuff 
i have friends that like that . 
what ? 
i 've heard a little bit of it . 
they 're the heavy metal stuff i guess . 
i like her too . 
i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers . 
i 've never actually seen her in concert . 
i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show . 
she does . 
she 's real good . 
so , i like her . 
i like some country music . 
it 's just that i , 
i do n't like the country music that 's like my wife left me , my dog left me , everybody 's left me . 
i do n't like that . 
i like more of the real new ones . 
he 's fine . 
i like them . 
i do n't care for the older the dog left me stuff . 
i do n't even really know who she is . 
but , have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like ? 
but are n't they done with ? 
they are still on tour . 
they have been touring , since the late sixties . 
and i just thought that they done broke up and left . 
they 're still together . 
they 're still making albums . 
i did n't know that . 
that 's interesting . 
cause they are on up there in age , are n't they ? 
but whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement . 
they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players . 
they keep on dying 
and they keep on replacing them 
and the new one 's in this thirties . 
cause they look pretty rough . 
i 've seen picture of them 
they do n't actually look as rough as the rolling stones . 
i do n't know if you saw the tour posters of the rolling stones when they last toured , 
it just looked like they , got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans . 
you know what i am saying 
they come on the stage 
they do n't even know they are there . 
they are just so out of it . 
that . 
so , i do n't know . 
have you seen any concerts lately ? 
and they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste . 
it 's not too new . 
they really did n't propose any solutions . 
but , he had a lot of facts to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down 
and , one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of news print . 
and they could sell it for a while . 
they were able to sell it for some amount per ton 
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling , they 've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away . 
that 's a common problem though . 
we 're doing some here in cash valley , the community here . 
we 've actually got a kind of a nice set up . 
we 've got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it 's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation 
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them . because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside . 
that 's good . 
so one of the real keys to getting recycling for paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . 
and i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days 
and they 're making clothes now that are recycled . 
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government . 
one was environmental protection 
and the other one was i ca n't remember what , 
but the basic idea , it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill 
and the solution that he came up with for plastics , it was really quite amazing , 
he says , the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them . 
he came to the conclusion , plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it 's low weight , but it 's high volume 
so it takes up a lot of space 
and there 's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling , 
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it , produce electricity . 
so his solution was to burn plastic . collect it and burn it . 
it 's carbon 
so that makes sense , 
a carbon fuel of some sort , 
but what about emissions ? 
and it 's more than even paper or something like that . 
there is more energy in it per pound or whatever . 
he did n't deal with that . 
he just said burn it . 
he did n't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that . 
so it 's not very practical . 
it 's interesting . 
i bet that was a good day , at the conference then . 
real interesting . 
did it change anything for you ? 
not too much . 
i got . 
i guess we 're talking about exercise ? 
first of all i have to ask you how old you are ? 
i am quite a bit older than you are . 
but . 
i think exercise is extremely important 
and i do exercise on a regular basis . 
you do ? 
what type of exercise do you do ? 
you do . 
are you familiar with it ? 
it 's a national company 
are they different from aerobics 
or is it the same thing ? 
it 's an aerobic routine . 
you warm up 
and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting slowly and then working up to a high heart rate 
and then you gradually go down again . 
and you do that every day 
i only do it probably two or three times a week . 
the minimum they want you to do is three times a week . 
and this is a club 
or do you belong to a group ? 
it 's called a center 
and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time 
and then you just go in whenever you can . 
so i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning 
do you go with friends 
or do you go alone ? 
i go by myself 
and that 's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me 
and most of my friends that are my age do n't exercise 
or they might play tennis 
and since i am not a tennis player i do n't get that , 
so there are n't many people that want to do that . 
young mothers . 
young women , with small children are the ones that i find . 
what do you do ? 
i really do n't have a routine . 
i like playing basketball . 
and that 's what i do every day . 
do you play every day ? 
pretty much . 
when my wife lets me . 
who do you play with ? 
do you have friends that play with you 
i just shoot around by myself . 
and that 's about it . 
i use to play soccer a lot in high school , 
but when i graduated i have n't done much . 
i do n't have a problem . 
i know i have to do more aerobics , 
but i do n't have a problem with weight . 
i could eat all day and not gain an ounce . 
that 's really good 
and i think that keeps some people from exercising . 
i do n't have a problem with weight either , 
but i think i do n't have a problem because i exercise 
you do exercise . 
people are always saying to me , how do you stay thin 
and it 's because i exercise 
you do it , 
but i also watch what i eat , 
but you 'll come , 
but as you get older you will . 
but i do n't know . 
it might not . 
because everybody 's been telling me that too 
and so far it has n't happened , 
and i just feel like you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get too high . 
i guess i enjoy sports a lot 
so that 's why i 've kept active in that way . 
but you do n't play any other sports but basketball ? 
basketball , 
too bad it 's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby , 
i do that . 
but , do you ski ? 
i use to , 
but it got too expensive , 
did it really ? 
a lot of people do that 
but , i never find the time . 
i had rather do other things . 
they come up here . 
and they ski . 
i guess there 's a place where you can ski , 
i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line . 
is that it ? 
. i 've never heard of that one . 
you 've never heard of that ? 
it 's kind of funny . 
do they exercise much for skiing ? 
i know when i went , you can get sore easily 
you can get really sore . 
i 've talked to people , 
but most of these people ski enough so that they do n't get sore . 
and i am really sore after . 
i am using muscles that i have never used before . 
i did aerobics all the time 
and still i was so sore 
they just started a recycling program here , i think . 
actually , this is my first experience with recycling program 
but instead of just tossing everything away which i always felt bad about i am starting to split stuff up . 
the only disadvantage is that they do n't pick it up at the curb . 
what are they doing up there ? 
there is no curb pick up of any of the recycled products . 
one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers 
and then there 's a deposit program on plastic and glass containers . primarily soft drink bottles 
and so we are able to take it to one of the rehabilitation centers 
the deposit 's only on drink stuff . 
primarily on soft drink , pops and that kind of thing 
so , they induce recycling of plastic and glass , soft drink containers . 
we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well 
so it 's fairly extensive , 
but then again it 's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city . 
are you giving these products to the handicapped group 
and the handicapped group is getting the money 
or are they some home distributing the funds back to you . 
actually there 's the opportunity for both . 
and then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as well . 
that 's very cool . 
and i think it 's mostly cans . 
there may be bottles as well , 
but beer cans , soda cans and what not 
and they bring them up to one centralized location and are able to collect the money from the various beer and soda manufacturers and get more money to these people that desperately need it . 
i guess partly because of our climate . 
but we do n't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people . 
we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing . 
do they do it with news papers as well ? 
they have done it some , 
but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers . 
they are actually at , virtually all of the shopping centers . the shopping malls . 
the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a long term financial plan and monthly budget . 
i do n't know if you are familiar with that . 
and i 've considered using it once myself , 
but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date . 
. i 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then not bother to total it 
and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic . 
so it really helps with that . 
it 's similar problems 
but we just have the one check book 
and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible 
and occasionally we will get behind like you say 
but it does n't really seem to be too tight if we just remember to keep everything up to date and balanced . 
how to you handle that , the long range or medium range planning on finances ? 
actually we have n't had to . until just recently . 
so we needed to start doing more of that just for saving for college and things like that . 
we try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that . 
that 's pretty good if you can do that . 
i know . 
i have a daughter who 's ten 
and we have n't really put much away for her college up to this point 
but we 're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college , 
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall 
and then the money that i will be making this summer we 'll be putting away for the college fund . 
. sounds good . 
my wife worked until we had a family 
and then now we 're just going on the one income 
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to do it . 
kind of enforce the savings . 
our situation is just kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently took on a full time job , 
almost full time . 
that sounds good . 
how about you ? 
i do n't know how many people are getting involved in this 
but that 's interesting . 
or was there another ? 
that is how i got it as well 
and it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in 
so i sent back mail . 
i guess we 're talking about the experiment . 
probably need to try to get back on the topic 
but it 's hard to talk about finances without getting to dollar figures i guess , 
we could talk about some of the long range goals 
what other long range goals do you have besides college ? 
i think , either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point 
i guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that . 
it seems like every year my employer just gives back a little bit your tuition reimbursement . 
they use to reimburse one hundred percent 
and now it 's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class 
how about you . 
what do you do with your budget ? 
what do i do , 
at the moment it 's under chaos . 
i do n't really have a budget per se . 
it 's called living within your means which means at the moment , paying off the visa bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car does n't collapse . 
that 's true . 
but 
i do n't really have a budget at the moment . 
but i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month 
and then i usually do n't exceed that unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if i have car expenses 
and then it goes through the moon , 
that 's sort of a problem . 
so far we are in the clear credit wise 
so , not much on that side of it to add to it . 
we 're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that 
so you can afford to get a house ? 
we 'd like to do that some day . 
we have this dream . 
but , we do n't know how long it will be a dream . 
we 're real happy that we do n't have any debt , 
so we 're stepping real careful and trying to see what 's the best way to save the little bit that we do get on top of expenses every month . 
what do you and your husband do ? 
are you really ? 
and it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have support quota 
and it 's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here . 
and it does n't get switched very easily once you come home . 
i see . 
overseas , where would you be going ? 
how long would you be there ? 
about four years . 
we 're career 
so , we go over seas for four years 
and then we come back for a year . 
we go over four , 
we come back for a year . 
with what church ? 
i know who they are . 
there was a fairly large building that belongs to them . 
are you , active in translation ? 
we will be . 
i was over four years doing language surveying which is the first step . 
and came home and got married 
i always wanted to do translation , 
but as long as i was single and foot loose so to speak it 's easier . 
you do n't have kids hanging around you and stuff . 
true , 
true enough . 
i have a smattering of about ten different ones , 
since i did complete a survey in one area , i 'd switch to the other . 
but in about five i can do better in it . 
and my french is pretty good 
but it 's french 
and french is street french 
and i just picked it up off the street 
but i did n't know what i was saying . 
i never sat there and got a direct translation 
and said something here when i came home and 
and he paled and said i 'm not going to tell you what you said . 
i do n't know what i said to him 
but i did n't ask him either . 
must have been terrible . 
what do you think about putting the elderly in a nursing home ? 
i think that it varies on the individual basis . 
sometimes there is no alternative . 
you may not even have family who are around . 
that 's true . 
so , sometimes it 's not an alternative . 
but i think also , sometimes it can be a benefit if it 's for a short time . 
especially if it 's after an acute illness . 
that 's true . 
i never thought of that . 
sometimes the nursing homes are good for just short periods of time . 
that 's true , 
because too often the acute hospitals are sending them out much faster than what they 're really able to . 
they really are . 
they do n't like to keep them longer than a week . 
so there is some good to it . 
sometimes too , it 's used as a dumb job . 
the families do not necessarily know what to do with them 
what do you mean ? 
and they do n't want to take the responsibility 
so they will put them in a nursing home . 
that 's true . 
so there 's both sides to it too . 
what do you think ? 
and it depends on how sick the person is too . 
what you 're capable of , 
if you have a family to take care of of your own . 
i would personally like it 
if my parents were to get ill , i would like to take care of them at home and with some help . 
that 's not always possible . 
that 's true . 
but to the best of my ability , i 'd like to do it until it gets impossible . 
there 's not a choice , because , it 's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home . 
that 's true . 
but i think nursing homes can be good . 
it just depends on what kind they are . 
you need to check them out ahead of time . 
and then there 's also some that are set up for specialties 
i know some . 
and you need a special nursing home for that . 
you need one that has a unit that 's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around 
and you need people who are trained for that type of problem . 
who know what they 're doing with that . 
so there 's different types of nursing homes i think . 
my grandmother 's not really in a nursing home , but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it . 
and she really liked the idea of moving there . 
she 's not ill yet 
but she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years 
and then she decided that eventually she does n't want her family taking care of her and being a burden . 
she 's very independent . 
so she 's in this nursing home . 
it 's out in the country 
and she really enjoys it right now because she does n't have to wash dishes or cook . 
gives her a little bit of her own independence 
but she still has a security there . 
some support . 
and then there 's also sort of a wing for those people that do get sick 
so if she ever does become ill it will be like family around her . 
that 's right 
and i 've seen some of them like that too 
and also they have a lot of activities going on for the ones who are more active . 
so it 's not sort of like a sick place . 
she loves it . 
she has a great social life 
and she travels 
and it 's in the mountains 
and it 's beautiful 
and i hope that i have something like that when i get older . 
and sometimes those choices can be made in advance 
guy some of my things , i 'd like to have a short work week , 
we can start off there . 
let 's just get started . 
if you do n't want to talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it . 
i just press one then ? 
i think that a short work week is real nice . 
how about you ? 
right now , i 'm just a student . 
i only work part time , 
but i 've work in the job force before 
you just do n't have any time to do anything . 
and then that way everybody would have a three day holiday . 
and that would make a bigger market . 
we 'd have more recreation . 
people would have time to do it . 
there would be less of a stress level . 
we 'd have less crime . 
we 'd have to build less prisons less police force . 
it all makes sense to me . 
although , there may be more crime if people have more leisure time . 
it 's not clear . 
that 's a possibility . 
one of the problems they 're facing now , a lot of people now , is that the small business ca n't offer health insurance 
and it 's too costly 
and what is happening is that they 're on a policy where they have x amount of users in it . 
so they get a specific rate . 
it 's called a group , 
what happens then is that they cancel , because they just ca n't cancel an individual . 
so they have to cancel just life insurance . 
they have to cancel everything . 
what they do is that they cancel the insurance 
and then all the people do n't have any insurance coverage . 
but , i 'm satisfied with my job . 
i 'm an engineering student . 
and i work for my instructor 
and i 'm not a typical student . 
i 'm older . 
i 'm in my thirties . 
and so i have a lot of job experience 
and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants 
and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose 
but in the same token , it 's really enjoyable for me because i do n't have to have nobody breathing down my back 
i just really ca n't deal with that 
what kind of jobs have you done ? 
i do research in computer science 
and i 've just been doing that for a few years now 
my job has most of the benefits i want . 
they send me to conferences for instance , but probably not as much as i 'd like 
a really important thing to me is when they pay for continuing education . 
i get night courses that they 'll cover right now 
and that 's really good 
that 's just great . 
you have what you might call knowledge power 
but if you 're a person that 's doing computer type things and you have the knowledge , you 've revised and revamped the system then you 're vital to the company 
and you get more benefits 
i 'm into computers too 
when you have the knowledge , you 're not going to be let go , 
so , do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time ? 
generally , i do n't think they are . 
my personal opinion is that the politicians are out for their own good because they 're entrenched . 
they do n't ever have to go out and get a real job . 
they just stay in their current job , 
you know what i mean ? 
i agree with both of those things , 
but do you see any way of altering it so that they would become more honest ? 
i think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems . 
but it has to be not just at the national level but at the state and the local level , too . 
i know some senators , 
and i do n't know which ones , 
they 've never had a job . 
they 've never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes . 
i know they pay taxes , 
and i 'm going i do n't understand how they 're supposed to be my servants and yet they 're paid more than i am 
and they work less than i do . 
i think there 's a lot they need to learn when you get there . 
i think that 's true , 
however , i think that 's always been true . 
that 's true of the presidency , too , 
and we seem to be able to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years . 
there is a lot to learn , 
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up . 
i think two years is too short . 
i think it would have to be extended , 
or you would increase the length of each term of a congressman . 
we are n't tackling a massive ballot every four years . 
i 'm just going to vote against the incumbent every time does n't work , 
it 's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states are n't doing it at the same time . 
i think that that 's true , 
but then you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin . 
the world does revolve around d c as far as the politics in this country are concerned , the national politics 
and the c i a is a very large , very high profile agency 
it might only be two hour drive from here , 
but that 's a two hour drive 
and i think it 's a mistake to move large agencies like that 
or is it the f b i . 
i do n't remember , 
i do n't see why it makes a big difference because officially they do n't have any operations within the united states other than administrative . 
that 's officially . 
we all know that that 's not necessarily true . 
but i think that there are advantages to having seniority or , not having a complete turnover every , some small number of years . 
i think there 's an institutional memory that you need to maintain . 
i heard on the radio back a few weeks ago during the incidents where they are n't paying their restaurant bills and they 're bouncing checks all over the place 
one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks . 
how you like new jersey ? 
it 's pretty good . 
you get closer to the coast here , 
i guess it 's fairly industrial ? 
but i 'm about thirty miles west of there 
so you have actually green trees such that you do n't notice that , that other part of new jersey exists . 
you go even a few miles out 
and you got farms and everything 
i do n't know about you , 
but i 've always considered automobiles to be , probably the prime contributor . 
there 's a lot of contributors , 
but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that . 
definitely . 
there are a large number of them on the road . 
they 're all going , 
and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair . 
a big issue is a lot of states do n't have a inspection law 
even where you do have the inspections the inspection is once a year . 
you get the car that 's in the accident 
and muffler falls off or something 
and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that . 
natural gas powered rather than gasoline . 
i 'm hoping that comes along quick . 
i was reading an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that 's going 
it is coming from cars , though . 
i think that 's a contributor definitely . 
go ahead . 
the third world countries are less industrial 
and they want to become industrial 
and that 's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is , that basically they do n't want to have to pay for our mistakes if that makes any sense . 
those are joining arguments , 
but i do n't know , 
that 's kind of an interesting situation there . 
so it 's kind of an interesting situation . 
it 's not a real good one actually . 
you also have the very close related thing of the rain forest destruction which is the main source of what 's clearing out the atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants . 
you do n't get that source of cleansing anymore . 
have you been in big cities a long time ? 
i 've mostly been in the east coast , 
those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard , i would think . 
that 's one of the worst . 
but i 've been pretty lucky , 
and there , you can tell that it 's getting worse . 
there , it 's almost all automobiles because there 's not that much in the way of heavy industry that would be causing it . 
and there 's not that much in terms of public transportation down there . 
there is , 
i watch the national news every day , for one . 
i also read one or two papers a day 
every evening at six thirty i watch the national news . 
i give to the united way 
and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that . 
as opposed to paying for cable . 
i take away a addiction . 
the quality of the news you get off of most sources is pretty low . 
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 
and that 's one of the reasons why i try and get as many sources as possible , 
because if you hear the same story from three different sources , then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on . you would hope , 
but still hard to say that what you 've heard is what really is . 
what , newspapers do you read ? 
i read the local newspaper 
she was unemployed for a while 
so she really needed to look at the help wanted ads 
and so often the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news . 
and , i do n't know , 
and when you read a lot of this stuff , the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so , 
but they say it 's like the sixth grade reading level , 
but i swear it 's at least second or third grade , sometimes . 
pretty low . 
but , i do n't know , 
that 's pretty good . 
when i get a chance , when i 'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it , 
their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than your major network news and that kind of thing . 
i guess he 's leaving , 
one of them is leaving . 
they 're pretty good , too . 
had that invasion or whatever it is . 
sure was . 
but i do n't know , 
i guess a lot of it 's still a lot of hype . 
that was a joke . 
i know , 
i had some visitor 
and i guess that 's good when it 's live , if you 'll really want that , 
but that 's not really providing you news . 
it 's more like a media event rather than reporting . 
but the news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event , which is something that 's good also about c span which i tune into every once in a while . 
that 's kind of boring to me , i think . 
it is , really kind of boring , 
if you do n't watch it there , then you 're going to hear somebody else 's canned report , somebody else 's view about it 
i guess that 's true . 
but , one of the ways that i get information is every day when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this thing , 
it 's free inside the company , 
it 's called intellect 
i 've actually read the actual articles , 
i thought it was supposed to give a recording , 
but i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for my wife and for me 
and i . 
all i do is keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month , 
but i doubt i do it more than three times a year . 
do you use a computer ? 
i work with them all day , 
i 'm in computer science , 
yet i do everything on paper . 
i do n't even use a calculator for the stuff i 'm doing because it 's all pretty round numbers . 
mine is really simple , because i got all our bills paid off when he was a marine , 
and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off , 
so really the only bills i have is rent , utilities , insurance , 
so they come in , 
i pay them , 
and that 's it , 
that 's about the extent of it . 
i do n't really have this major budget or anything . 
just real careful with the money what little we have , 
that 's what i do . 
it 's pretty straightforward . 
i ca n't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making fancy budgets . 
it seems like if you 're getting to that level , you 're not in real good control . 
i 've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt , 
you buy something on credit 
and you pay twice as much for it when you get done 
actually i like using credit cards for everything , but just paying off the bills because that way it 's a record of everything 
and i do n't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month . 
i do n't have too many weaknesses , 
but i found out a credit card was one of them , 
it 's so much easier , if something 's on sale if you 're a woman and you 're a sale person , 
it 's it 's on sale , 
let 's go grab it , 
and if you do n't have the money , then use a credit card , 
so , i got rid of them credit cards . 
i guess if that 's a weakness , that 's a good thing to do . 
that was my weakness . 
it was n't bad , 
i did n't have thousands of dollars and like that , 
i just learned that that was n't for me . 
but i , self-employed , 
i have my own little cleaning business type thing , 
do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that 
it 's not hard , 
i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i 've made and what it 's going to have to go for that month 
and it 's not that hard . not at all . 
that 's good to know . 
i always do my own income tax . 
do you ? 
i do n't understand the idea of paying somebody to do it . 
it seems like it 's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it . 
all you got to do is read the little book they send 
just the form . 
and a lot of them . 
it 's dumb . 
but i do n't , 
so , i do n't mess with it . 
but , i do n't use a calculator either . 
i do n't trust myself with using a calculator or computer , too much stuff like that because i want to make sure that i keep on top of the numbers and understand what 's going on . 
i do n't have that many , things to add up 
i know too many people who use a calculator 
if they make a mistake , they find out two months later because they were n't paying attention . 
and they have a number that you can call in , 
and i always call in once every other week or so 
and i will check off what checks have cleared 
do you do that ? 
we have the same thing . 
you do too ? 
and i always check them off and check my balance and my book because i always want to know exactly what i have . 
i do that real often . 
i do that , 
what are your views on capital punishment ? 
i have ambivalent feelings because i do n't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is . 
and it 's eating us alive budget wise 
are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state ? 
we do practice capital punishment , 
but the nature of the courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it 's a very long haul before anybody 's ever executed . 
and then , i was reading in the paper just this morning that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them . because of all the costs of the appeals and all that . 
i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people who would see it . 
that would be the intent of it . 
but i 'm not sure how successful that is . 
quicker maybe , 
what kind of work do you do ? 
i 'm a research engineer , 
i 'm a school principal . 
elementary school . 
and i see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do 
course , you could n't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there 
but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids , we 'd have fewer decisions to make . down the road . 
that 's probably true , 
but , pumping more money into the school system is a good thing , 
i 'm not talking about just in the school system . 
i see . 
i 'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared . 
i know the institutions do n't work that well , 
but it 's a bad day because i get all these kids through my office . 
five hundred of them are good , solid kids 
and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible . 
so that 's a difficult situation . 
and you just see those kids going down the road . 
but some of them have already been in youth centers . and that kind of thing , 
and i 'm not talking about necessarily in the school system , 
i 'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action . 
i think that 's one reason we have problems in schools , 
and some of them are our problems , 
but a lot of it 's because everything society wants , we are supposed to do . 
but that 's another subject 
that 's probably true . 
i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody . 
i guess that 's not an easy solution . 
there 's no easy solution for that . 
i do n't know that there is an easy solution , 
that 's true . 
i 'm sure it is , 
statistically , that 's true . 
certainly capital punishment is n't going to solve a lot of problems 
are you for it ? 
i 'm for it in some cases . 
in certain crimes . 
what kind of crimes would you use it for ? 
any mass murderer type individual . 
somebody elected that recently . 
i read about that . 
and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it . 
i think we definitely need more of it , definitely . 
i 'd agree , too , 
for certain . 
because , the country 's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients . 
do they cover diseases like that ? 
i think they cover aids , 
and if you are , not only will they not give you a policy , 
there 's a database of people that have tested positive , 
so you 'll never be able to get insurance ever again . 
but that 's why they should have started doing stuff before . 
still since it 's dormant for such a long time , there 's still probably a lot of people who are draining a lot of money right now , 
that 's a good one . 
i really do n't . 
i did a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff , 
and really we 're not doing much at all , 
most of what gets raised , it 's not really federal movement , 
most of what gets raised , gets raised by conscious communities and things like that . 
private organizations . 
and , they get donations from the community and from corporations around the city for aids research and that kind of thing 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know what the likelihood of that is , 
i would probably agree with that . 
so do you think it 's more important to spend money on research or for support of people ? 
that 's a good question , fish . 
i do n't know , 
and it 's really not necessary until the , disease reaches its final stage becomes really infectious 
and i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to try to understand what they 're going through and everything and try to understand that they do n't have to be just completely cut off from the community 
and , i do n't know , 
i guess i think that , research is the most important , just because it really needs to come to an end . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know , fish . 
what do you think about that subject ? 
my feeling is that it 's really being used today , 
it really is n't doing any real good purpose for anything because it 's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal . 
i think i 've seen some statistics that say that it 's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life . 
because you 've got all the prison expenses , plus all the legal expenses . 
committing them mostly is either crimes of passion or at the moment 
or they think they 're not going to get caught 
it 's kind of like the aids phenomenon , 
i do n't need to care about this . 
i 'm never going to get caught . 
but you also have to think whether it 's worthwhile on the individual basis , 
by putting him in prison for life , there is still a possibility that he will get out again . 
one way or another . 
whereas if you kill him , there is not that possibility . 
but the other side to that is , if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , and somehow redeem himself . 
i do n't think he could ever redeem himself , 
but in some cases . 
the other problem with capital punishment you run into is , what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent ? 
there are cases where twenty , thirty years after the fact of getting evidence , especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence , then , i 'm sorry , 
guess we killed the wrong guy . 
once you 've made a decision that way , it 's a little difficult to go back on it . 
you can apologize nicely , 
where are we going to impose , 
and , again , i do n't thing these people care . 
they risk their lives every day . 
and , they seem that the profit margin 's so high that , the risk is almost not there . 
we 're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something . 
i think it 's mainly , people they get the vengeance of it . 
and the big thing down there was , we have capital punishment , 
it 's lot of blacks . 
also a lot of young people . 
and i think when you listen to the victims ' families and things , they 're always talking about feeling justified or feeling like they 've gotten something out of it , 
my thought has been , once the guy has been imprisoned , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed , it should n't make any difference to the victim 's family . 
obviously , if someone of mine who has close died , i 'd probably feel differently , 
but the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society . 
and also by keeping them in prison , you do have the possibility of making restitution . 
you will work your prison job 
and any money you earn will go to the victim 's family . 
and there , more and more things like schizophrenia 
you really get back to the question of is someone responsible for their actions . 
i think on some of it , you have to say someone 's responsible for his actions . 
society made me do it . 
let 's see , 
mine 's pretty easy actually . 
and , although i ca n't afford it right now , i would just love to have one . 
regardless of that fact . 
it 's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money . 
and it seems to just blow the competition away . 
it terms of handling acceleration , 
handling , power , everything . 
it just got the top rating . 
let 's see , 
and it dominated over all of them . 
i like the styling 
and , i seen a few of them actually race 
and they seem to be really good cars for it . 
ca n't afford it . 
so you 're talking about ones in a lower end , price range . 
i 'm a graduate student 
and , let 's face it , 
i do n't make any money 
you can wait till you graduate 
and you 'll have plenty of money , 
you can buy whatever you want . 
we 'll see then . 
right now i 'm stuck , 
it 's fast , but unreliable 
and trying to get it prepared for racing . 
would you use that for city driving and racing ? 
i 'd use it for both . 
what kind of track is that ? 
just a set up a lot of times 
tight turns , hard acceleration . 
and it 's interesting . 
i would guess so . 
what are you thinking about buying ? 
the legend . 
and i was there this summer 
they have the whole philosophy , 
of course , 
of course they are . 
they want you to buy their car . 
it was interesting . 
and it was amazing how they were completely opposed . 
and no two of them are alike . 
so it 's completely opposed . 
i do n't know , 
which do i like better , 
it 's not realistic . 
unless , it 's a toy . 
let 's face it . 
what kind of driving you 'd want to use it for ? 
just work , short trips . no heavy mileage . 
so it 's pretty minimal . 
that 's cool . 
lasts a long time . 
that 's mainly what i 'm looking for . 
that 's good . 
they 're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things . 
the factory was nice 
i think something on the order of a three series , it 's probably different . 
once you get up in the five series and higher , then , all your repair costs go up significantly . 
probably . 
i can imagine that . 
i think they 're a necessary evil . 
i wish the government would operate on the same premise that businesses operate on 
and that is you do n't spend more than you bring in . 
you spend what you have 
i think that , the general idea is to spend , during a time of recession for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy , 
the way they 're running it now , they 're running it under a deficit spending while we 're not under a recession , 
so there 's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we 're running , 
so that 's kind of a basic thing of economics keep spending , keep going into debt , 
so , i guess the question was more like do you get what you pay for . 
it just depends . 
roads are very expensive commodity 
and so is utilities they supply and police and fire department , 
they need to make a living . 
so , i think for many years we 've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are to a great extent , public servants , 
we have not paid them really what they 're worth in what they contribute to society . 
i agree with that . 
i guess , 
i 'm a student right now 
and i do n't make a whole lot of money 
i go to a state sponsored school 
so i guess i 'm kind of in debt because i do n't been paying taxes all that long . 
my parents however , have contributed to that for the education side of it and everything , 
but i usually end up getting money back . 
you 're very fortunate . 
i am . 
i need it , too , 
we just try not to pay any more in than we have to , 
we pay in a substantial amount . 
we do n't regret paying taxes . 
we do think that sometimes we have a reverse of a regressive tax , a progressive tax . 
and progressive tax does not give people incentive to make more money , 
and what i mean by that , the more income you make , the more tax you pay . 
more taxes you pay . 
it should be a flat percentage 
and that percentage ought to be an equitable amount . 
and i totaled them all up 
that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there even though there 's taxes on different things . 
but there 's a lot of taxes you pay that you 're not even aware of that you 're paying like when you buy a tire , you pay a federal excise tax . 
there 's a lot of hidden taxes . 
you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your tank . 
the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay , i guess . 
but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes . 
there was that , 
one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the tax codes they have now and implementing a flat percentage , something like that . 
if you implemented a flat percentage , it would encourage people to make more money 
and what people need to understand in my opinion , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . 
and , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough to say , here 's my break point , 
i 'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs . 
based on that , who do you think you 're talking to , 
you 're talking to an employer . 
with the issue of trial by jury i actually found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting . 
actually , i agree that that 's an interesting thing . 
i believe for civil suits it 's not unanimous , 
but for criminal suits it 's unanimous by federal law ? 
i actually thought i 'd read that , too 
i wonder , 
the difference could be that for state felonies versus federal felonies that things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , 
do you think that that 's an unreasonable requirement that they be unanimous ? 
i 'd be curious as to what the requirement for an acquittal is . 
but i do n't know whether you need a unanimous vote of not guilty to acquit . 
that would be an interesting change . 
so , i think , if anything , it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision . 
i 'd agree with that . 
but i 've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury , although i 've been out here and registered for about five years . 
actually i thought that that would be very interesting thing to do . 
i would like to do that . 
i 've been out here twenty some years 
and i 've been called three different times , 
but i 've never actually even made it into the jury box . because there have always been a number of people 
and i 've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions . 
i also think that would be really good . 
and in fact , i 'm not sure that that 's any more liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else . 
the one thing that i know does seem to happen from people i 've talked to on this , is that in the situation you just said where it 's nine to three , or some such number , that there starts being a lot of peer pressure going on 
and in some cases if it 's a long trial , the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . 
i 'd read one book that , went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases looking at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors based on the deliberations . 
some of them did say that when they were the only one left opposing the verdict everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict . 
i understand . 
i think of the movie twelve angry men . 
you ever seen that movie ? 
once . 
and he 's the one , 
i believe he was opposed to the conviction 
and he held on 
let me ask you the question , 
do you have a monthly budget , or a long term budget that you stick to ? 
right now i 'm in college 
and i 'm on work study 
and so my budget comes from my dad 's help . 
he helps me out a lot 
and i get paid monthly , 
so that 's kind of hard to have a budget . 
my mother does n't get paid much money , 
so her budget is just planning for i r a 's . 
i see , 
i see . 
i 'm kind of in a different situation , 
but i went through that , too , when i was in school , 
but i was working to get through college and , trying to make it through that , 
but i 'm married and have a couple of children 
and we have to pretty much stick to a budget . 
i 'm on a salary 
so i do n't get any overtime or anything like that 
but , we have a fixed income 
and we have to make sure that every dollar we have is spent accordingly 
and what we try and do to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have the house payment , 
we have the insurance premiums utilities and so forth 
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we 're going to spend and set that money aside , 
and we also try and set aside money for savings , set aside money for the kids ' college education , the future and set aside money for bonds 
and we also set aside an emergency fund 
because we 've been married for about ten years 
that sounds good . 
and we find out that no matter what kind of budget you stick on , there 's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house , that you have to have money for and not enough to go and to take a loan out , but you have to have money for . 
whatever 's left over is discretionary income , that we use for the rest of the month , 
and it 's worked out very well . 
it 's helped us , so that we have n't been too long on the month and too short on the money 
and try and stick with that 
that 's good . 
and , nice thing about it , my wife is excellent in that 
we both work together , 
we both have a budget , 
and we stick to it 
and there 's no surprises in that . 
with two kids , that could be hard . 
actually i have four kids . 
four ! 
i said a couple of kids , 
i guess i should have specified , 
i have four little boys , 
four boys . 
you bet . 
you bet . 
it 's just me and my sister . 
and my parents divorced three years ago 
and my sister had gotten through college , 
but i was still in high school , 
and my mother paid for a lot of my sister 's college while my parents were together 
and then before the divorce she had saved for my college . 
but when we had the divorce , she just did n't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house . 
so now my dad 's paying for all of my college . 
i 'm a music major , 
what year are you in in college ? 
i 'm a sophomore . 
you 're a sophomore , 
you have a few more years . 
i 'll probably have about , two and a half years left . 
good for you . 
good for you . 
i imagine it is a little difficult to stick with a budget , during school and so forth . 
it sure is . 
i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks 
and i do n't spend over that . 
and sometimes that 's a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff you 've got to work on , too . 
there 's always music books to buy . 
lab fees and all , 
you 're not a starving artist , yet , are you ? 
i do n't plan on being a starving artist . 
that 's why i 'm in college . 
there 's enough of those in the world ? 
that 's usually because they 're not real educated . 
they ca n't afford to have a really good job . 
who 's not very well educated ? 
the starving ones . 
there 's enough out there that if you 're educated enough , then you can make money . 
that 's true , 
that 's true . 
i found that out . 
so that 's why i 'm planning and preparing for the education of my children , also try and set that money aside . 
what did you major in ? 
you know plenty about planning a budget . 
how many kids do you have ? . 
i think we 're going to talk about parents spending time with their children . 
so this is the big issue with us . although i do n't recall marking it on my little things to talk about 
but , perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time 
anyway . 
you do n't have children ? 
but you 're married ? 
we 've been married for two and a half years . 
we 've been trying for about two years 
but no luck yet . 
hopefully , 
i know we 're not supposed to do this long distance 
but actually i 'm getting a call . 
i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting . 
could i ask you to hold one minute ? 
i 'll be right back . 
excuse me , just a moment . 
they 're going to get mad . 
she had another call . 
i 'm so sorry . 
do you have a lot of activities with your kids ? 
i do n't want this to be a unilateral conversation 
but 
we do . 
both my husband and i work 
and our children are sixth , fourth , and third grade . 
and the school years are wonderful , 
they 're just wonderful . 
the kids , they are real people 
and they are interesting 
and , they have all their own activities 
and i think as parents we really enjoy them in our personal situation 
our children have not yet decided to rebel . 
so they 're pretty good kids ? 
i 'm sure that 's coming though . 
but , they are wonderful kids . 
i guess i can talk about us . 
we had nine kids in our family . 
we had eight boys and one girl . 
you had eight boys and one girl ? 
he owned his own business 
so we worked with him most of the time . 
so that 's how we spent most of the time with him . 
that was a dead giveaway ? 
i came from a family of five . 
i had four brothers , 
the only girl . 
and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled . 
i never felt spoiled . 
in fact i always thought my toys were destroyed . 
i was going to say , my sister was n't spoiled very much . 
usually busy fighting for survival . 
i do n't know . 
it 's an interesting problem . 
i 'm a pediatrician . 
my husband is a physician , 
so i talk to parents about this a lot . 
i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home need very early to come to grips with any guilt , that they feel and decide what 's best for them and their family . 
and i feel when my children were very young , i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing . 
and i long ago decided i 'm a better mother because i work outside the home . 
i really believe that . 
and it has helped us to afford some things for our children that we could n't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age , 
and i think our kids are real secure . and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female 
so i know it sounds like a rationalization 
but i really think it 's true for our family , 
and i think it has worked very well . 
it 's like you said to each his own . 
and we 're planning on having my wife stay home . 
there 's no question , 
i think that 's really the best . 
if a woman is happy doing that , 
i hate to put it quite that way . 
and i would not have been real fulfilled . 
i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child . 
it 's wonderful to be a mother 
but i like the way i did it . 
i sort of worked half time . 
i had very flexible hours . 
i nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year 
and you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to mothers . 
and i think we choose very , very carefully the alternative situations that we had them in . 
again , i know it sounds like a rationalization , 
but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children 
and they learn to share . 
they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention 
but at the same time we have to be sure they are secure . 
i think that helps . 
that 's good . 
sounds like you have a handle on it . 
your wife , does she work right now ? 
not right now . 
we just moved down here . 
you 're still trying to dry out ? 
that 's no problem here . 
we really liked it up there 
do you ever think that there 's a crime that 's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just does n't deserve to live anymore ? 
that 's a good question . 
there was a point where i would have said , no , that no one would deserve to die for a crime that he committed . 
i ca n't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people . 
and try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment . 
but he 's against the death penalty . 
but he said that he would want to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if they did something to his wife . 
but , even in that situation he would hope that there would be people around him who would keep him from doing the things . 
it 's a question of your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response . 
and he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when people wanted to see if he was going to go for a gut level reaction . 
is it designed for punishment ? 
perhaps not in the manner that we do it 
but in theory it fits in . 
if you put someone to death you obviously , ca n't reform them . 
that 's true . 
the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent 
and i really do n't agree with that . 
i do n't think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say , i was about to kill and dismember this person 
but if they catch me they 're going to kill me 
so i better not do it . 
i just , do n't think that it works that way . 
i do n't think it 's done . 
i do n't think we run it as a deterrent . 
people say that , 
but if it was really a deterrent i think horse thieves in the old west they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while . 
and if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent , i would think that it would be public . 
i do n't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it . 
say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime , had to sit and watch and see a guy burn or , something or shot by a firing squad or something like that . 
i do n't know if that would really work that way or not . 
there 's a lot of violence , 
i did forget to ask you . 
what is your name by the way ? 
criminal courts ? 
and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race . , 
the jury that 's trying the officers in that case , is an all white panel . 
and there 's been a lot made in the local papers of that , fact . 
i see . 
they have . 
they have . 
they moved it up to the county north of here . 
and there 's still quite a bit of publicity obviously , 
that videotape was just horrible . 
it was everywhere . 
and i think it would be very difficult to find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on . 
i agree with you 
but i ca n't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of , appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff . 
i 'm kind of torn on this issue . 
it 's like they 're saying on the one hand he 's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways true . 
but on the other hand , it 's also saying that white jurors are not going to convict . 
based on fact . 
how interesting . 
what 's the prevailing thought within the community ? 
what the news media is going to make of it , 
but what about the community ? 
i guess it depends on who you talk to . 
i have n't talked to a whole lot of black people on it 
on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing , these people beating the heck out of this guy . 
you 're going to have it just about anywhere . 
but that 's interesting . 
what about the judge who 's hearing the case ? 
is he going to , be a good adjudicator ? 
i do n't know , 
and again there 's something else along those lines . 
i do n't know if it 's got as much notoriety 
and she had a dispute , black girl . 
she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the owner of the store . 
the criminal case went up 
and the judge gave the woman who shot the girl practically a suspended sentence . 
she gave her no time in jail all of these things 
to get that judge recalled i would think . 
that 's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences . 
it would make life easier . 
it would . 
the whole world would know what you were facing . 
i used to work in a day care center . 
i worked in all the different areas of the day care center 
i did not work there long because i could n't handle the treatment that the children got , 
and they would be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left . 
i think if you do day care centers you should make frequent checks to check in on them when they 're not expecting it . 
because they do , do things differently when you 're not around , 
i know , 
the things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have . and how many kids they have and how they break it up . 
because we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in . 
it was a really good one , 
and in fact , it worked out for us because we kind of bartered . 
my wife did artwork for them 
so we got our day care free . 
but they did n't have enough teachers 
this one was set up good . 
they had two teachers to every room . , sometimes three . 
and they had a good system so when you walked in , everything looks cool . 
they did not show them care to these small children who are being left . 
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other , 
he said you are going to have every child in here wanting you to pick them up . 
and i said , no , 
what is your problem . 
because i think that 's one thing that was important . 
they did , 
they really did separate them well . 
it was just the teachers themselves . 
their system , 
but their system was great 
but the caring just was n't there . 
the one woman that did the babies . i worked with her 
and she was fabulous . 
she loved them babies , 
and she loved them and cared for them . 
but every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and would make me a nervous wreck , 
but if they do n't reach out and touch the kids , then that does n't do any good . 
they 're just there going through this routine , which is lousy . 
the other group that we had was kind of interesting . 
the other one we went to it was a husband and wife team 
and we knew them from other associations 
but it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one , 
and i think she 'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff , 
he would laugh with the kids and play with the kids 
and it was kind of interesting to see that it was actually the man in the group that did that side of it . 
you do n't see that much . 
so they had a really nice balance . 
we liked that one . 
that 's cute . 
but they also did some of the teaching things 
obedience was important . 
that has to be with a day care center . 
you probably heard where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself . 
i 've never heard of that . 
that 's a new one , on me . 
i ca n't remember what they call it actually 
but you just stand them in front of a clock 
and they have to stand there , 
it looks like it 's just about as volatile as it usually is . 
what do you think , mark ? 
i agree . 
i think there 's definitely been some changes , 
and i think the , end of the soviet union will definitely have its effect on the situation . 
and then we 'll see what happens when they 're not funded quite as much . or supplied with arms the same way . 
that just seemed to me to be a phenomenal demonstration of restraint , 
i see . 
they would have had to fly through two enemies . 
i see . 
that 's true . 
they can , 
but i think that , we chose to have our official feelings hurt . 
i think that in the past we 've allowed lots of things like that to happen . 
i think there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests . 
may have been . 
i 'm not saying that that 's not the case . 
over what probably wo n't accomplish much for him politically . 
it does n't look like we 're getting ready to do much more in there . 
even at this point . 
do you , think we ought to back off on our support of the country 
what 's our topic ? 
taxes . 
taxes . 
do we pay too much ? 
do we ? 
what do you do ? 
it all depends really on what kind of bracket you 're in . 
my tax bracket is pretty high up there . 
i generally pay the maximum tax bracket . 
and i think that we 're paying too much 
because i do n't have any children . 
and i pay a lot of property taxes . 
i do n't use an awful lot of city services . 
it 's like i have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes . 
how about you ? 
do you pay too much ? 
i ca n't really complain . 
i 'm a student , 
and i 'm going to get back most of what i pay in taxes 
and , one of my parents is still claiming me . 
when you go out into the working world it changes quickly . 
i 'm sure . 
you look at your paycheck 
and you go , where did it all go . 
have you 
have you been out working and then gone back to school 
or did you go directly from high school into college ? 
i did work for some time 
but i did n't make enough money to really make , too much of a difference . 
to worry about it . 
have you been active in politics concerning this ? 
have you worked on political action committees or something like that ? 
i have n't . 
i have n't done any of that type of work myself . 
congress has added too towards the members bank there , 
there 's a bank that they all bank with , 
and i guess it went defunct recently . 
and one of the congressmen has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks . 
and we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those bad checks , 
no interest , 
no repayment schedule . 
and it 's causing quite a stir up here , because we 're so close to d c anyway . 
it 's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur . 
i think we pay too much . 
and i look at my paycheck 
let 's see . 
and then they charge me sales tax 
and they charge me gasoline taxes , 
taxes . 
and they charge me all these others , 
and it 's just too expensive . 
i ca n't believe that 
you know what i mean ? 
have you used student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government ? 
i have n't . 
my father pays for my tuition . 
so i have n't made use of that . 
what are you studying down there ? 
physics . 
physics . 
that sounds like a fun field . 
everybody says that . 
scientific . 
heavy science . 
are you in the particle research or anything like that 
or is it more applied physics ? 
i have n't gotten too terribly much into my major yet . 
actually the degree i 'm getting is physics . 
there 's a different one for applied physics 
so i guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied . 
maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that 's come rolling towards , whatever it 's rolling toward . 
i doubt about that . 
are we pretty steep compared to most countries ? 
actually , i do n't think we are . 
i do n't think so either . 
are you working right now ? 
i am . 
what kind of work do you do ? 
i 'm doing basically system design work and implementation work for the speech group , here . 
is that how you heard about this thing ? . 
actually through electronic mail . 
me too . 
i 'm a co-op student 
so i work and go to school about halftime . 
and i really do n't have any job benefits to speak of . 
i do n't know , 
they just kind of forget us on that end . 
we do n't really have any vacation or sick days or health care or anything really 
what about you ? 
i 'm research stuff here now 
so they have okay , benefits package . 
it 's not quite as good as industry 
but one of the significant benefits here is that you can take up to two courses a semester , 
and they pay for the classes . 
they do that if you 're research here 
then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters 
and i think that they might pay for that . pay for the classes and stuff 
but i know they 'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage . 
they 'll let you work halftime if you want to finish , 
if you want to , do it quickly . 
they 'll let you , decrease your number of hours by any percentage just about 
and then , i think of course with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due 
so that will probably help out . 
but , do you get any kind of health care type stuff ? 
so i do n't know in terms of other things , other benefits other than sort of monetary 
we do . 
we have to contribute a certain amount to it . 
i think that 's a pretty important part of it there because that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems . 
i 'm still covered with my dad 's health plan where he works , 
but it would definitely be something to look into once i get my own . 
that 's a whole other topic to begin with too 
they have . 
but you are right . 
i really agree that , that 's pretty important . 
i 'm learning and stuff because , i 'm in school . 
but there 's some weird law where student employees working for the government do n't have to pay social security tax . 
though that 's about , five percent right there 
that 's a big win . 
that 's about the only real bonus 
so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate how much i get paid real because if i was working somewhere else i 'd have to pay an extra five percent , or so . 
and they 've just raised the income caps on social security to the point where you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying that as well . 
in case you ever need to bail out . 
around here it 's like we pretty much work from project to project with different sponsors . 
i work for an insurance company 
juries will decide the guilt or innocence , 
but then they leave the awards up to more learned people . 
that seems to make sense 
each individual jury really does n't have any perception of what if you will the going , award should be for a certain type of case within some kind of range . 
when you get one way out like that 
they 're not going to sit there and lose money . 
if they are losing money , then they 're going to raise rates . 
so it all comes filtering down to us all individually . 
and granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged . 
how do you feel about setting for example , some incident where someone loses a limb . 
do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm , a dollar figure for losing different body parts ? 
i do n't know . 
but i do n't know that you can necessarily put a value on somebody 's limb arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases . 
i think maybe you look at the age of the person and their station in life and , how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up with that . 
i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there . 
and that can be part of continuing education , maybe for judges . 
i do n't know . . 
that 's true . 
if it 's a company , you know that they 're insured . 
i think those should be uninsurable . 
i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that did the damage . 
as opposed to the insurance paying the bills , 
for honest mistakes where they 've done something and something happens . 
one of their employees causes damage or something . 
that 's what they buy insurance for . 
do they get insured from other insurance companies 
or how does that work ? 
i was just talking about any company . 
let 's just say a lumber manufacturing company 
and somebody is on the premises 
and he pushes the wrong button 
and he drops a load of lumber on somebody 
insurance should pay for that . 
but in some instances you 're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance , if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings . 
i 'm not talking about any loss . 
the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person 's actual injuries and what they are due . 
and then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is usually a lot less . 
lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too . 
so again , it never really penalizes , the company doing the wrong . 
they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to . 
i 'm not talking about your isolated occurrences , 
i 'm talking more about the thing that they know , 
maybe they 're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there 
and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that . 
then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket . 
before a couple of years ago , i had a very narrow view of nursing homes 
and it was more like a funeral home . 
and i went to one 
and it just had a very good activities director . 
and now i do n't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore . 
but i certainly would n't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort . 
i have a sister that is in nursing school 
that sounds good . 
i 've heard the name 
and that 's about all . 
and she 's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes . 
and my sister 's real interested in that and getting into that side of nursing . 
that 's one problem with the nursing home environment . 
the elderly , even out of the nursing home , are very open to abuse . 
they 're not completely up on what should be going on or what 's not going on . 
and it can be pretty sad . 
i 've had a grandmother who had a stroke . 
and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died . 
and it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she could not do very much for herself after the stroke . 
and the nursing home was the best facility to put her in besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work 
you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time . 
it 's a necessary evil i think . 
it sure is . 
and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive . cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older . 
and the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes . 
my grandfather passed away several years ago . 
i was much younger . 
but he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life 
and someone visited him every day . 
my grandmother did . 
but if she could n't , someone visited him every day . 
it was in a very small town nursing home . 
and people did n't get paid much there at all . 
they did n't care about what went on . 
and the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that would n't get met because they were just old people . 
it 's like a newborn baby . 
and nurses get so worn down . 
the elderly are very complaining because they remember the way that things used to be . and remember being able to do things for themselves which they no longer can . 
and they feel pretty helpless . 
and it , very , very hard for them to accept that . 
we just moved my grandfather into , not a nursing home but a transitional type facility . 
is it like a retirement center ? 
more of a retirement home . 
he 's got his own efficiency apartment . 
and they provide one meal a day . 
and the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him . 
but they do have group activities going on . 
how 's he handling that ? 
what were you saying ? 
i think we 're started now . 
do you want to go ahead and start ? 
i have n't really been up to date on a lot of music . 
i 've been in school 
and i have n't really gone out , and bought any or listened to much on the radio except for classical 
you like classical music ? 
i like classical music . 
i like rock and roll . 
i like country and western . 
i like all kinds . 
i like different things about each one of them . 
i like most of them except for country music . 
you do n't like country ? 
i think i might like dancing to it 
but i do n't like listening to it . 
you know what i mean ? 
what 's the old country music like ? 
this stuff , makes you cry it sounds so sad . 
that 's the kind you like you mean ? 
sometimes i do . 
not all the time . 
i guess i like the blues a lot 
and i guess you could say it 's similar as far as the way they do it . 
and i do too . 
i also like jazz . 
me too . 
except heavy metal 
and most rap i do n't like . 
you 're about like i am then . 
and i can barely watch anymore because they have this heavy metal stuff on there 
and i ca n't like that . 
i like groups like that . 
i even like guns and roses , some of their stuff . 
but some of these groups now like slaughter . 
i really have n't listened to that . 
some of them are just really rough . 
i 'm surprised you did n't go to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff 
i used to a long time ago 
but since i 've started back into school now , i have n't really done that much . 
i 've been pretty busy . 
so 
i have n't . 
i used to go out and dance a lot 
but i do n't do that anymore either . 
i see . 
are you married at all ? 
i 've just been real busy with lots of other things . 
how old are you ? 
you went to school for awhile and quit . then went back . 
i went to school and got a degree 
and then i worked for awhile . 
and then i started back a year and a half ago . 
changed directions . 
how old are you ? 
i guess we 're the same age then . 
and i did n't really start getting into music until i went to college because my parents did n't really have music in the house . 
put it that way . 
were they religious ? 
i see . 
i 'm always behind . 
i 'm never really up to date on all that stuff . 
but i know what i like when i like a sound . a certain kind of sound , 
my parents were very musical . 
my mother had a piano in the house . 
my father likes country western music . 
so that 's what he grew up listening to . 
and he 's always liked it 
so he likes that . 
and my mom always liked that kind of stuff . 
i grew up listening to that stuff . 
but i could see why you were kind of sheltered from music . 
i do play the piano . 
so do i . 
what songs does he play ? 
he sings that . 
i 'm not very good at remembering the titles , 
the titles and artists . 
but i can remember the song . 
do you get cable ? 
but . 
i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos . 
i like watching that kind of thing . 
have you ever head of her . 
she 's not rock 
i have n't heard her . 
and she 's been on the top ten or whatever . 
do you happen to be working for a large firm ? 
i guess that 's not large compared to some , 
but it 's big enough . 
and they do n't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything 
and i wish they did . 
but i put all the money into it . 
they do n't add anything . 
what about you ? 
i work for a fairly large company . 
it 's got eight thousand people . 
and we do have health insurance . 
but we do have retirement . 
they kind of match up to , you , 
if you put six percent , they match up to six percent , 
and then the rest is whatever you want to put in . if you put more than that or something like that . 
that 's a pretty good deal . 
it 's not bad . 
now , how long does it take for your contribution to vest ? 
i do n't know . 
it 's probably a long time . 
the place i work at 's , health insurance is kind of expensive . 
it 's hundred bucks a month or something for a family . 
otherwise guess you can hold money back and then either use or lose it or can just have that money put in your paycheck . 
we have one of those use it or lose it plans , too , where they 'll basically pay for child care type expenses . 
i can send in a request for payment 
and they 'll send me a check for the amount they withheld . 
that 's pretty good . 
it saves a third off on taxes or something . 
it depends on which company you work for . 
i know that the one plan that everyone seems to be in , in my place is plan d . 
deductibles are really high , 
but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because if you 're relatively , healthy , then it 's really unlikely that you 'd use that amount of money . 
so , someone did start a cost benefit analysis , 
and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and take a loss , whatever it happens to be , if you happen to be a healthy individual . 
i guess , 
on the other hand i had a similar health plan 
and one of my kids was in a car accident 
you mean , not even your car insurance ? 
it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance , 
no fault here , 
and i had a high deductible on the car insurance 
that 's too bad . 
i do n't know , 
i think other than health insurance an extra week of time off would be nice . 
i only get two weeks . 
my place you get two weeks when you start 
and then every year they give you an extra day until you 've got four weeks . 
that 's nice . 
we do n't get them till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week . 
that 's a long time . 
especially in the kind of engineering job i 'm in companies do n't stay afloat that long , 
with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used to be much more stable . 
it 's a lot less stable than it used to be . 
they used to have job security crap , 
but now they do n't . 
you work for bell or something like that ? 
i do n't know , 
a lifelong job security 
all that stuff . 
i do n't think so . 
they 're always laying people off , which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security . 
they must have pretty good severance , though ? 
i do n't know , 
we have n't been doing layoffs . 
we 've been doing down sizing with getting rid of extra layers of management . 
and i do n't know what they do for those people . 
mean the management they get rid of ? 
some of it , 
mark , our situation is that we do have a daughter that is in the situation of choosing college . 
she 's actually at bible college for this current year . 
and i guess first and foremost , really it 's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then which colleges or universities can best offer that program , 
and then it comes down to the dollar . 
it 's whether or not you 're a resident for that jurisdiction , 
it comes down to trying to come with a trade off of the costs . 
i agree pretty much with everything you 've said . 
the one thing that i 'd advise any parent or any person looking for a college is that i think , it 's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the actual students there 
the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs is n't always the whole story . 
the catalogs are sales material . 
it does n't matter whether they 're selling school . 
and , it really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school . 
they just live in the community . 
i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities , particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is right on campus as well 
and that changes the character of it quite a bit . 
it tends to be a very conservative school 
and there does n't seem to be the diversity of views that a lot of universities will have . 
i guess we 're here , 
this is the university that has , for years had the car , that will travel the farthest on a small quantity of gas , 
our engineering students . 
and that 's the kind of thing that also if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school . 
as sort of some development and some training 
it 's easy enough to crank out graduates , 
but to really challenge them 
do you have anyone that you 're seriously needing to feed information to ? 
i do n't really know of anyone that 's looking for colleges now with the exception of people 's younger brothers and sisters . 
but 
actually i 'm more interested in choosing the right job when you graduate type information . 
that 's really , a valid point that people need to consider as well . 
going to university is going to take four to eight years depending on the programs person 's involved in 
program . 
and after that , you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself 
and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market 
like a fine arts education , 
best training in the world is not going to put food on your table . 
the recycling program here is just terrible . 
it 's hard to find places to go . 
do they do newspapers ? 
i do n't know , 
i really do n't know what the details are . 
as a matter of fact , i 'm pretty sure there 's a place you can call and find out the closest thing to you , 
they pick up newspapers and milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans like soup comes in and stuff . 
they pick up everything . 
they all have shopping carts and stuff 
and they go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff , 
and so we used to just save them up 
and then they 'd come around 
and we 'd give them to them . 
during the winter time they move south or something 
so , i do n't do that anymore . 
i know it , 
i know it . 
they just overflow . 
it piles up . 
what 's a guy to do . i asked myself . 
i just do n't know . 
i just do n't know 
you ca n't really unload all your stuff . 
that 's true , 
had n't thought about that . 
that is very inconvenient . 
inconvenient , even . 
i know it , 
i know it . 
i 'm kind of bad about it . 
if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i 'll throw it in there , 
but i do n't ever take anything . 
you ought to , because the farmer 's market recycles absolutely everything . 
but wait 
i 've never seen you before . 
who are you ? 
my name 's bill . 
me , too . 
i just think that everybody ought to do it . 
do you know ? 
what about those grocery bags ? 
but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over . 
but , also most places big star does 
they 'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic . 
and they have little boxes that you can put your old bags in . 
can bring them in . 
those petroleum products are going to kill us . 
i know it , 
i know it . 
it really is a small , hostile planet . 
did you know that , 
really not . 
paper does n't seem threatening at all . 
it is , though . 
it comes from trees . 
how can it be bad ? 
they treat it with chemicals or something ? 
why ca n't trees break down ? 
i do n't get it . 
they do treat paper with chemicals 
you can bury a piece of yellow paper , 
it will still be there in a couple of weeks . 
it will be whole . 
you 'll be able to read off of it . 
i 'm glad you told me that , because i use those at work , where i work 
but i can just forget that from now on . 
i 'm going to switch to the white ones . 
white paper 's bad too . 
they treat it , too . 
i 'm sure that 's fine . 
i 'm sure . 
maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again . 
you think so ? 
maybe . 
tablets ? 
i think we should just abandon the written word altogether . 
you think ? 
i do n't know , 
what do you think ? 
everybody has a computer . 
kind of radical , i know 
we would no longer need paper at all . 
that 's true . 
i would love that . 
do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have ? 
actually 
because i 'm in school . i kind of miss out on most of the current events . 
i just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it . 
i do n't watch a lot of it , 
basically that 's my only major source of information . 
what about you ? 
i get a bunch of different things . 
i get a newspaper every day 
and i try to at least have a few minutes to look through that 
that satisfies most of the short term news i get . 
do n't have enough time 
and do n't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that , 
and that 's about all i ever hear of it . 
the news is n't immediate what you 'd generally think of as news , 
but it 's recent material . 
and it 's more in depth . 
it is more in depth , less broad . 
actually , it probably is n't less broad , 
but it 's just more in depth 
and it is more just significant information . 
it is the big events , not the little events . 
not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of broad and main . 
i know , 
where they 're just trying to fill in . 
or they 're making time because they . 
i know , 
i do , too . 
and , then there 's nothing that really is so exciting . 
you may find one little news item interesting 
so you have to wait twenty minutes to hear about it . 
that 's about what it ends up being . 
listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something . 
i do n't get to read it as much as i like , 
but i think that 's a good magazine . 
i think they 're about the same . 
they certainly have a very similar charter at least in my mind . 
and what kind of news normally interests you , 
what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring ? 
that 's going to affect our economy quite a bit . 
i think it will , 
they keep claiming it 's going to have a big influence , 
but we 've yet to see it 
it 's real short term yet , though , 
it 's only been , three months or something like that since that happened 
but they like to tell us that it 's going to be important . 
i think it is , too . 
i think that 's a possibility , 
we might also be helped , though , because it will be easier to do business over there , too . 
definitely . 
for the companies that already have a presence over there 
so they have a toe hold , 
good toe hold . 
because once you 're in there , then you can easily expand . 
and they 've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet . 
i 'm sure within those people 's minds , it 's quite justified . 
i can understand their viewpoint , 
they 're starting off , 
their economy 's a little bit weak , 
before they open up their borders to everyone . 
do you watch anything with sports or anything like that ? 
actually i 'm not really into sports . 
my roommates are , 
so , unfortunately , i forced to watch quite a bit of sports . 
against your will . 
we have to , fight over the remote control . 
at least you guys have a remote control . 
it 's sometimes better to not have one of those . 
i do n't think anybody pays too little . 
i would tend to agree very highly . 
i think that we 're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it . 
do you get hit up for local taxes there ? 
we sure do . 
we pay five percent sales tax , 
you name it , they tax it . 
that 's right 
tax free or die . 
which is probably pretty nice , 
but i 'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high . 
there 's no sales tax either ? 
what there is , is very high property taxes because that 's how they fund schools and everything . 
so they hit me up for the five percent there . 
it 's only a state tax here , no local . 
we 've got a five percent sales tax . 
but the problem is that i 'm paying state tax even if i do n't live here . 
but , at least on things like stock options and things like that , they do n't tax me . 
so that 's not too bad . 
i worked in a factory last summer 
and , on the average , i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes 
and i do n't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that . 
i do n't utilize any government welfare services . 
of course , i drive on the roads 
and i went to the schools and stuff , 
but i really feel that i 'm just getting overtaxed . 
that 's not any fun . 
most people forget about them , because you ca n't always get your f i c a back at the end of the year . 
and then , a five percent surtax , 
which is just outrageous 
and if you look at the way the government is run these days , it just seems like a lot of it 's going to waste . 
i think there , certainly are some things where you need infrastructure 
there are things government does better , 
i think government does a better space program than you 're going to get out of private individuals , 
that 's right , 
got to keep those farmers happy . 
they are a fat . 
i think the military is really fat . 
there is just way too much bureaucracy 
and then you look at how well they 're managed , 
i do n't think we 're getting our money 's worth out of there . 
i think it 's all going into bureaucrats . 
and a lot of it 's feeding that . 
and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens 
and then they go and say , i 'm not , 
congress , they 're the fault for it . 
but the other thing is , it 's tricky , though , 
so it 's very tricky to balance that stuff off , because then you hurt , 
if people lose their jobs , then they become a load 
and they 're not contributing taxes . 
that 's right . 
so it 's very hard to say this is what we should cut . 
that 's going to lower our national expenditures , 
but then you 're going to have people on welfare 
and they 're not putting taxes in . 
who are n't contributing . 
i 'm glad i 'm not the one who has to come up with these policies . 
but , what 's very funny is in our town meeting they were , 
they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this . 
course , the only problem with that is then nobody . 
that 's right . 
you have any pets ? 
do i have pets ? 
i have a cat 
and i have two dogs . 
two dogs , 
what kind ? 
it 's a miniature . 
. i 'm going into all this because i just got done working at a pet shop . 
and i 'm taking care of his dog 
and he says , my dog does n't like cats , 
they just are fascinated . 
so she does n't know that this is a cat yet . 
that 's good . 
and they get along real good . 
so that was interesting . 
did n't expect that would happen . 
that 's cool , 
that 's nice . 
let 's see , 
what was the other dog you had ? 
she 's real sweet little dog . 
she 's got a very nice temperament . 
everybody seems to be really happy with them . 
they 're good temperament . 
they 're a good temperament 
they put up with a lot . 
i think they have a good head on their shoulders . 
i think they have a higher level of intelligence than other dogs that i have encountered . 
there are some smart ones out there , 
but there 's also some , not so smart ones . 
it seems the smaller the are , the worse off they are . 
they 're bred down so much . 
they are n't the best pets . 
i really do n't know what the best pet is . 
i guess it 's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal . 
and bull dogs . 
but i do n't know about these pit bulls that are so vicious . 
pit bull . 
they 're actually very friendly dogs . 
are they really ? 
i do n't think i 've ever seen one . 
they 're really nice . 
i 've dealt with quite a few of them . 
customers that bring them into the shop and ask me they fit collars and stuff on them 
and they are just really nice , really friendly kind of medium intelligence . , 
how did they get their reputation , then ? 
they train them to be that way , then . 
you really ca n't get a pit bull from birth that 's that way . 
it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond . 
so the poor animal is doing it in self protection . 
and so once you get them going , it 's not good , to deal with , 
but , i really like them . 
i was impressed by them . 
and they are n't that big . 
and just really friendly . 
that 's unusual . 
i was overwhelmed . 
i suppose you were surprised . 
right now , 
they picked up a lot of bad press lately . 
they 're banned in some areas i understand . 
but , any pet can be bad if you train it to be that way . 
these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret . 
the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild 
and they should expect something like that to happen . 
did it attack the child , then ? 
it bit him . 
and that was not a good thing , 
but i think it was probably an individual ferret thing , because it was a fairly wild ferret . 
the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that . 
they really should have expected it . and taken the precautions . 
they did n't . 
it 's too bad it happened , though . 
because then the animal 's in trouble , and not the person . 
go ahead . 
the subject is child care and how to determine child care , 
and that 's an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children , 
but i did run a child care facility for a while . 
you should have some opinions on that , then . 
i do have some thoughts on that , 
it 's an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent or parent for a lot of people there , 
and it 's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities . 
i guess if i were going to choose my first consideration would be safety . 
my second consideration would be health . 
and i guess my third consideration would be warm personal environment . 
so you meet the standards , 
but then after that there 's a lot more . 
absolutely . 
as a matter of fact , i believe that the safety and health issues depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children . 
and that was the most difficult thing of all , to find the right people , the qualified people . 
and that includes an atmosphere in which the child is safe and he 's watched and his physical needs are cared for , 
when a couple has a child , then they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting . 
that would be lovely . 
get rid of all these child care centers , at least for young kids below the age of six . 
and then , of course , to make up for that the parents would have to work in their later years longer , 
in other words , they probably may end up not working at all in the twenties . 
that would be okay . 
the world is changing from industrial , base to information base 
and so what that means is you do n't have to be physically powerful to work . 
that 's exactly right . 
all you have to do is have a sharp mind , 
what kind of music you into ? 
i have a pretty wide taste in music , ranging from progressive rock to jazz to lot of different forms of music . 
in fact , it 's easier for me to say the types of music that i do n't like are opera and screaming heavy metal . 
the opera it 's right on track . 
i like classical , 
but i ca n't deal with opera at all . 
i 'm into some industrial music that 's , a bit even harder than that . 
it 's got to have a point to it . 
i do n't mind music that 's difficult to listen to , 
what kind of progressive stuff ? 
i 'm thirty , 
and it 's not really that they 've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed . 
it 's , a lot of people saying that bands in that position sold out . 
i think that 's pretty much bull . 
it 's interesting . 
they 're producing similar music 
and it 's good music 
but people have picked up on it . 
that 's good . 
i think it is . 
i 'm impressed . 
for a while there , popular music seemed to have , not a lot of point to it . 
and i could go down to a bar that 's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money . 
but he picked the right songs 
and , that 's about all he had going for him . or still has , for that matter . 
i guess . 
i 'm sure that sold a lot for him . 
that 's all you really need for a lot of pop . 
i 've kind of developed a short hatred for pop . 
it just seems like there 's no real point . 
it 's interesting because you were saying that you liked classical music 
and i like a lot of classical music , 
but i also dislike some classical music , 
i can believe that . 
what kind of things do you like in classical ? 
what 's the standard ? 
stuff that i like , 
he can make a lot of noise when he 's so inclined . 
and that 's interesting music , 
that 's right , 
we 'll do the ninth 
and everyone will know it and hum it 
it 's safe . 
and it just is n't chance taking enough for me . 
we used to , when i was younger 
we 'd go every weekend . 
but we have n't done whole lot of it lately . 
i 'm kind of into it . 
so 
i was kind of into it for a while there . 
for the most part . 
we do n't get to do a whole lot of that up here . 
whereabouts is that ? 
is that right ? 
that 's pretty wild . 
so you got some lakes around you can do that on . 
you do skiing and stuff 
little bit . 
just got through snow skiing . 
that sounds good . 
the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now . 
it was heavy when we were there though . 
i did n't see any boats there , though . 
not too many , 
but 
i just got back from a weekend . 
we went and had a , kind of a picnic in the woods type thing . 
it was pretty nice , 
but i had a boat last summer that i took out , a catamaran that i did a lot of sailing on and stuff . 
that 's a lot of fun , 
but my parents are pretty big sailors , too , 
they 're kind of into it . 
all we have up here mostly bass boats . 
i guess fishing 's a pretty big thing , 
lot of fishing going on up here . 
what major city is nearby ? 
and that 's south or north of there or something ? 
let me see , 
that sounds pretty good . 
does that stay pretty constant there 
it gets cold at night , and then warm in the afternoons . 
that 's not too bad . 
but 
have you done any other boating then 
i had n't done any lately , 
but that 's all , 
and when i was in high school , we used to go boating every day just about . 
that 's great . 
and we had a different boat every day . 
that 's fantastic . 
i 'd go to work , 
i 'd like to do some sailing . 
it 's a lot of fun . 
especially if you get a pretty fast boat 
if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that 
my family 's pretty into it 
and i took sailing lessons when i was about six 
is it pretty easy ? 
it 's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and the physics behind it . 
so it 's not too bad , 
it 's pretty easy to get the hang of , i think 
and generally , everybody i 've known has kind of gotten into it , 
that 's about all we have . 
lot of people do n't see the excitement in sailing , 
but , then , again , they may never have tried anything like catamaran 
and that 's when you really start getting into speed , 
they get so fast . 
i did n't know that . 
they get pretty quick , 
that would be something . 
i have n't personally done that , 
what lake do you all use ? 
so he usually goes on one of the great lakes and does his sailing . 
and there 's a lot of places there you can go . 
so that 's a good thing . 
but 
so , what do you do for a job ? 
are they primarily electronic , then ? 
it 's real nice . 
been here all my life . 
no doubt . 
or do you think there 's too much crime now ? 
i guess , any crime is too much 
but , it 's out of control . 
out of control , i do n't know . 
i guess it could be worse . 
we 've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood . 
there 's a lot of problems . 
you know . 
it 's got problems . 
i wonder what really is the answer . 
i think most people regard it as a warehouse . where you put away the people that are so bad that you do n't want them out in circulation . 
but the problem is that we only have but so much room 
and we try to put aside in the warehouse , 
and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes 
that 's what i hear . 
do n't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea ? 
i get the feeling that a lot of people have . 
i 'm not convinced that i have . 
and she was dealing mostly with people that were in on drug crimes 
you mean she taught in a prison ? 
i see . 
and , the problem she had was not with the inmates at all . 
the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison . 
the bureaucracy . 
obviously i did n't see the classroom and , hopefully never will , 
but , they put her at the end of a hallway , 
there were no other classes going on at the time 
i do n't know exactly what that is , 
so she did n't feel safe . 
she did n't . 
she did n't , 
she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates , 
and then later on the administration kept getting worse , 
and she got a couple of inmates that she did n't feel quite as comfortable around . 
she did n't feel that public schools were safe , 
so next thing you know she 's teaching in a maximum security prison . 
at least it 's maximum security . 
you said that perhaps people have given up the thought that rehabilitation 's possible 
and i 'm thinking that it 's even to the point that the people that run the system have given up on it . 
i think the people that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical . 
i talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff 
you can get pretty hardened , i 'm sure . 
i always have problems because i can never decide whether or not i 'm supposed to be a conservative or a liberal 
but i keep thinking that there 's got to be some way , that a lot of this is circumstances . 
those are funny labels . 
i ca n't help but wonder if i grew up without a father , on the streets , and with little or no money , would n't i be in prison at this point ? 
i think you can blame it on social problems . 
i do n't know . 
there 's not enough beds and treatment programs , rising drug abuse , 
and 
it 's a mess . 
what he wants to do is take all the money that he gets for drug enforcement and use it for drug education . 
and basically , just attack the problem at the demand side . 
stop trying to attack supply which to some extent makes sense and to some extent does n't . 
and they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park 
let 's see , 
i guess i can start . 
we 're actually trying to find one now because our family 's growing . 
are you really ? 
so i 'm looking at something larger than what we have . 
so , i 'm looking for something bigger , 
which are both kind of small . 
and we 're looking at some just four door , five passenger sedans as well . 
or , you open to buying foreign cars ? 
i do n't really have a preference either way , 
but i have n't had any real substantial problems with the ones i 've had . 
and i really like it a lot . 
but when i bought the car that i bought now , i did that also 
there 's a door seal that does n't quite seal 
and you have to take it back every once in a while . 
it 's clearly just a design problem there . 
it is . 
right now , 
the next car i buy is going to be sort of a sports car . 
i would really like to have a sports car . 
i do n't have a family , 
but i do n't like it enough to buy it . 
but something along that lines . 
interesting . 
because i have an economy car right now , which is okay , 
but i think i 'd like to move on to something a little better . 
that 's interesting . 
i guess probably the factors we 'd use to compare are a little different because i look for size and safety , and then mileage . 
probably , 
when i bought the car that i bought , i was looking for mileage , 
but it depends on what you pay initially . 
that 's right . 
actually it was my wife 's car that she brought into the marriage 
we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles , 
and they were okay . 
and i never had a problem with it , 
but my mother had a dodge at one point 
and i had driven it a few times 
i guess you 'd have to say , if i was looking , i would definitely be looking for a foreign car . 
that 's interesting . 
which is a good deal . 
so all the depreciation has been taken off 
and , the dealer comes out okay , 
i do n't know what kind of hit they take on it , 
but sounds like everybody 's had their chance to make their money off it 
but , i do n't know , 
i 'm sure they did . 
but that 's a little bit more than we want to spend right now . 
but it 's interesting , 
but i do n't know , 
what are your benefits like at your job , 
and how do you feel about them ? 
pretty good , actually . 
and they have a pretty good benefits package . 
in fact , they 're kind of known for having good benefits . 
the pay is n't fabulous , 
although i saw a survey recently 
and i 'm making actually over the average for my career , my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me . 
that 's good . 
what kind of a degree have you got ? 
and i 'm not a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff . 
anyway , our benefits are pretty good . 
that 's pretty generous , although you have to hold the stock for two years before you get the company contribution which is , kind of a pain , 
how long have you been with them ? 
i 've been with them for seven years . 
that 's good . 
and , the best thing is four years or five years you 're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything , 
but there 's several medical plans to choose from that cover pretty much everything . 
i do n't get sick that often , 
so i do n't pay much of it , 
and i pay five dollars every time i visit the hospital . 
they do n't cover eyes though , 
and i have contact lenses , 
so that 's kind of a pain . 
but i can live , 
but , for all practical purpose , you are almost a hundred percent covered . 
that sounds like you must feel really good about it . 
and the dental plan is fabulous . 
but that 's not the case , 
so , i guess nothing . 
it 's fabulous . 
what about you ? 
i also have a part time job at a law firm 
and i get no benefits from them , at the part time work although , they pay better per hour than my sort of , quote , real job does . 
they 're not the greatest . 
i 'm a computer scientist 
and at that time , i was in gravy city . 
and benefits were just amazing 
and we had everything paid for , 
and with the government , it 's not quite that nice a deal . 
but it 's okay . 
what we have to do is , we have to pay about twenty percent of our costs 
and the plans that are available to us range from kind of mediocre to really sweet 
so i think i 'm actually involved in a relatively good plan at this point . 
but it could be better , 
that 's for sure , 
but , there are other things that you get when you work for the government in terms of more relaxed atmosphere . 
it 's really nice for me , anyway , to be able to work in a research atmosphere where i do n't have to worry about academics or anything like that , 
and , so i 'm really kind of happy about that end of things . 
one of the things with my company is that they 've got a reputation for a lot of job security 
i , myself have moved around quite a bit within the company 
and i have n't had to move my residence to do that . 
that 's fabulous . 
that 's interesting , 
and i 've been over to see his complex over there 
and it 's amazing . 
it 's all ecologically designed 
and , he seems really , really happy with the set up . 
and he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position . 
kind of interesting . 
how serious is the , subject of crime in your area ? 
d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital . 
it 's really bad here . 
and they 're starting to get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school , of all things . 
it seems to be that gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions . 
that 's how they bind themselves together in groups , i guess 
interestingly enough , i do n't think we have here , a lot of gangs , not a whole large group of them , but just a few . most of them centered around drug territory . 
and so they 're protecting their economic interests , i guess . 
and nowadays the latest thing i 've read about in the paper here that they 're doing as far as crimes involving stealing cars is that , instead of stealing cars at night , breaking into them or whatever , they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up , and then as you get out of the car , they just step up and take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house . 
that 's efficient . 
that 's the latest thing . 
that way there 's no damage to the car or anything . 
they just wait for you to show up after they 've picked out which one they want . 
just wait for you to drive to your house , 
you get out 
and they get in , 
off they go with your car . 
i think they call it car jacking around here . 
i 'd heard that phrase . 
that 's kind of the latest thing , 
but , every year in the d c area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides , 
so it 's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we 're not from around here , 
and we 've just come from twenty years in the military which is an entirely different environment , 
so this is a whole new thing , for us to have to put up with 
and it 's really scary sometimes . 
there are n't that many , places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays . 
and it 's pretty bad when they 're using metal detectors in school 
what do you do to reduce crime in a major city like d c where it 's a way of life for everybody . 
i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem . 
i do n't know what the solution is . 
there 's no way they can stop the drugs , 
and that 's what 's causing all the killing . 
there 's a couple of things that i 've heard , 
most of them are fairly radical in terms of what you 'd have to do . 
course the reason that these kids tend to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems to be just the end results of poverty and parents that are n't doing any parenting and everything else 
because the parents are n't making a living at anything . 
they grow up with that as their way of life 
and i think to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised . 
it 's illegal , 
but it 's not wrong because all their friends do it . 
so maybe it 's the law that in their eyes 
and they say , it 's the law that 's got to be changed instead of their way of life , 
so , i do n't know , 
i 'm glad it 's not the kind of problem i have to come up with an answer to because it 's not easy . 
i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of an actual solution to the problem . 
the other social problems would n't go away . 
they 've always been with us . 
and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus , 
but then , the more i thought about it , the more sense it made . 
have you ever served on a jury ? 
i 've not . 
i 've been called , 
and you ? 
i was called 
and then i was not chosen . 
i was , originally chosen primarily because i was a young fellow 
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict . 
i do n't know why . 
something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago . 
and they kind of liked me . 
i do n't know what they saw in me , 
but they saw it . 
but back to the issue , 
i do n't know , 
but , there , too , there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly in civil cases . 
but in civil cases , i think a majority rule by jury would be sufficient . 
could you give me an example of a case where you think that ? 
in a criminal case one in which there is assault or some such . i think there ought to be a unanimous vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . 
a majority rule would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases . 
i do n't know if i 'm making any sense or not . 
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more tangible 
often there 's more incriminating evidence . 
do you think that in a civil case , if there was majority rule , that it would be easy for someone to be set up ? 
i really ca n't say for certain , truth be known . 
as it stands , there 's many ways and means by which a person can be set up , both in a civil and criminal case . 
the documentary , the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that . 
i do n't know if you 're familiar with that or not . 
i 'm not . 
a fellow when he was much younger was tried and convicted and sentenced to death . 
the case was reopened 
and he was exonerated . 
i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served . 
many laws , but little justice . 
and i also think , just like you were talking about before , why you were chosen to be on a jury that just , the process of picking jurors is not always objective . 
certainly not , 
certainly not . 
and they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this , 
because you get up 
and they ask you a few questions , 
both sides do , 
each attorney can use that as much as they like 
or , i think it 's a limit now , 
they probably have a limit now , 
but , they pretty much go through that , 
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you ca n't serve . 
for me , it was financial hardship , 
but , onto the thing 
i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing . 
it was always my impression that the justice himself , or herself , had the final say . 
what kind of experience do you have , then with child care ? 
i wonder if that worked . 
does it say something ? 
i think it usually does . 
i do n't know , 
hold it down a little longer , 
i do n't remember . 
it seemed like it did , 
but it might not . 
i guess we can start . 
i do n't have any kids . 
she just had a baby , 
he 's about five months old 
do you have kids ? 
i have three . 
i do . 
i do n't work , though , 
but i used to work when i had two children . 
but i do n't envy anybody who 's in that situation to find day care . 
but , does your sister live in a big community ? 
it 's a fairly large community . 
she got real lucky , though . 
he had a boss who moved into a larger office 
and she 's able to take her baby to work with her . 
and it 's a small office that she works in 
and it 's a legal office , 
and it 's just one lawyer 
and so she 's the only one really that takes care of the office . 
there 's no one else that works there . 
and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby , 
so it works out pretty good for her . 
how lucky . 
i know a lot of people around here sometimes have mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids 
but , the community i 'm in is not a real large one , 
so it 's fairly safe . 
to get references and that , 
worried that they 're not going to get enough attention ? 
and they 're expensive 
and , course , there 's a lot of different types of day care available , too where they teach them academic things . 
or they just watch them and let them play and things like that , 
take a long time to find the right place 
and you do n't always even know if it 's going to be the right place or not . 
anything could happen . 
i guess after he gets to a certain age she 's going to have to take him to a day care . 
when she ca n't keep control of him 
and he starts crawling 
it would be hard , 
i think it would be kind of stressful . 
it would be nice to have him around 
or the phone rang at the wrong time . 
i think she has problems with that , too . 
when you have kids , will you work ? 
do you work now ? 
i do n't know 
that 's something i 've considered . 
i always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time . 
is that what you do ? 
i teach my kids at home , 
so i 'm here all the time . 
so they do n't go to school . 
what 's that called , 
it 's correspondence school , 
they do it at home . 
that 's interesting . 
do you have to have any special training ? 
it depends on the state you live actually . 
some laws absolutely prohibit it . 
some states say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that . 
our state does n't yet , say that 
and i 'm not a certified teacher . 
i went to college , 
but my kids are only elementary levels right now 
so they have n't been to public schools at all . 
one of them was for a couple of years 
and so my oldest , he was , 
and then my youngest two have never been . 
what they do is they have three judges , basically . 
and you get up there 
and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence 
and your defense attorney presents their evidence 
and those three guys take the evidence , go off , figure it out and then come back and say whether you 're guilty or not . 
our judicial system is in such total chaos . 
i think what they need to do is , they need to somehow take the money out of it . 
we have a family called all day family . 
they were all murdered . 
all the people signed confessions , 
they went to a trial by jury . 
has nothing to do with justice whatsoever . 
it 's one of those things , 
i would have to look at it . 
because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures , 
they know what 's good and what is n't , 
they 'd be able to say , i 'm sorry , 
you ca n't use this as evidence because it was either illegally obtained or whatever 
and then the judge says , , 
disregard that . 
come on , 
any jury 's not going to disregard the evidence . 
that 's true . 
i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself . 
that may very well be . 
i hold it in the utmost contempt . 
my favorite is the police department , 
they 're not aimed at the criminal . 
the judicial system is aimed at the citizens 
because you and i , we have work schedules , 
we can be called at work , 
we have social security numbers , 
they can trace us down , 
we have telephones , 
then we have checkbooks . 
criminals have none of these things . 
they 're real difficult to catch , 
and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas we write a check . 
so where do you think they target their efforts ? 
that 's true . 
they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals . 
how would you go about changing it ? 
i 've nailed the problem down 
leave the details up to somebody else . 
yet , you go out on the streets 
and they 're giving speeding tickets . 
talking about the lawyers what might very well cause a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases . 
takes him two minutes , 
he still charges you that hundred dollars . 
so , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that whether it 's a murder case or somebody suing somebody else , you get x dollars for that case 
and that 's it . 
i firmly believe in that 
none of this , 
because when you get the most heinous of crimes , have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney ? 
and he 's got a attorney that you and i could never afford . 
that 's true . 
who 's paying for that ? 
you 're talking to part of them that 's paying for that . 
and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it 
that 's right . 
it 's amazing 
and when you stop and look at it the judges , they 're all former lawyers . 
that 's another problem . 
i think to really correct the judicial system , you have to get the lawyers out of it . 
they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever , 
i guess it starts recording now . 
i do n't really know that much about the recycling in this area that we 're in . 
fact as far as i know , the school does n't have any kind of programs or anything out here . or the grocery store or anything in this area , 
i guess the city has bought the big green trash cans 
and they have a recycling truck that comes around now 
and you separate your glass and paper and aluminum 
and you set it out 
and they pick it up 
and it works real neat . 
they seem to be having a real good response . 
that is pretty good . 
we 're originally from another state 
and i know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing . 
the city set separate trash cans 
and you separated your stuff 
and you put it in there 
and they took it . 
on bottles , did they give you so many cents back for cans 
i do n't really know . 
i do n't really know , 
they started after we moved down here 
and so i 'm not really familiar . 
but i do n't know if they get anything back on it 
or , do you get money for it ? 
i noticed it 
so you do n't see too many thrown out around the streets . or even bottles . 
all kinds of bottles they really charge people when you purchase them and then when you turn them back in . 
i remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel . 
so , maybe that 's one thing they can do . 
i think now they 're a lot more expensive than that . 
and i know they were at least ten cents apiece . 
i was how much were those bottles ? 
and , they come in eight and ten packs instead of six packs 
and it was two dollars and something for the bottles . 
that was my brother 's first job in a grocery store . 
he was in the bottle area . 
it 's pretty dangerous out there when they fall over , 
they say that there 's a big glut of the green glass , 
of green glass . 
it 's amazing . 
out in this area , they really do n't have anything . 
but i do know some of these places were doing that 
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them . 
i notice the plastic have sort of faded away , the milk jugs . 
there 's too much labor involved to separate the stuff . 
more than it 's worth . 
i do n't know , 
it 's not as easy , selecting clean junk as they say . 
who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away . 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
we all do it . 
it was nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
i have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything . 
i think two or three minutes is fine . 
is that it ? 
it was nice talking to you 
and i guess actually , i was going to do it for my son so that he could make some money . 
but then it has my name on it , 
so i 'm okay , 
i 'll sit down here and call it . 
we 're doing it for a church choir 
are you ? 
that 's interesting . 
that 's nice . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
does the company you work for test for drugs ? 
they just recently started a policy of testing drugs , which was kind of interesting , 
because when i went to work for them they did n't do that , 
but since then they 've started a drug testing policy , not because of their own convictions , but because the clients of our company requests that we do that . 
how about you ? 
we 're not being tested for drugs at all , 
it says , use of narcotics on company premises . 
so that 's pretty general , 
but i work for an environmental management firm 
and i 'm an engineer there , 
but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites , 
but i do n't operate any machinery . 
now , people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a medical monitoring program , 
because they 're at a higher risk of exposure 
and blood screening is part of that 
they do test for drugs in that capacity , 
it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for . 
but i think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field . 
what is the nature of your company 's business ? 
we do oil well services . 
so , a lot of our clients are oil companies , big oil companies , 
we have engineers who go out to the client 's oil well , and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff , 
but the thing that 's interesting is that i 'm an engineer a software engineer 
and i work in the software house , 
and everybody there are all software engineers . 
they never go out to the oil rigs or anything , 
a little different , actually , 
but we have to go through the same thing , 
it 's a little different , than a lot of drug policies . 
in our case , it 's like , when you hire on , they 'll test you , 
and then if you get injured on the job , if you trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away . 
other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that , 
but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first . 
particularly we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol , 
and they did n't find any problem with that , 
that 's been an issue in our company even though we do n't have the random or even regular drug screening . 
in fact , they 'll have these little parties , 
my brother lives where i work , 
and i have many a time called him to come get me . 
and i do n't know , 
i think it 's got some relevance , 
but i think its relevance is pretty limited . 
in your case , i do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing . 
i think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident . 
it 's really bizarre . 
particularly where we are . 
and she was a personnel secretary 
and she had to get tested 
and , i do n't know 
i 'm ambivalent about the whole thing . 
they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense 
but i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job where i had to do a drug test 
and it was kind of a long story , 
but it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through , 
and it amounted to going in before any of these interviews , 
i 'm not even working for this company , 
i 'm going in for interviews 
and , before i went into any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical . 
they said it was going to be a physical , 
and actually beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening , 
but i had forgotten about that , 
and when i got in there , i was n't , able to give a full sample , 
and the procedure is utterly humiliating . 
you go in there with the doctor , 
he makes you take off all your clothes 
and then he examines you . 
or what do you think ? 
that 's a really hard question . 
i do know that politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths . 
our friend , the president , right now , says no new taxes , 
we should be cutting taxes now because of the recession 
and at the same time , the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases , 
so i know the politicians are n't straightforward . 
it 's hard to call . 
it really is . 
i never really thought that the question really had to do . 
i always . 
that 's tax 
we 're paying money 
and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire , the money will be there for us . 
, 
when i see that money taken out of my paycheck or every other week , i really think that money 's history 
and as far as return investment , that 's nothing 
and we 're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back . 
i may be wrong , 
but supposedly once you have an office in d c , and staff it with people , it 's really tough to close it down 
and they just have n't yet . 
that might be the difference . 
i do n't know . 
for some reason , historical sites with the full federal money and everything seem to appear almost as political favors to very strong politicians . 
and the poor president has to either accept or reject the whole thing . 
it sounds like you think that we 'd be able to save some money by passing the line item veto . 
i think the line item veto is not necessarily a bad thing , assuming that the president uses it to get rid of this kind of waste . 
on the other hand it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president not to veto important things . and just to get rid of the unimportant things . 
and whenever there 's that kind of subjective judgment , there 's always going to be a dispute as to where the boundary between waste and necessity is . 
so i 'm not sure that that will help solve our problems , 
i forgot , 
there 's a political term for this stuff , pork barrel or something . 
pork barrel politics . 
pork barrel politics . 
there has to be some way to do it . 
at least at the end . 
i do n't know , 
they were very good at first , 
and that 's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well . 
and then , of course , the bottom fell out . 
it 's tough . 
there 's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations . 
and spare the economy . 
it 's a hard balance . 
it definitely is . 
even not for government , 
even just for a small business . 
i know what 's hot down here with me , 
i do n't ever listen to the radio 
and that 's usually what 's hot around here 
what kind of music do you like ? 
mostly folk music . 
folk music . 
we 're on totally different wavelengths . 
what about classic rock type stations . 
i do n't listen to the radio at all . 
we live in a fairly small town , 
the type of music , at least to me , only sounds good at a high volumes 
and i do n't like listening at high volumes . 
but some of their older stuff was quite enjoyable to me . 
that 's something does n't even sound good loud really . 
definitely . 
anything new you like coming out now , other than folk music , some i might know of . 
i do n't know any folk music at all . 
i 'm sure there 's a lot of that down there . 
plenty . 
way more than i can stand down here . 
but it 's getting pretty big everywhere , as i see it . 
i think some of them , the artists are even hitting the pop charts . 
it 's kind of strange that it 's getting as big as it is . 
concert tours for country and western sings it 's quite odd , 
but i do n't know , 
music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays , i think . 
it 's becoming not necessarily good music , just popular music . 
i think most artists are in to make a few bucks . 
that 's what you say , 
and then music is wrapped around now . 
now , it 's the other way around . 
at least to my mind , guns and roses does n't have too much to say . 
they do n't have anything really important you want to hear . 
but it 's kind of odd , 
it 's like , it does n't have to be good , 
it 's just who does it . 
and i think , if somebody else were to play that everybody would think , that 's lousy , 
but because she did it , it 's supposed to be good , 
it comes to the point where it 's your name , not what you do more than anything . 
so it 's really backwards how things are working now 
it 's the artist , not the merit . 
i do n't think that 's a good thing at all , 
but , that 's the , point we 've reached , 
i do n't know , 
i know for myself that for the most part , i do n't know which artist is which , 
so i listen to a song , 
i either like the song 
or i do n't like it 
and then if i really like the song , eventually i 'll figure out who it was . 
that 's about how i am on popular music . 
everything i listen to is what i buy , not whatever they play on the radio 
you have to figure out what to buy , 
or do you just buy along the same artist ? 
i just mostly buy along the same lines all the time . 
i do n't really switch around to new things very often . 
it 's way to hectic and too confusing . 
so you keep buying the same artists until you do n't like an album , 
then you stop ? 
generally , 
or , about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i have n't heard 
and i listen to it that way , 
i do n't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i 've heard it . 
that 's one thing i like about some of the folk music scenes , 
there 's a couple of nice small coffee houses up in new jersey . 
and , it 's very nice , 
you go into the coffee house 
and an artist is there 
and very often the artist will have an album 
and , so if you like the artist , you buy the album . 
so you definitely get to try before you buy . 
you do n't always quite get it right , 
it 's lower than it has been in the past . 
what kind of crime problem do you usually run into ? 
any specifics ? 
, from what 's on the news there are very few actual robberies reported of residences . 
what 's more likely to occur is knocking over a small store or a car theft things of that nature . 
very few assaults , 
but mostly petty things and , nothing really too big . 
i guess here we run into that sometime , 
there are some , but not very high . 
as far as tellers and things like that , it 's not extremely high either . 
there were one case where this one guy was taking women from the teller and , making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time , raping them all , 
so that 's kind of like a double assault there . 
a strange case that happened about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine . 
it was a free standing machine 
and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it . 
there 's a crime for you . 
there 's a crime . 
and it did surprise me , because they were doing drug arrests and things like that , 
but i do n't really think those things happen too often because , like i said , from what 's reported in the news , at least , it 's not all that common . 
i do n't know , 
and a lot of it is due to drugs . drug related in most cases , 
it 's not like it 's 
it is for drugs because you really ca n't on the street make any money off of it per se , 
so it 's not really lucrative to take chances like that even though it does exist . 
i live in an apartment . 
and the apartment would be very easy for just about anyone to break in . 
but , even so , it 's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to lock the doors when they go out and things like that . 
it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just sit out back , take a look at when people are here and when they 're not just come in , 
it could still happen then . 
that 's true , 
but you 'd be surprised also how , much people watch you that . 
i guess there was one case , 
i was surprised , 
so happened this person worked at the same place , 
and they work at the same place i did , 
but i did n't know that they had been watching me 
because i was getting ready to go in my car one morning 
and the first thing they said is you do n't have to be to work at eight , 
shock , 
buying a car is something you 're contemplating , i take it . 
ca n't do it right now . 
our situation is that we 're a two car family 
it 's got a five year loan , 
so that 's still got a couple years to run 
what kind of a car do you think you 'll buy next ? 
something . 
how about you ? 
so i think the four door is probably a major requirement 
and , other than that reasonable cost and safety and as much economy as you can get out of a car . 
i 'm not looking for one with a great big engine 
something that will carry it around careful is best way to describe it . 
and that seems to be just fine . 
and i think that 's probably a little over kill for this day and age . 
i like trucks because they 're spacious , 
and it 's handy to haul things . 
it 's not related to my business , 
i just really use it , basically , for transportation , 
but there 's so many occasions when i 've had to move some members of the family or do this or that , 
and it 's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one . 
not really , 
it 's a two wheel drive truck 
and i figure if it 's so bad that i need a four wheel drive , i probably ought to be home anyway . 
actually pretty good way of looking at it , 
and we were n't aware of it , and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car , 
and , this is a rear wheel drive model . 
so , we got some monster studded snow tires after that . 
have n't had any problems since . 
i see . 
but it 's real nice for carrying around our kids and others 
and it 's got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around 
so we 've been able to do some real creative load hauling when called upon . 
and they have a child that 's five years old 
and it 's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff , 
so , i know if we had kids still at home , we 'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value . 
probably till the kids are out of high school anyway . 
what about all wheel drive ? 
is that something that you 'd be interested in 
and even as light as that is with the small tires it 's done pretty well in winter , 
again , like you , if conditions are that bad , i probably do n't want to be driving anyway . 
so i know i 'd be happy with a reasonable four door . 
what kind of crime do you think is the most prevalent in our society ? 
probably robberies , people stealing from each other . 
is that what happens up there a lot ? 
that 's mostly what i hear , though , is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen . 
that 's the most prevalent crime . the ones that really add up after a while far as insurance money and stuff like that , insurance costs . 
everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually . 
i wonder if drug use is a more prevalent crime , though , because so many people use it , 
it is a crime , 
that is a crime . 
speeding is a crime . 
that 's true . 
i break that law every day . 
but i was staying in the realm of felonies versus misdemeanors and drug use , 
actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor , 
have you been the subject of such a crime , such as stealing , or anything ? 
so i guess that was a crime . 
i got a year 's probation for that , 
that 's not that much . 
it was n't that big a deal . 
when i think of crime , i think of stuff that affects other people like people getting killed or raped . 
i think rape is one of the worst crimes . 
i think it is . 
in some ways , it 's almost worse than murder . 
it 's very degrading 
and . 
it is a rather final solution , though . 
but the person that 's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life . 
what do you think is an appropriate punishment for things such as rape or , murder or something like that . 
it 's a pretty good thing . 
i agree with that . 
the electric chair 
do they ? 
i think that 's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy 
and , i guess usually they 're always sure they got the right guy , 
i think the appeal process takes too long . 
so do i . 
i think it from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year . 
if that . 
a year 's plenty of time for something to come out , i guess . 
then there 's been guys in jail for six years 
and the other guy admits that he did it 
the system is n't perfect , 
it 's run by a bunch of imperfect humans . 
you do the best you can to make it perfect , 
you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect . 
but , i think you have to accept some of the errors . 
i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment for murderers . 
i do n't know if it would or not though . 
i do n't think it 's so much of a deterrent as it is a good way for vengeance for the relatives and family members , 
you know what i mean ? 
and society probably , too . 
just general society to , 
it kind of gets it off their chest . 
it does 
i know that a , lot of murders that you hear about are people that know each other . 
and they 're the , kind of crimes of passion and stuff like that . 
i do n't think you 'll ever stop all that stuff dead , 
you might be able to stop people , 
they 're thinking about it , 
they know they 're going to get the chair if they get caught . 
they can be , 
but usually they are n't . 
they 're spur of the moment 
that 's right . 
they could probably do it again . 
they would have no problems doing it again . 
that 's right , 
they did n't have any time doing it the first time . 
looks like we 're ready to go . 
capital punishment 
the problem i have with capital punishment is that it 's supposed to be a deterrent to crime , 
but i do n't think that it really actually does that . 
i do n't think it deters anybody , because most of the time crimes are committed without any thought to the consequences 
and they do n't stop and think and say , maybe i should n't do this because i might get the gas chamber or something like that . 
they worry about it afterwards 
and then they try and get out of it . 
and how about you ? 
i do , too , 
i think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not . 
you still have to do it . 
i 'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer 
so you 're in favor of capital punishment , then . 
for some things . 
needs to be punished or eliminated from society . 
you ca n't guarantee that they would n't escape from prison and do it again . 
and then do it all over again . 
and i do n't think that rehabilitation is effective . 
have to agree with you , 
and i 'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also . 
i just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because you still see them committing the same crimes , 
but , i tend to agree with you that we should have it . 
i do n't know that it 's always effective , 
but i guess we 're kind of stuck with it . 
it 's a difficult problem to determine how you 're going to punish somebody for a particular crime , 
but , then i think that some murderers do n't really warrant capital punishment like , for example you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them 
and i do n't think , that would really warrant capital punishment . 
. do you think they should be punished at all , or go to prison , 
because they 're not really a danger to society . 
it was almost really self defense in a case like that . 
it is to a certain extent 
i know they put them in jail sometimes . 
and it , just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available . 
i wonder what you think about this 
and unfortunately , we do n't get to do it , 
but it used to be a long time ago if somebody did something , for example , to your family , then you had the right to administer the punishment . 
so if somebody killed somebody in your family , then if that person was caught and found guilty , you had the right to , execute that person . 
and i know that if somebody had done something to my family , i would feel that i had the right to get revenge on them 
but , i do n't think that 's done much anywhere . 
that 's kind of drastic punishment . 
i think that would be kind of drastic punishment . 
might make you feel better 
but , one thing , i think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated . 
but , like i said , if someone is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society . 
because they 're a danger to everybody else . 
that 's interesting . 
i have to agree with that . 
there 's a lot of folks , probably , that are in prison , that are n't really a danger to society , 
and a lot of people that are a danger to society that are n't in prison . 
probably more of them then the other way around . 
interesting . 
not sure 
i 'm not sure what kind of capital punishment we have here . 
it sounds like you 've got a television going on there , 
i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio . 
what station do you listen to ? 
it 's a local radio station . 
it 's called k l i f , cliff . 
cliff , 
i see , 
it 's not affiliated with anything , is it . 
it 's not a network station . 
because i listen to public radio a lot 
they 're getting a little feisty now . 
this station has a lot of just ongoing news 
i read it pretty much from cover to cover . 
how do you like it ? 
the times herald went out of business here 
that must be pretty bad . 
how did that happen , anyway ? 
financial trouble . 
not how , 
when did it happen ? 
i guess they closed down about three months ago . 
how do you keep up ? 
there 's , quite a task if you 've ever run into one . 
they 're very voluminous . 
they 're thick . 
if there 's something you want to know , it 's in the times and in detail . 
we used to have two papers here in town 
and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of just nobody was buying it really . 
so there really is only one major l a now ? 
pretty much . 
and they 're not bad as far as a local paper goes . 
it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff . 
and it 's a pretty good paper , 
but it 's not the times . 
and occasionally i pick up time magazine or something if they 've got an interesting lead story , 
i do n't have time . 
i used to read time magazine a lot , 
but i do n't read it much anymore . 
that 's kind of a problem for them . 
there 's a lot of people who fall into that , category . 
i see . 
the big dailies do n't like to step much out of their home turf , 
i have to admit , the times is kind of provincial , too . 
it 's basically anything that 's south of downtown , they do n't bother to cover . 
but it 's still not an awful lot of news . 
i know . 
it was a big discovery when the times found out there was a place called orange county . 
the way they 've been handling it before , they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the l a county border . 
and , of course , they tend to cover the county , 
so they tend to ignore places outside of the county . 
i find that attitude kind of arrogant , though . 
it 's you 're taking our money , but you 're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us . 
i get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to all things considered on national public radio . 
that is one of my big sources for current events information . 
i really like that coverage . 
my wife on the other hand is home most of the day 
and she watches a lot of the cable news network . 
have you ever heard of all things considered ? 
we do n't have the national public radio in my area . 
how do you think that the viewpoints differ ? 
or it 's not happening in your backyard 
so it 's not as personal , , 
they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it 
they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions . 
very much so , 
very much so , 
i think it 's important to interpret it , 
but a lot of times the person does n't have the experience to do the interpreting . 
which approach do you find to be more useful , 
i like the straight reporting . 
and then i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it . 
it 's nice to hear someone 's interpretation of it 
and a lot of time i do n't hear exactly what they write into it . 
so overall , i think i would rather hear just straight reporting . 
there was a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory , 
and while he was being severely censored and could not make any judgment call on this , it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda , 
but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that , this is n't a baby milk factory , 
how could he say it was , 
i think people have that opinion . 
you go first . 
i have two kids , 
i have one seven and one five 
and i 'm happy with it . 
i 'm happy with the school , 
it 's great , 
good teachers 
good curriculum 
they learn a lot , 
they have no problems , 
but i do live in the best part of the city , though , 
i 'm not , 
but , everybody around me is 
i have friends that live in the other , the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town 
and their schools are kind of rundown and older 
and they do n't really offer as much as the school that my girls are in . 
i do n't really think that 's fair . 
but i 'm happy with what they 're in , 
go ahead . 
it 's pretty much what i was going to say is there 's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in . 
and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs 
but the difference in schools was pretty substantial 
and one of the things that probably would have been better is if the entire county had just one school system . 
and that could result in more equitable distribution of money 
because what was happening was all the very rich people move out to the suburbs 
and the city had a very low tax base 
so they did n't have a lot of money to work with . 
as a result , the schools were rundown , 
there was n't as many of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked . 
there was n't as many advanced placement courses when i was a senior that some other schools had . 
so i think that one of the ways to help schools in general and get them all to a minimum level of competency almost , would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people , 
and the problem with that is then the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they 'll move farther away to get better schools . 
it 's kind of , you end up , like a dog chasing its own tail sort of . 
and you have got room mothers in every room , 
you 've got art mothers , 
you 've got every holiday , 
there 's parties . 
all these kids have these really supportive parents , always up there for something . 
and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid 's teacher 's name is , 
that has a whole lot to do with it , 
as far as their learning if the parents are n't willing to go with the kids and find out what they 're learning and if they 're learning they really do n't have much of a chance at all . 
why is that ? 
why is that ? 
why you asking , 
they just do n't , 
i 'm up there at my kids ' school , 
i know what they 're learning 
and if they 're up , i call and find out , 
is she having problems , 
does she need help with anything , 
she 's doing fine , 
and the kids are not motivated . 
they have no motivation from home , 
so they just go to school 
and i 'll get through the day , and bring homework home 
and , there 's nobody to sit them down and say , you 're going to do this . 
just they take a notion to do it , 
they do , 
and that does n't work either , 
they have to have guidance 
and they ca n't just have it at school and then come home 
and there 's nothing . 
i know that that was a big factor for me . 
i ended up coming out of the public school system very well 
and was very good education , 
and i think the difference for me was that they were always there , 
of course you 're going to study and do well 
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products ? 
not too bad really . 
but i got it anyway 
and they were real good about taking it back . 
it was n't a problem at all , 
so i was able to get that back pretty easily . 
but i do n't know , 
i really have n't returned a whole lot lately . 
have you ? 
i have n't had to . 
every so often i 'm almost pushing it myself . 
and say , i should have known better , 
i get pretty good stuff . 
i was reading something in consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact . 
so it 's what are you going to do ? 
but that 's the way it is . 
i do n't know , 
and manufacturers should get a clue 
and they should start making quality products . 
that 's what i thought , too , until i saw the consumer reports issue . 
they 've got all the cars rated , 
and essentially , i do n't see much of a trend . 
there 's nothing wrong with them . 
and they 're pieces of junk . 
i know . 
still at it , 
but i do n't know , 
maybe they 're getting better , 
maybe they 're starting to get a clue . 
they got a three year lead time . 
that 's just it . 
technology that comes in right now is probably not going to be implemented until quite a few years down the road . 
the computer industry 's where it 's really dynamic especially for the consumer . 
because technology is so volatile and changing all the time . 
or maybe i say , you paid five hundred bucks for this program , 
so send us twenty 
and we 'll give you a really great upgrade . 
they keep up with it pretty quickly 
and that 's a real good thing , i guess . 
i do n't know . 
and the hardware all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity 
they 're kind of the leaders right now . 
i used to see all those commercials for windows , 
. 
they 'd sell more if they were honest . 
almost is the key word , there , too because i 've used both 
and i really do n't see an advantage of windows at all . 
that 's true , too . 
but i do n't know , 
i 've gotten a little bit out of the personal computer business just because i do n't have one at home . 
but i really do n't do much with it at home 
if you bought a power book straight off , a lot of them had to go back . 
they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive . 
you sound like you must work in the computer business . 
i have one , 
i do desktop publishing at work 
and i have a machine at home 
and i belong to the user 's group 
but technically , i 'm not actually in the industry . 
i do n't work . 
that 's all right . 
that 's true . 
something that i find uncomfortable is you want to buy something , 
say you want to buy a personal computer 
and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for , 
i had a tune up done 
and i had the brakes done on it 
and then , the reason i did that was because i do n't have a scope 
and it 's hard to get at them 
and plus the time on them . 
i just do n't have time any more . 
and i had an occasion to have to change the battery once , 
i do have the background . 
i know what needs to be done 
and i know that the oil should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings 
and so i stay on top of that 
i wanted the bearings packed 
or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it 
just to pack the bearings ? 
just to pack the bearings , 
the other thing i let them do some times is that i let them go through and let them do the diagnostics . 
that 's free , 
and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it . 
but still it was cheaper in the long run 
so i just got the brakes done 
and i thought that was a good deal . 
but i 've had considerable experience . 
and i took auto shop in high school , 
it 's been a while back , 
but i still have a pretty good feel for it , 
i had bigger cars 
and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those 
i have almost one hundred and ten , 
and there was hardly any wear to them . 
they 've gotten to the point where they do n't weigh very much 
so i just did it anyway . 
i like to stay up on it . 
i just kind of stay up on it 
and then if you go and just about any point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil , the oil is a white golden brown . 
it 's not dirty . 
it sounds like you 've had some good experiences with that 
and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that . 
i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car 
they were just pressed aluminum . 
when i changed those over , i put on these pressed aluminum things 
and probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out . 
i was on my way to work one day 
and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank 
do you all have a budget ? 
we do . 
and we have three teenage daughters 
and they 're very expensive . 
so we have somewhat of a system . 
it 's kind of hard to explain . 
we 've actually gone just recently , to having two checking accounts . 
we always had just one . 
and now we are having two . 
it 's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it 's very personal . 
that 's kind of the way i feel about it . 
my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances 
and of course , we 're like a lot of people . 
we just scramble through month to month . 
do you have a two income family or one income ? 
we have a two income family . 
she also works 
but she enjoys it 
and she 's good at it . 
and one of these days i am going to do something about that i believe . 
you know how that goes , 
she handles it pretty well . 
she writes all the checks once a month . 
is her career related to finance or accounting ? 
she 's an annuity administrator 
and so she works for an insurance company . 
but she enjoys it . 
she likes keeping track of all that stuff 
so that 's sort of related to her field a little bit . 
sort of . 
and we 've experimented with , budgets from time to time , 
you have to keep up with them . 
so a lot of times , we just kind of play it by ear . 
we try to keep our retirement and our savings kind of automated 
so we never see that money . 
just taken directly . 
it 's just taking it out . 
we do the same thing . 
and that 's kind of handy . 
because if you do n't see it , you do n't miss it . 
you do n't spend it . 
you have something to take it out . 
that 's exactly what we 've always done 
they 've always had , where they match your funds , 
sometimes if you save so much , then they will match it . 
we 've done that too . 
but , my husband works for an insurance company 
and he has now for about ten years . 
but he was with another company before that , 
i work also , 
but i only have a part time job 
and i get paid very little 
we just transfer it into my account 
and then i use that for food , household expenses , 
and then i add my own check to that 
and then with that i try and handle some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that , 
it sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do . 
just kind of play it by ear , but keep the deductions . 
i mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down . 
i am given so much money a month , 
so i am suppose to kind of get the food out of that . 
i do n't ask for more . 
i just try and make it on that . 
because i think when you go to the grocery store , you can go crazy with all the choices that you have 
and you can really waste a lot of money that way . 
how long have you been married ? 
about five years . 
so you 're just really getting started . 
so do you have a family too ? 
i 've got one little girl . 
not really . 
not too bad . . 
not like she will later on . 
you will see that all of a sudden you 're trying to decide whether you are going to do soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do 
and then you really have to start saying now what can we afford , 
what can we do here 
and then you have to really sit down and plan some more 
but i think when we were back at your age , we did n't have much of a budget 
and then as the girls got older , i think we did more and more of that . 
more budgeting as they got older . 
but what do you do ? 
i 'm an electronic technician . 
i guess we 're not suppose to talk about those things . 
i 'd better get back to the subject . 
but budgeting . 
i found i feel a lot better . 
we use to work out of one check book 
and it would be very hard for me because i would n't have any idea how much money i was spending in one month . 
now , i know exactly what i 'm spending 
and it 's so much easier , 
i do n't know a lot about them . 
that 's great . 
actually that 's kind of the type of car that i 'm thinking about we might get . 
and supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things i 've heard . 
i 've heard a lot of people like them . 
like what ? 
let 's see . 
i like cars that are designed with human beings in mind , 
and that 's not just the driver and the passenger 
but that 's the person who 's working on it , 
cause i do almost all my own maintenance and those types of things . 
almost unlikely at this point . 
and i do most of the work on that myself . 
and when i look at modern cars and stuff like that , i just say i will never do that with the modern cars . 
it 's not worth my time . 
you ca n't get in there . 
you ca n't do anything . 
and it 's so complicated too . 
i look at it 
and i say , boy , 
i 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that . 
and i find that for everyday things . it 's really very easy to work on 
and i 'm kind of spoiled . 
and i really liked working on it . cause it was pretty easy too . 
so i 'm kind of biased in that 
and i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore . 
and that 's probably one thing i 'd look at . 
i think another thing i 'd look at is safety . 
that 's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about . 
that 's a real nice car , i think . 
it 's a really nice car . 
i think , it 's a stylish car both inside and out . 
it 's comfortable to drive . 
reasonable performance , 
i 've been real impressed with that . 
and i did n't realize that they were putting dual air bags in that car now . 
i think that , that 's excellent . 
but the thing is that it 's twenty thousand dollars . 
actually , my wife and i are actually contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so . 
so we 're actually been looking around and thinking about things . 
i do n't know . 
what do you call it ? 
that would be a good deal to go with . 
because they looked really nice . 
what do you looking for in those ? 
but what kind of things are you looking for ? 
i do n't think you can get dual side air bags . 
i 'd say the most important thing is a car that 's not going to fall apart . that does n't have problems . 
you set down . 
you look at consumer reports . 
we 've been pouring over consumer reports 
and then we kind of want a four door . 
what is your community currently doing with regard to recycling ? 
some local communities are very active in that respect 
but i live in a metropolitan area 
and they 're not too inclined to do something as aggressive as that . 
live in an apartment complex . 
i think a lot of the issues with regard to recycling are that people have to be motivated to do something like that because it does take extra effort . 
a bottle bill was passed 
and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now , 
and i 'm not going to throw a bottle away , 
it 's like throwing a nickel away . 
that type of thing . 
here they 're trying to push through a bill 
but people need to be more conscious of it . 
and a lot of people are against it . 
and it 's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell sodas and stuff . 
because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything . 
it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans . 
and matter of fact , i think it took three tries for it to go through . 
and it 's been pretty successful 
people would have a drink of soda , 
instead of throwing out the window , they keep the bottle 
so it 's been a ecologically sound policy as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth . 
and that 's the big thing that they try to promote . 
i think here instead of just requiring that you put out the trash and stuff , if they could get some kind of rebate , those people who do put the stuff out and separate it , have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate . 
that 's a good idea . 
there definitely has to be a motivation factor 
i work for a defense contractor . 
so , it 's incentives like that that get people more conscious of it . 
i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books . 
usually have them come from projects to collect old ones . 
usually just get dumped out with the trash . 
and phone books are a large volume of annual trash . 
the local schools , you could send your phone book with your kid to school 
because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that the telephone books are the type of thing that do n't break down over a long period of time . 
they contain the glue and stuff 
now i think they 've come up with some way of pulling the glue out . 
let 's see . 
how about about ten years ago , 
what do you think was different ten years ago from now ? 
i would say as , far as social changes go i think families were more together . 
they did more things together . 
they ate dinner at the table together . 
the parents usually took out more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity . 
although i 'm not a mother , i still think that a lot has changed since ten years ago . 
what do you think about that ? 
actually ten years from today seems rather short . 
but i do agree that generally society has sort of rushed everything ahead . 
and i do n't know , 
it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that . 
but i think that has a lot to do with economic situation . 
what about as far as social changes in the individual ? 
do you think that the individual has as much time as they did ten , twenty years ago ? 
. it depends . 
it 's hard to say because i think people were busy ten twenty years ago too . 
how old are you ? 
so there 's maybe a five year gap between us . 
i think that things have been busy all along . 
it 's just a matter . and that usually as far as families are concerned , there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home . 
and now it 's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work . 
do you think it 's an economic necessity 
or do you think that we 're , all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living ? 
i think that 's part of it too . 
do you think , people really need two cars and a house in the suburbs 
i do n't . 
i do n't think that . 
but then there are a lot of people that do n't have that . but , that really do need to work . 
and then there , is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that they think is surviving which is really more luxuries . 
but i tend to think that it 's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive . 
which group are you saying is the one trying ? 
i 'm saying that the group that is just trying to survive from day to day , where both parents are working is more of the majority than the people that have the higher standard of living . 
because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who i think that that 's , in my opinion , the case . 
i have met people that just want to maintain the standard of living and those that really need the job . 
i guess we 're sticking more to social changes 
but people want all of that 
and not all of those are necessities . 
it has become a necessity . 
sort of the reason we 're going through the school system 
i seem to be younger than most people who talk on this thing . 
i did n't really perceive much of a problem with the school system . 
and we look like we do n't have anything . 
it seems to be not difficult enough for students . not challenging enough . and just not generally competitive enough . 
i do n't know . 
and i 've seen things change . 
because i was n't really listening to the world go by back then 
so it 's hard to compare . 
you know what i mean ? 
i 've lived down here . 
i hear the dropout rates from the schools , 
and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year . 
and i begin to wonder if i 'm really getting my money 's worth . 
i 've seen so many different things . so many different bad reports coming out of the school system 
and i recognize that there are good schools out there . 
somebody 's getting a good education because we , continue to employ people . 
but i do n't understand , why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities . 
i do n't pretend to understand that either . 
but i 'm not quite sure that it 's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools . 
it 's high in those areas where also there 's poverty and crime . 
and they all seem to go together . 
and it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle , where you have the dropout rate and crime and general poverty kind of conditions , that things ought to get better . 
they 're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways . and clearly , to me , is a kind of government thing to fix 
but it 's just like , i do n't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like i do n't know . 
it 's a complicated issue . 
i still do n't think i would blame it directly on the school . 
i do n't know if i blame it on the school . 
i think i blame it on a couple of different things . 
i think i blame it on the school system . , 
that 's . 
they do quite well for themselves . 
that 's odd because i do n't think the teachers in my school district were well paid . 
not all school districts are well paid . 
but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid . 
they 're both teachers , 
and they both have second jobs that they work in the afternoons . 
they both work all summer full-time . 
that family is making over a hundred grand . 
i agree that teaching our kids is important . 
and they only work nine months a year 
and they get an awful lot of breaks in between 
and that 's my tax dollars that i 'm spending on that . 
and i do n't even have kids . 
that 's true . 
you can always play games with talking about , look at this . 
my tax dollars are paying for this . 
this is wrong . 
and there 's really not much you can directly do about that . 
you have other professional jobs 
and this is a profession . 
are you into the cowboys ? 
i 'm not , 
i have n't been , 
but i 'm still not a cowboys ' man . 
that 's all right . 
that 's my favorite team , 
they did n't do too bad last season . 
but , i hope they can do better . 
how about yourself ? 
i do n't know . 
i kind of go back and forth depending on who 's really hot and who 's not . 
i guess i 'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects . 
i kind of like them . 
that 's another one of my favorites . 
they 're not my favorite totally . 
but i do like them . 
to be honest with you , i probably watch college a little bit more than i do pro . 
i kind of like college actually . 
quite a bit . 
that 's kind of strange . 
it 's too much running for me in college football . 
i like the pros . 
is it ? 
that could be . 
when you 're getting paid millions to do it , i think they take it to another level . 
college football is a little bit different 
you probably would n't like my favorite team in college then . 
who 's that ? 
there 's a running team . 
that 's boring for me . 
i 'll take the passing teams any day . 
i can see definitely how you get into that . 
to be honest with you , i find that too much running gets pretty boring as well 
it 's four yards , three yards eight yards , tackle . 
i think they 're starting to realize that . 
a lot of the big eight teams that used to run so much . i think they 're starting to realize that they just ca n't compete anymore . 
it 's high dollar . 
it 's all money now . 
this world league is coming in ? 
that 's getting ready to start up ? 
have you followed that very much 
not really . 
i think it 's an institution . 
it 's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball . 
it can take over part of it . 
it can take over a small market share 
it 's going to take a little bit . 
some people are going to watch it 
it 's never going to reach that standard 
i think i agree with you . 
it 's kind of interesting to see their claim of world football . 
it 's kind of strange . 
i guess we 're the only ones , who take it that far . 
actually i kind of like soccer . 
i 've never really played it 
but i like the idea . 
it 's an interesting game to watch . 
whatever you want to call it there . 
that 's some brutal stuff there . 
that 's worse than football as far as violence i think . 
those guys kill each other out there . 
. 
that 's just wild . 
that 's why it 's a big college thing . 
so 
i could see the feel for that . 
but it 's fun to play . 
i 'll give it that . 
you 've played it then ? 
i doubt it . 
not in this country anyway . 
you ca n't stay healthy and do that . 
that 's a rough game . 
it is . 
but i do n't know . 
they really are . 
it 's kind of odd . 
do you know where that is ? 
i do n't . 
it 's a small town . 
to tell you the truth , i 'm not even really from here . 
you just live there now . 
but i do n't know . 
but , i do n't know , 
one of the things that i found to be an invasion is when i pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the , credit card bill . 
that is something that is not required 
and , in fact it is actually prohibited 
but it does n't stop many people from doing it . 
and it 's one of the things that it 's used for , primarily , is for demographic research . and to get your phone number on lists for phone solicitations . 
i 've always done that . 
once i found out that that 's really not necessary or legal then i just refuse 
and i say what are you going to do . 
you going to say you do n't want to sell me this product then that 's fine . 
i 'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all . 
and then , ultimately , they say , no 
you do n't have to put it down . 
but really it 's part of this compliance thing . 
i know that certain states actually sell their lists like motor vehicles . 
that really burns me because you 're required . 
you have to do that . 
and nowhere does it asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone . 
and i think that , it 's one thing to , voluntarily give it because someone asks . 
you can always refuse 
but it 's another thing where it 's required by law 
and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody , 
i do n't think they have the right to do that . 
i agree with you there . 
that 's something that people have seen . 
here 's an easy way to make some money . 
but i do n't know if that 's been challenged in the courts or not . 
i 've heard , fairly recently some talk about that in my state . 
the budget problems up here are pretty tense . 
enhancing revenue is the phrase they use . 
and the last i heard they 'd backed down from that idea . 
but it really makes you wonder what other lists you 're own that have been made public that you , do n't know about . 
that 's easy . 
whenever you donate money to someone ? 
you become , put on something like a sucker list 
and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations . 
it kind of makes you feel from doing it again . 
like national public radio or any of the public stations . 
and it just started soon after i had done that one . 
and i just said this is terrible . 
and that 's also happened to me where i 've given money to my old alma mater in college . 
and it 's one thing , 
they do n't sell the list . 
and they call you up 
and they actually happen to be people who graduated in your class or something like that . 
and they say , we know you . 
you had contributed x amount last year . 
can you do better this year ? 
and hold on here . 
how do you know that ? 
how do you know that ? 
why you even telling me this ? 
is it any of your business ? 
it 's one thing that i , and the college knows that 
that 's , just our business . 
there 's no need for someone who is soliciting should know at all . 
and that was very offensive too . 
i do n't know . 
and he is still living by himself . 
my grandmother died a couple of years ago . 
but he does n't want to move away . 
and he recently had to have an operation 
but he just really does n't want to go to a nursing home . 
is he able to still do everything himself pretty well ? 
he was until this operation . 
and now i do n't really think he 's doing that well . 
and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot . 
but my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three . 
and died six weeks after they put him in the home . 
and i 'm sure that kind of thing would influence your grandfather 's feelings . 
because i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of , do they still have some of their life left . 
and , for , a lot of people going into a nursing home it 's like saying my life is over 
and i 'm just here for the rest of the stay . 
and so i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home , it 's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs . 
they can look after a lot of things 
but there 's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore . 
i know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home . 
they generally were able to have someone care for them at home 
and they died . 
but they were all younger than your grandparents . 
i guess when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically . , 
but i just do n't think that nursing homes really do a very good job . 
and that 's difficult part . 
because i think what they often get used as is almost like a very high level or long-term care similar to a hospital . 
and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care . generally are not able to look after themselves to a very great extent , physically . 
but i think that it can be helpful in that it gets people the level of physical care they need . , 
at least i think some nursing homes do that . 
but i think a lot of nursing homes really are guilty of neglect . 
and i think it happens more in areas where it 's a broad social medical system where there 's government medical care and that kind of thing . 
if it 's the lot where it 's funded by the individuals 
and i guess that 's sort of my lack of understanding . 
but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay . 
actually , to tell you the truth , i think jury selection is a prime discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on finding of guilt . 
i certainly ca n't argue with that . 
definitely does need some improvements . 
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to . 
i think there 's a limit on that . 
the , peremptory challenges are limited to , i do n't know how many , 
i think it 's , four or five , 
but you can , 
i ca n't remember which . 
i was on a jury trial last year 
only i got kicked out as the last selection that the defense got . 
i think i have a severe demeanor or something . 
but typically , everyone gets involved in the jury process 
but it still has to be a group of your peers . 
so , that 's why the defense is there picking through them , whereas at the same time the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him a guilty verdict if the facts warrant . 
so i think the jury selection process is pretty neat , 
but i do n't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards . 
i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have . 
you 're talking about , the person 's already been found guilty 
the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever , 
but i think that it should be up to the judge and the lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be . 
maybe just the judge because they 're the people who know what the system is and what it 's all about and believe in the system . 
and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure . as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure . also , may be a more consistent sentencing procedure . 
i suppose you may be right on that . 
preceding criminal record , according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime . 
and the jury 's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury . 
is it ? 
i did n't realize that . 
not during the trial , 
during the trial as to whether they 're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background . 
but when it comes to what kind of sentence you 're going to lay down , i think that they should . 
i do n't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial . 
they get too boring . 
so , what you 're saying is this , if there is the second offense , then you execute them . 
if it 's a second offense , the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense , because obviously , the rehabilitation process did not work the first time . 
so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better . 
when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing , i 'm all for that for small crimes , infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant , 
you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things . 
what about white collar crimes like theft of trade secrets . 
i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are . 
like what ? 
what do you think ? 
actually , i do n't think they 're out of line . 
but you are trying to avoid paying taxes 
and whether or not you agree with that law , you 're still circumventing it . 
what if you 're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though ? 
what if you do n't even realize that you 're subject to paying income tax on something that you purchase mail order ? 
i do n't think that 's a valid argument . 
i think that most people are quite aware they 're not paying that six percent sales tax . 
but then why not pay the sales tax . 
corporations have to , 
why should an individual just because the state ca n't really find out about it , be able to avoid paying sales tax ? 
it 's because i ca n't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area . 
so i go outside the area for that . 
i do n't think that that 's my responsibility as a conscientious consumer . 
i 'll agree it 's not your responsibility 
is it also legal , for you to do that ? 
from what i understand from various net readings , the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes into place in the next few years . 
it is a lost revenue stream right now 
and states can use all the revenue they can get . 
with something like that , do your arguments still apply ? 
i think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then i do n't argue with it . 
because it 's not a burden on the consumer to remember that i bought this out of state . 
which is exactly what businesses do at the present . 
but the point is is that businesses do that . 
the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . 
that 's a cost of doing business . 
the burden should n't be placed on the consumer . 
and i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having to pay sales tax on it . 
that 's my understanding of the way it works . 
usually , the person ordering does n't pay . 
and there are some substantial , nasty penalties if businesses try to avoid that . 
do you mean businesses from the point of view of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax ? or purchasing . 
and i know they work that way here in d c . 
i 'm unfamiliar with that because i never see that end of the business . 
so , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . 
but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something can be avoided . 
that 's true . 
a big hole does exist right now in that consumers can just say i forgot that . 
there is no well defined mechanism at all 
and that it is a loss . is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just in order to gain the revenue that 's being lost . 
i do n't know if i agree with that . 
your turn . 
i do n't think they should abolish it . 
i think if they put it into force more often , they would n't have as many problems as they 've got . 
but not for petty theft ? 
i do n't think it should just be used loosely . 
it should be used as a deterrent do you think ? 
or should it be used to prevent further crime ? 
to prevent these people from ever getting out on the street . by some technicality . 
and they go down the line ten years 
and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before . 
and that 's about the only thing . 
i guess , if it was someone in my family , i 'd probably feel that way . 
i 've never had anybody in my immediate family murdered 
and so i really would n't know . 
but i feel like if i did , i probably would feel that way . 
one of the things i was thinking about is , from society 's point of view , if you put a value on each person , what you want to do is to maximize the end game value . 
so if you have someone that destroys that value then you want to take steps to minimize the loss . 
of course , you have to also put value on the criminal . 
so if you terminate him , that 's a loss of value . 
that 's true . 
if you do n't terminate him , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person . 
in other words , you 'd have to murder more than one other person in order to justify taking his life . 
besides him . 
another way you could do it is weight this value by the value to society of the people . which is pretty delicate thing to do . 
but one way of doing it is by income . 
so if this guy does n't make a great deal of money , which is often times the case , then he 's obviously not worth very much 
his life is n't worth very much then . 
and so the likelihood that maybe expected murders by him is , integrated over the income of the people that he murders is maybe a loss of eight hundred thousand dollars . 
but if integrated income over the expected remainder of his life is small , less than eight hundred thousand dollars , then you terminate him . 
i suppose you could say , that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation . 
potential . 
that 's the key right there . potential . 
that 's all fine and well and , good philosophical . 
but if you 're involved yourself , personally 
and let me tell you , i knew them personally not intimately , but quite well 
and you 're talking about real trauma trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies . 
i can imagine . 
of course , a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get in terms of psychological impact . 
was he murdered ? 
did they find who killed him ? 
they found him 
and he is on trial for capital murder . 
so it has n't been a long time ago . 
just recently . 
actually he was convicted , 
and , of course , now you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process 
that appeals process it 's what just drags out and out and out . 
one way or another we 're now recording . 
home repair . 
you were helping your parents . 
i still am really . 
and we 've done lots to it . 
you 're remodeling ? 
how about you ? 
i live in an apartment now . 
and i went with a friend of mine 
and we undertook a building house . 
and we , started from an empty lot with trees and stuff on it 
and we had to cut them down and clear the lot . 
we had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement . pour the basement 
and went from the ground up . 
it was a fun time 
but i thought , summer time . 
and one thing is that we were going to pour the basement foundation . 
and we 're in the process 
and it started pouring down rain . 
and i guess we had most of it done 
what happened was that a lot of water settled on the top 
and it really did n't give a very good finish 
it was sort of sandy and not a very good finish . 
but it was okay 
and it 's only the basement floor 
so it was okay . 
but it kept us pretty busy . 
there was me and my friend 
it was n't a commercial project or something . 
it was sort of just get my brother and maybe my cousin 's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing . so that the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes . 
and then materials coming in 
and so we 're hopping around pretty good . 
but overall we got it done 
and it 's a three bedroom , two bath house 
and it 's pretty neat . 
nice . 
nice . 
what was it for ? 
it was for my friend 's parents . 
they had some property there 
it 's sort of like a farm , you might say . 
and they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something . 
and his mom just wanted a new house , 
that has been her dream . 
and so , we did that . 
and she was really pleased with it . 
so it came 
that 's great . 
where you live it gets very hot ? 
it does . 
and the windows what type of windows are you putting in ? 
because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in the solar game ? 
what , are you putting in 
we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass . 
my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it . 
and it 's had several owners and stuff 
did it go up and down ? 
i see . 
and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there . 
there 's a problem with those . 
they usually most of the time do n't open very well . 
ours did n't . 
and the ones that would open would n't want to stay open . 
and it causes the glass to crack 
and it 's a never ending problem . 
i have n't been in any really home repair things lately . 
what do you usually do as far as budgeting ? 
we have a very detailed budget . because my husband is a finance major . 
and we have money that we take out each month for food and for gas and things like that . 
then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year 
and we budget them into what we call our needs and wants list . 
we have a vacation fund . 
we have a fund for the things we need . and then for the things that we want . 
and we 're continually putting into those each month how much we 're going to need 
and then we know the month that we 're going to have enough to get that particular item . 
so we very rarely buy anything on credit . 
everything we buy is paid for . 
my husband is a finance major also . 
and we kind of have the same plan . 
we have one credit card 
and every month we put the same amount in for retirement . 
and our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby . 
so we 're , budgeting each month an allowance for his education starting now . 
so that 's in our budget every month now . 
that 's the newest addition . 
we have a set amount 
so an , exact amount that we spend on that each year . 
we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money . instead of just writing checks for things . 
if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here . 
i see . 
you have a separate account for that then ? 
a lot of that i do n't know how safe it is . 
i guess we keep it all in a safe here at the house . 
i see . 
and so it 's actually pulled out . 
i see . 
we have a savings account for the kids ' education . 
that money goes into there . 
we have three children . 
so they each have their own account . 
i see . 
that money is put into each month . 
does your husband deal in stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff ? 
does he invest in that and for long-term ? 
he does somewhat . 
he does somewhat . 
we have an investment plan . 
i guess he does . 
this is the first year we 've done it this way . 
and we are really saving a lot of money . 
what goes into that particular thing ? 
we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental 
we have it . 
and when we see something on sale instead of just looking in our checking account and saying we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill . everything 's taken care of . 
and we 're finding that we even have more money than we thought . 
do you run the family budget as far as groceries and that sort of thing ? 
i do . 
all the money . 
and what 's that ? 
all the money is turned over to me . 
do you have a set amount that you spend each month 
or how do you work that ? 
i have a set amount . 
it 's very generous 
and i usually have extra . 
and so then that can go either back into our checking account 
or i can just carry it over . 
there are certain months of the year that you 'll spend more on food than other months . and certain times when that will be left over . 
but that 's completely up to me how i do that . 
i stay home . 
i do too . 
i stay home also . 
and so it 's kind of my money 
we have a clothing envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing . 
it really works out great . 
we 're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that . 
we have a household budget . 
and also , we need a new bed . 
and so we 've got both of those budgeted 
and we put a certain amount in each month 
and we know which month we 'll . 
recently graduated from high school . meaning three or four years ago . 
i 'm a senior in , college now . 
i 'm a junior in college now . 
i got a friend who goes there , by the way . 
i want to talk to you about that afterward , 
the high school i went to was a good one also . 
and i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools . 
it 's more or less a suburban school system ? 
that was true for mine too . 
although i 'm sure to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , 
but i honestly do n't think that 's the biggest part of it . 
i know that in my town most of the parents , they valued education . 
and so the students were to some extent , motivated to learn . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
i think maybe it 's started changing in the past few years because they have these sort of mandatory , tests you have to take before you get a diploma . 
but , certainly before that , there were people that would graduate from high school and could barely read . 
and that 's just sort of inexcusable 
i just ca n't even picture how that could happen except maybe to someone who 's really badly learning disabled or something . 
but these people obviously were n't . 
when i went to elementary school it was n't in a great area 
i guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people . 
and i think that 's almost a bigger factor , than anything else probably . 
so , i guess the thing to do is to try to get some kind of motivation to learn 
i think it 'd be interesting to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school . sort of maybe from elementary through high school just sort of to get a feel for what it 's like . 
i think that 'd be an interesting experience . 
but i have n't done that . 
i ca n't say that i have either . 
but i do think that public education in general can work . 
and i think it 's a good thing . 
i 've heard statistics and things that compare a public education to a private education within the same income groups . 
if you compare the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that , did send their kids to private schools . 
i think they compare fairly well . 
i honestly do n't really think i could have done much better than i did in the school system i was in . 
once i got into high school , they had a lot of accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that . 
that makes a big difference 
once you start junior high , starting in eighth grade all the way through high school , there were four levels . 
i guess in junior high , it was still three . 
actually i think that works pretty well . 
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley . 
and there 's been a lot of population growth around here . 
and it 's getting worse . 
i think most of it is from cars . 
and it just sits and sits and sits 
it 's almost sad . 
i live in the , university district 
and it 's supposed to have about the worst air pollution . 
i think probably due to a lot of students going back and forth to school . 
and then we 're right next to interstate five also . 
they 've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you 're in certain counties , 
emissions . 
have they started doing that yet ? 
population is a lot lighter up here . 
we have that here 
and they 're expanding it to more counties here . as the population spreads out 
and i think they 're also going to be making it mandatory for more cars . 
there was something in the law about if your car was over a certain age , like over twenty years old , you did n't have to get it done anymore . 
and i think they 're eliminating that loophole . 
they 're eliminating that out here . 
kind of like a radar gun . 
you mean they could do that remotely ? 
what they do , they do several different types of things . 
sometimes they put a source light 
and they look at the source light 
and then as the car goes by , you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it 
and you can look at the emissions actually . 
where does the source light go ? 
across the street . 
they 'll set up a trap or something like that in some sense . 
i see . 
it 's an incredible amount . 
it was four hundred times as much of certain pollutants then a properly tuned car . 
that 's neat . 
everybody is talking about using more mass transient here 
but it 's tough . 
i 've looked into riding the bus to work 
but if i take the bus , it requires several transfers 
and it takes over an hour . 
so it 's not hard to see why i keep driving . 
we 're supposed to talk about recycling . 
basically , what your personal opinion is on it . 
this is really for a speech research project they 're doing 
so i do n't know . 
they did ? 
they had been doing it , 
not quite , 
it 's county wide program now . 
and what they 've done is they 've broken everything down into garbage . yard trash . plastic , cans and glass . and then paper . 
that 's good . 
let me ask you this . 
and they 'd just sort it out for you . 
it was really pretty good if you 're lazy like i am , 
i talked to this girl 
what is the name of that company . 
we were talking one day 
and she asked me a couple of questions . 
what she said . 
that 's what recycling at home sorting does . 
it 's a little extra work . 
you put your garbage in a garbage bag 
and you set it out by the curb . 
if you have yard trash , you put your yard trash in some kind of container . 
or you can have bundles up to a certain weight , and certain dimensions , tie them up and put them by the curb . 
you got to tie them up and everything . 
and it 's about a foot and a half deep 
and it 's about one by one and a half foot wide and long . 
this is a little container . 
and then they have another one the same size . 
that one 's red . 
then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods . 
otherwise you got bees and ants 
and if you 've got food containers or anything like that , it 's a big problem . 
that 's true . 
up here , they give you one of those containers 
and you put everything in it . 
this is true . 
so it 's kind of a pain in the butt . 
this is true . 
but i do n't know . 
you have those garbage people that , make twenty , thirty bucks an hour , 
have them do a little bit of the sorting and maybe come up with a better system . 
make it a little more convenient . 
they 've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here . if you want to have a nice garbage can . 
and it 's on wheels 
and it 's big . 
you can actually rent those ? 
that 's interesting . 
up here the city provides them . 
i think in the city they do 
but out here in the county you have to rent them . 
and they just add it on to your water bill or something . 
. i listen to this talk radio station down here 
i do n't 
occasionally . 
but they get into some really good conversations sometimes . 
and some of it , sometimes it 's serious 
and they have some good feedback and all that stuff 
and this kind of fits into the aid program , 
the welfare program that 's going on right now . 
your turn . 
i start . 
we keep a budget to an extent . 
and we were really forced into keeping a budget because i 'm paid once a month which sort of forces some restrictions 
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid . 
about yourself ? 
i have to say i really do n't have a budget . 
both my wife and i grew up in families of rather modest means 
and our family income , at this point , is comfortable . upper middle class i guess you might say . 
and we 're both so frugal that we really do n't need a budget . 
i guess that really is sort of keeping a budget , . 
you stay within your means . 
we stay within our means 
but we do n't do it by conscious effort . 
it just sort of happens automatically . 
so that presents a real shock . 
and it 's a beautiful place to live . 
so budget is not a problem for us . 
at least it has n't been . 
it may be at this point . 
but up until this point it really has n't been . 
when i was in undergraduate school a long , long time ago , i noted that the starting average monthly salary for engineers in my discipline , was six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that . 
and i noted at that point that if that 's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever . 
so i stopped worrying about money . 
never have worried about money since then . 
that 's a system too . 
sometimes it 's a bit of a problem because i guess i do n't really manage my money the way i should . 
but i suppose i 've lost money on not taking good advantage of , investments 
then again you said you are able to take trips . 
and you do , obviously , have enough to live on 
so that 's a form of budgeting . 
it 's kind of a strange topic for two people who do n't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money . 
i guess we 're both lucky in that regard then . 
how big is your family ? 
we have one on the way . 
i see . 
i think it 's just going to be one . 
how about yourself ? 
i have two kids . 
and they are beginning to be a budget problem but have not been really up to this point . 
do they budget at all ? 
do you have them on an allowance ? 
i give them an allowance 
i basically give my son ten dollars a week 
and i put half of it in the bank 
and i give him the other half in cold cash . 
and he has a teller card so he can do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank . 
but , at least , it is n't burning a hole in his pocket . 
if he wants to use it , he has to go get it 
actually 
you do n't believe in it ? 
i would n't say that . 
i think i would have said that a few years ago . 
when i was younger i thought it was a sign of a civilized society if you did n't have capital punishment 
but , maybe slowly changing my opinion . 
i 'm not thoroughly opposed to it . 
i still think it 's sort of true that a more civilized society would n't have to use capital punishment 
but i 'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought . 
you sound a lot like a friend of mine . a girl i hang out with . 
she has very black and white opinions . 
there 's no gray in her opinions . 
she probably would agree more with you 
but i do n't know . 
i think i would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again . 
i 've never had a punishment or a crime like a murder touch my immediate family 
but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish , especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they 've done . 
and we see that more and more . 
in our state right now , there 's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl 
that 's fourteen years old . 
what 's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult . 
i certainly do n't advocate turning people like that loose . 
i 'm not sure executing them does anymore than keeping them in jail , 
it does n't 
but , it costs less . 
that 's a factor . 
and 
to me it is . 
i work 
and i pay my taxes 
and we 'd get along just fine . 
the cost is something 
but i think it 's relatively unimportant compared to what 's the most effective way of , dealing with crime 
i do n't know , 
and they do n't have a crime problem either . 
and they do n't have the crime problems we do . 
i do n't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two . 
you might be right . 
i 'd hate to be the person to pull the switch , 
i would never in a million years want that job 
but i do believe it 's necessary 
and i could n't pull the switch 
i think it just becomes a symbolic i 'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians 
i would like for it to be settled once for all and get in the background while the more important issues get discussed , 
like i said , some years ago , i think i would have said there 's no place for capital punishment in the , civilized western country . 
i 'm not so sure of that . 
i would n't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around . 
what 's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing ? 
maybe it 's more a symbolic gesture than anything else 
and i 've also never been a victim although i have two friends whose wives were murdered 
and i can imagine that for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case . 
we do n't even have to cook dinner anymore . 
but i 've heard that a lot of families really do n't spend a great deal of time together . 
the kids maybe on the average get something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents . 
that 's what i 've heard too . 
it seems bizarre to me . 
i do n't quite understand it , although i think probably the worst thing that 's happening in , at least the modern world today , is television . 
i know it . 
i tell myself sometimes , just sit down after work , 
so i refuse to have one in the house . 
good for you . 
good for you . 
i talk to a lot of people about that 
and i 've thought about it myself 
and i though about it a lot 
but i still have n't done it yet . 
that 's good . 
i 'll tell you . 
television sure makes child rearing easy on you . 
and you do n't have to worry about them . 
that 's true 
i 've noticed that . 
but i do n't think it 's too good . 
i do n't think so either . 
so i do n't know , 
i do n't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids , 
but i take advantage of dinner time . 
we always eat together 
do you keep your kids active in sports or anything 
i guess our big outlet is music . 
and when our son started playing violin , i took up violin 
so there 's plenty of interactive time in practicing . although neither kid likes to practice . 
i guess that 's not a big surprise . 
not for kids . 
i try and read to them 
and i take them to the park and stuff 
and . 
reading is so good . 
i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little 
they get to that stage . 
have you ever seen that yet ? 
sleep book , 
it 's called a sleep book 
and you ought to get it . 
i think his sleep book is my favorite . 
i like to do it 
and they enjoy reading . 
i never read a lot growing up 
and i never read until a few years ago 
i just started picking up books 
and so i 've found that it 's really important to me to get to read . 
, i like to get away in a book ? 
so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day ? 
i probably spend an hour or two . 
that 's great . 
my wife works at night , 
so she 's gone a lot at nights 
and so i spend a lot of time with them . 
i see . 
how old are your kids again ? 
they 're two and one . 
two and one . 
so you have your hands full with them , 
that 's for sure . 
so what things do you consider an invasion of privacy ? 
i do n't know . 
what do you think ? 
i do n't know . 
i had a little bit more time to think about it . 
i do n't know , 
i started to think about all the big data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and all those demographics studies that they do that , have , who knows , how much stuff about all the purchases that you 've made and everything kept tract somewhere 
and i do n't know , 
i do n't know what they actually have in there 
but i know they sell those , 
what about required drug testing as a condition of employment ? 
that was the other one i was thinking of . 
i know drugs are illegal . 
and they instituted a drug testing policy where they randomly would test employees 
and actually , to tell you the truth , i really did not think much about it . 
i had n't , 
it really did n't relate to me . 
but there were some things that people brought up like what happens if they get a false positive what recourse do you have . 
and , also this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity 
so what that means is , to me , that really it 's the government that 's requiring this , 
i think that , a person 's competence should be more determined by their actions and their behavior 
and if they 're on some kind of controlled substance then it kinds of takes away from the job of the supervisor or manager type person who is able to evaluate them . 
i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a chemical , 
these people that are carriers and that do n't reveal it ? 
that would be kind of an extreme . 
so what about that as an invasion of privacy ? 
so 
it gets to balancing personal freedom against the general welfare of society . 
i guess that 's been the big role of government generally . 
it 's supposed to have been . 
that 's kind of a difficult one to go into . 
i mean that particular case . 
it , 
they could require obligatory aids testing for everyone because there 's a huge part of the population , 
a growing part . 
the aids population that have it , that do n't know they do are spreading it . 
but , again , to require such a test and then to make it is to subject them to discriminatory practices and other things . 
i do n't know , 
i do n't know how exactly i feel about that . 
go ahead . 
i think public service is a worthy thing 
and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs such as peace corps that promote that . 
and you have to do a public service project . in which leadership is the key element . 
i think that might be referring to something , kind of alternative to the draft . 
of course military service falls under the category of a public service . 
and , so one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft . 
but i agree with you , 
there are other things such as civil service which many people are lifelong employees of 
but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either . 
more of a voluntary kind of thing 
say , you can go into the military 
or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things . 
and it 's interesting because i 'm not a particular fan of the military 
but i have seen a lot of young guys go in that do n't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and are n't terribly disciplined even just personal discipline about what they want to do 
and they come out 
and now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline . 
and it 's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn . that they do n't need to be cowboys . 
and for some young men , that 's good . 
for me , it would have been lousy idea , because i did have the personal discipline . 
why ? 
and i went to college for four years and got out , 
why is that ? 
but , for some people that 's good . 
i do n't like the fact that it 's the military 
that 's one view . 
and that 's another debate . 
and it seems pretty aggressive oriented , 
so , at any rate , this is getting off the topic 
how do you feel about the crime in your city ? 
i know that there 's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders . 
that 's kind of gone up in scale and some other things . 
i personally had a little experience the other day . 
somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck . 
i have a good friend there . 
here the real problems are the gangs . 
a lot of murders , 
we 've only been here a couple of years . 
i wo n't go to the grocery store at night . 
you know . 
and it 's that kind of thing 
we have a neighborhood watch program in the development that we live in , which i think is a great way to reduce home theft , burglary , and things of that sort . 
do you have that where you live 
and then i go back down in may . 
we 've been broken into in my apartment about four times in two and a half weeks . 
and one of the things that i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there . 
it 's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work , 
but 
i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it , that 's a good way to work it , with a neighborhood watch . 
also i 've heard that the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they 're home . like on the weekends . 
is that right ? 
they know the house is unlocked 
and then they just slip in . 
slip in , slip out . 
that 's amazing . 
they know exactly what they 're going for . 
so , i 've heard that 's really on the rise as far as a new type of crime . 
it almost seems like they 're getting quite a bit smarter . 
unfortunately . 
unfortunately it 's starting to really look at people 's habits and where they are at particular points of the day . 
and the crime level there , of course , is quite a bit , more pronounced , 
but . 
i guess , 
i 'm not real sure . 
it helps to know your neighbors . 
you 're supposed to make lists of cars . 
i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development . 
if i see a car that 's unfamiliar , we have a list 
pretty much . 
i was basically , involved in that , in the organization of it . 
and then i left right in the middle of it . 
i 'm not sure where we went from there , 
you hate to be paranoid 
but there are really only so many things you can do . 
you can have the house alarm , uh neighborhood watch program as a woman not go out at night 
you can do that which is what i choose to do . 
one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited 
even if you know that the threat is there it 's against the law to set traps , 
it 's against the law to do a lot of things . 
that 's not always true . 
it is n't ? 
there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed 
the guy came in while he was home 
and , sure enough , he fell into the trap and was severely burned . 
he did n't die , 
but he was severely burned 
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement . 
so that makes you think . 
it 's like your hands are very much tied . 
i should say something . 
but , i 'm the least informed person in the whole united states . 
this has not been determined yet 
but i 've never read a newspaper in my entire life 
any particular reason ? . 
they 've tried to lock me up and things like that . 
but i 'm basically not interested 
what am i trying to say . , 
i do learn about things . largely from friends 
someone will write a book about something 
and then i 'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier . 
and anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i do n't have much confidence in it . 
but i do n't think it 's just that i 'm lazy . 
i really do n't , 
and i guess you could explain it two ways . 
and the cynical view is , these things are n't doing a very good job at all . 
and i think the same thing is true with news . 
if you were deeply involved in it , then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they 're not printing because the average person does n't need or want to know that much . 
i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them . 
there 's a reasonable question as to whether it 's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things . 
and most people think it is 
and i can , accept that some people think it 's not and can find better ways to use it . 
i do n't think it 's that high . 
you do n't ? 
and i think they 're saying if something 's really important , i 'll at least find out that it happened . 
and that is a reasonable start 
and for awhile i did n't read a newspaper when i came out here because i did n't find one that i liked . 
and i could then go and pick up newspapers if it were important enough to read about . 
something that you cared about happened , you 'd find out from friends or other channels . 
that 's the closest thing . 
i deeply cared about that . 
and i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine 
and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on . 
but even then , i did n't end up doing it on my own . , 
i stayed as far away from those as i could . 
i decided i did n't want to waste the time 
probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water 
if they sink they 're innocent . 
i see . 
a good southern solution . 
how do you feel ? 
you 'd have to say that . 
i do n't know . 
the things they asked to talk about were whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing . 
and seems to me that i think that 's the way it 's done now . 
at least , my understanding of the law which is n't very good . 
it seems to me that the judge does it 
and i think that 's probably all right in that they maybe know what the norm is for a particular thing . 
and , i guess , also what the system will absorb . 
probably more tuned in to that . 
possibly though on capital cases like maybe the death penalty 
he could have a personal prejudice . 
that 's right . 
and i think that may be an exception as well . 
does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge ? 
i think that 's the way it is . 
they decide whether or not the accused or whatever would get the death penalty . 
in fact , they 're going to execute somebody at the end of this month . 
and there 's a big uproar going on right now . 
something like that , i 've got no problem with it . 
i guess the way i think about it it should n't necessarily be thought of as revenge . 
put it to sleep . 
just get it out , 
it 's not able to fit in . 
something inexpensive . 
if somebody gets the death penalty , they 're judged guilty , 
they got the death penalty , 
they should have one year and one appeal . cover all their bases with one appeal 
but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake 
and you 'd hate to be one of those . 
i 'm sure . 
maybe not . 
i do n't know . 
at least in capital cases i 'd think they 'd have to be unanimous . 
i believe it is in capital . 
i think in lesser cases it 's ten out of twelve or five out of six , whatever . how ever many is sitting on a jury . 
i believe that 's the way it is . 
but i 'm pretty sure you 're correct on capital cases . 
and they say they 're hopelessly deadlocked . 
and the judge told them , they were n't hopelessly deadlocked yet . 
i 'm telling you , go one way or the other . 
that 's probably an expensive trial . 
six months so far they said . 
probably . 
probably . 
i 'm not sure there 's a number . 
maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their vote . 
that has been going on . 
so she follows that stuff pretty closely . 
that 's interesting . 
she 's not involved in that case . 
but she does , 
have you ever served on a jury ? 
i have n't . 
i never have . 
my wife has 
but i have n't . 
i got called 
but i never got selected for a jury , 
i sat for ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process , 
and they had some guy that was defending himself . 
go ahead . 
have you every been tested for a new job or anything ? 
i have n't . 
but , in my job , i 'm a nurse , 
this is the rules that they can do this anytime . 
i do n't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested . 
they can if they choose to . 
have you had any experience with it at all ? 
not really 
but i 've always worked on a university level 
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff . 
so what do you think about that ? 
i do n't think they 're very accurate 
and i know they changed afterwards . 
i know of that too . 
and you can not get a job because of it 
and they may not tell you the reason why . 
i had a friend , 
it did n't cause her any problems with her job 
but what it was , was she had been , in the jungle 
and it was some malaria medication 
and she tested positive for that . 
and so it really is a dangerous thing that way 
because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and did n't get the job 
and they were n't told why . 
but a lot of people say the reason why , after you take a physical , will be because of the drug testing 
or they would tell you . 
or this person never use any drugs . 
i thought you got called back if you tested positive , for more tests . 
you should . 
because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something . 
i have real mixed feelings about it . 
i do n't know . 
do you know how wrong they are ? 
is there a margin of error ? 
the accuracy ? 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know . 
but , i know there are a lot of things that can influence them 
and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . 
i interviewed for a job recently 
and my doctor gave me a prescription for it . 
and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive , you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you . 
and it did n't come up that i needed to do it 
but this could happen to anybody 
and if they would just say this person 's drug test is positive we wo n't hire them then you could lose out on a job when really you did n't do anything . 
so i do n't know . 
and i 'm not so sure they are that needed . 
i 'm not sure either . 
the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it , then they have the right to go ahead and prove it 
because they say they can spot check . 
if you 're using it while at a job , i can see a problem . 
but the occasional person , then it 's almost an infringement of your privacy . 
it sort of is . 
and this is it , 
i 'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways . 
as a health professional , i would n't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs . 
so as a patient , i feel we probably should be protected . 
but , on the other hand , there 's a lot of things i should be protected from that they do n't test my patients for too . 
so i guess you have to have trust some place along the way . 
you ca n't go around testing everybody for everything . 
so , i do n't know . 
if someone was out to get you , i think that a company or a boss could use this . 
they could keep on doing this to you or something , i guess . 
i can see where it could become a problem . 
and it seems like now they have tests 
i guess they can test your hair 
and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago . 
but maybe you should n't be held responsible for something you did several years ago . 
i know . 
that 's the other thing . 
a lot of people as kids or young people get into some things that they get out of later on 
and i do n't think they should really have to pay for that forever . 
there 's a lot of things you do as a kid that you would n't do as an adult 
but you ca n't say it was wrong at the time . 
i think that 's true . 
so that probably would n't be too good either . 
our discussion 's about the care of the elderly ? 
that 's right , 
that 's right . 
what do you think is important ? 
i do n't know how old you are , 
but if you had , parents or grandparents , whatever it is who were ready , who you thought might benefit from a nursing home , what do you think you would look for ? 
and he lives by himself 
and he 's in good shape . 
but some friends of mine have gone through this . 
do you have any experience with this yourself ? 
and we go there once a year . 
so we 're pretty far away . 
the environment there , i do n't know too much about it 
but it seems nice enough . 
it 's hard , 
at least half of the residents are not mentally sound . 
from the lack of stimulation , you mean . 
i do n't know . 
we also , my wife and i volunteer to go to a nursing home that 's just a mile from our house . 
she goes more often than i . 
we used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there . 
and we have a two year old son 
and so sometimes we 'd take him with us . 
and there i would say it 's the same thing . 
it 's a relatively nice environment 
but again it must be depressing for the people who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but , certainly have retained all of their mental skills and so on . 
it must be depressing to walk the halls and see all these other people who really do n't know where they are . 
do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with , that the people who operate it seem to have , what you 'd perceive of as genuine concern ? 
i think they 're relatively respectful . and concerned in as much as they can be . 
i 'm sure that the staff learn what 's normal for this person 
and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person 's needs is really because this person is just in a state where they do n't really need what they think they need . 
it 's possible , 
i was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor in just having to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need . 
i 'll tell you one thing though that i saw that was really nice . 
we saw a husband and wife , 
we used to see a husband and wife in there together 
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were 
but these two were . 
and when you walked into their room , they had brought all their furniture from their house 
so it gives them a sense of identity . 
you walked in there 
and it did n't look like how , you walk into some rooms and it 's completely generic . 
there 's nothing , maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person 
and that 's it . 
and they had all their stuff from their house 
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them 
i think part of what you 're saying matches what i have read . 
but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because they provide a lot of social activities . 
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation . 
i think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there 
how are you ? 
you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget ? 
but i 've two kids and all . 
but i 've never had a budget 
and i do n't do any planning 
and i do n't know , 
i do n't have a long-term financial plan . 
i do n't try to control my expenses . 
but i 'm glad you 're a stranger . 
that sounds kind of like me . 
but , really i 'm curious how other people live . 
so maybe we should start with you . 
what do you do ? 
about the same thing . 
maybe they 're going to arrest us both . 
i 'm even in worse shape because i have eight children 
and we live from hand to mouth . 
we hope that there 's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills 
a couple of times we 've tried some things 
and they worked 
but i 'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it . 
the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took my check and divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope 
and when the envelope was empty , then you did n't have any more money to spend in that area . 
and that worked out real well cause we did n't have to keep writing down what we 'd spent . 
it was just that when that was empty , you knew you were out of money . 
and we did that pretty successfully for about three months 
and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope 
and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do . 
and this was a sort of a career shift at the time 
and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that . 
and i actually did , 
i kept bouncing checks , just at the end of the month 
but i had miscalculated . 
i did n't keep a balance . 
it 's one of the problems . 
i never had to in the past . 
i always kept plenty of money in my checking account , 
things would get to tight . 
and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet 
and every time i spent money cash mostly , i would write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning . 
but i would forget to write the things down 
and i do n't know if i ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data . 
i even find now with the automatic tellers , i 'll go take money out of that 
and then i forget to take that out of my checking account . 
so i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account 
and i figure that , so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what 's really there . 
and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make . 
i have to say that , 
let 's see , 
at this point on , i do n't run out of money . 
and i do n't 
and i think my strategy if i may , is to not spend money . 
i do n't have expensive tastes . 
i do n't go out . 
i buy a car , 
people were embarrassed for me . 
it was a good car 
but it was still running . 
it was great . 
and it just would n't stop . 
i just did n't feel the need for a new car . 
it is n't like i could n't afford one . 
i tend to eat expensive food . 
i do n't mind buying a good steak 
but for me , i only do that every week or , maybe once a month . 
you buy , less than half a pound 
so it 's six or seven dollars . 
to me , i realize if you have eight kids you 're not going to run out and do that . 
not very often . 
but i 'm just saying as a single person , that 's a drop in the bucket . 
and so if you 're extravagant on how you buy food , it does n't add up . if you 're not going to super expensive restaurants , which i do n't care to go to . 
that 's right . 
so that 's one of the reasons i do n't need to budget is that i do n't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i ca n't afford it , because i 'm not interested in that expensive thing . 
what sort of company do you work for ? 
do you work for a big or a little place ? 
i work for the research facility . 
and it 's kind of small in a sense 
but it does have , about two thousand civil employees . 
and , on a scale , i guess it 's still considered small . 
it just have a lot of different laboratories . 
the area i work in , it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so . 
so that make up most of the laboratory 
so from that standpoint , it 's pretty small . 
what about yourself ? 
i work for actually probably similar kind of place . 
i see . 
so it 's very much the same kind of place the technical institution . 
i do n't know . 
what sorts of things would you consider important ? 
those and probably the security aspect of it . 
and it may not be true in every place . 
in a lot of cases i think you 're treated more like a number instead of a person . 
they just lay them off . 
i think the company still exists . 
what they use to do is , they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off . 
that way that one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time . 
unemployment is good 
but the company as a whole 
even the company is making money , 
they paying you a salary 
but you are responsible for that company growth . 
you 're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it 's at at making profits . 
so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than neglect or something like that . 
because it 's not a person 's fault that people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time . 
i do n't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but a number of people can be the downfall of a company situation . 
how do you mean that ? 
in a sense that how do you make a conclusion that you 're going to lay off these ten people . for the bad times of the company . 
what about the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well . 
in that standpoint . 
you think it 's better than to try to spread the effort equally among all the employees of the company 
i do . 
i really do . 
i think it 'd be better that way 
and even at that , it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that there are problems 
and there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time . 
that 's my views . 
i 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that . 
they went to a four and a half day work week rather than just cut everybody back ten percent . and have to , give everybody a half day a week off . 
and i think you can do that for a little while 
at least that would give a person a chance to look because the way it is , a person really do n't have a chance . 
how many children do you have now ? 
i have five . 
you have five ? 
you do have a hard time finding time then do n't you ? 
four of them are grown , 
they 're in college or just out of college 
you sound so young . 
i work at it . 
to have them 
i try to fool everybody . 
i think you 're doing a good job . 
i just have one child . 
there 's not much i can do about it . 
i think you are right 
because i was an only child too . 
and that 's one reason i have so many because i enjoy the big family . 
and so she is sort of like an only child 
and it 's the same type of thing , 
i have a younger brother like that . 
and i have a brother in his twenties . 
and i was the youngest . 
so i understand how that worked . 
and he was treated like he had five fathers or something . 
that 's exactly how it is . 
she 's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her . 
when things do n't go right , she just calls one of them . 
it 's a little bit difficult , though . 
did you all do a lot of organized things like little league soccer ? 
we really did not . 
and we did a lot of things together . 
we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform . 
and that was a lot of fun . 
but i guess you could consider that organized . 
there is a competition all the time . 
we were very heavy into that . 
and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that . 
i think that 's probably true . 
if you have one child or fewer , you get involved in organized events or activities 
and if you have a large number of children then you do n't . 
you ca n't afford to . 
and there 's not enough time 
my son is in little league this year . 
he 's ten . 
and they practice three times a week 
and they have a game 
if there were more than one child there would be no way to do it . 
that 's right . 
one parent go one direction 
and i 'd have to go in the other 
and we could only cover two at that . 
she had to go with me . 
so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing 
and , of course , the competing itself , really did n't matter what it was , 
it was making the friends and going all the places 
and it was a really neat experience , 
but it took our total time . 
i did not work when i did this . 
now i do work full-time . 
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other . 
i think three children is probably the ideal to me 
but i 'm not sure i could afford three . 
i most certainly could n't educate three . 
i do n't know how my parents did it . 
there were five of us 
and i do n't recall wanting anything in particular . 
but i do n't know how my father did it . 
he worked at a truck line 
and he just did n't make that kind of money with five children . 
but we did okay . 
but now , my wife and i both work 
and i do n't believe we have as much as my parents did 
and we only have one child . 
things cost a lot more . 
and i do n't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some . 
is it ? 
and from talking to them , they 're shocked . 
that 's what i 've heard . 
they sell their house , 
they stash away a good bit of money and come down here 
and i work with a lot of them , 
they think they have really done something . 
then when they get down here , they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to where they came from . 
the housing is cheaper , 
but that 's about it . 
i 'm surprised to hear that . 
i try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair . 
actually that is really a sore spot with me . 
i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving 
and not only that , but the repair capability of service departments and dealerships was equally dismal 
and it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea . 
so do you have a car ? 
do you have a car ? 
and it was n't as bad . 
and that is it . 
and it 's wonderful . 
and they 're good . 
they 're really good cars . 
every time i get taken to an auto repair place every time i go , i get taken . 
bad . 
woman goes in 
and they go we got a sucker . 
let 's see how much money we can get out of her . 
that 's what happens every time . 
what do you have ? 
and it just 
so . 
this just happened a couple of weeks ago . 
but just a few months ago when he was my husband his father gave us this car 
and everything is wrong with it . 
the power steering fluid leaks , 
the oil leaks , 
how old is the car ? 
and he just does n't take care of things 
but i was awarded the car 
and i can trust him . 
so he is trying to get things fixed on it . 
but i hate to go into a repair place because they 'll tell me something is wrong with it and it 's not and charge me twice as much . 
the last time i took it into a repair shop , the man told me i needed a master cylinder . 
so i said okay . 
and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars 
and then about a month later , a man was looking at my car 
not a repair man , but just a friend 
and i was telling him that i just 
and he said that 's not a new master cylinder 
and i did n't even know what one was . 
and he showed it to me 
and it was old , rusty , just awful . 
it was no more new than nothing . 
so apparently it was the same one that was on there . 
more than likely . 
and that was it . 
that was it , probably . 
i was so irritated . 
and that 's happened to me more than once or twice . just about every time i 've went in somewhere . 
so what 's the solution to that ? 
i guess find a reputable service , 
and you can hardly find one . 
the guy that 's doing most of my car now goes to my church 
and that 's the only reason i go to him because i know him 
and i know he will tell me the truth . 
because he does n't even charge me for doing it 
so he 's not going to take me . 
i just pay for the parts 
and he does it 
that 's wonderful . 
you 're lucky . 
i am , 
so , i do n't know . 
i do n't know what the solution to that is 
because the place where you buy your car , they 're usually the worst one of all . 
and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car . 
and so , idiots as we were , neither one of us knew much about cars , 
they told us we just had to have one 
and we bought one . 
we did n't no more need no new engine , 
give me break . 
so it was not good 
do you know anyone that is in a nursing home or has ever been in one ? 
but my grandparents were looking into it before 
so i know what they 've said . 
i 'm trying to think . 
and they were going to put her into a nursing home 
and when they put her in , she had all kinds of trouble 
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a nuisance . or worse than a nuisance , 
she sort of went bananas 
they thought it was too much of a bother . 
and they could n't deal with her . 
if they 're equipped to handle the kind of patients you 're going to have put in there too . 
because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still . 
they wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her 
but they wanted to be independent as well . have their own room . 
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it 
and then as she became less able to take care of herself , then she moved into this other part that was able to provide full-time care 
and she did n't have to do anything anymore . 
but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly . 
i do n't know whether that 's because they sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is . 
but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only six months or something . 
a lot of it 's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help . 
they need health care 
so they 're already ill before they go . 
that 's probably a large factor . 
if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you , then you stay where you are . 
then you only go there as a last resort . 
or people send you there as a last resort . 
it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . 
so that was their thinking . 
somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency . 
i guess that 's a problem too for people . wait lists and all . 
i guess . 
you ca n't always get in when you want too 
and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait . 
when you need it , you need it i guess . 
and the money is also another issue . how you 're going to pay for it . 
at that stage of life you only have so much money left 
and i guess it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings . 
it is kind of fair , 
but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise . 
so it 's another problem . 
and if it were you , you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price . 
so , it 's just so complicated anymore , i think . 
and , with medicine being the way it is , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down 
and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore . 
it 's just a shame that 's the way it has to be . 
i think the retirement home idea 's a nice idea . 
i 've known quite a few people that have gone to retirement communities . 
i do n't know if they have them back there 
i 've had three boys through some child care , each one of them 
and now they 're in school 
so it 's all over 
but i guess i would say it 's not easy to find what most parents would want . 
i can profit by this because i 'm due with my first in about three months . 
is that right . 
i guess the only rule i can think of is that i like to look for places with , uh , good respectable , nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that . 
if they 're associated with a college or a university , they 're usually a pretty good bet . 
i think it 's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something . 
i suppose you 're absolutely right there . 
but when my kids were young , i was teaching at a university 
and the child care center associated with our university was quite good 
so i felt confident that they 'd do right . 
do n't everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs ? for their pet theories or some such thing ? 
you mean learning type , 
actual experiments they would have to get your permission . 
but 
i suppose if there is a psychology department or an education department around , you might find that they 're pushing one form of education or another , 
i guess that 's true . 
but i never had bad experience in that respect . 
of course , you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents , 
and they , pretty good people . 
the thing i really worry about is the sexual abuse cases you read about . 
and you 'd just feel awful if something like that happened . 
i never really worry very much about it . 
i tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public 
so , i never really worried too much about that being , the case with my boys . 
i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them 
i do n't think it 's as common as the newspapers would make you believe . 
and another thing is cost . 
i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now 
in our case , we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were in school . 
and i 'm really happy we did it , although it was very , very difficult . 
and i think it was the right thing to do 
and we just decided that we would do it 
and we went ahead 
but not everybody can make that choice 
and even though my wife was n't working , we did have one or another of the boys in child care just for part of the day . or a couple of days a week just so that other things could get done around the house and so on , 
so , we did look around . 
so i would always trust her judgment on that . 
i 'm just thanking heaven . 
my husband just got a new job . 
his last company , he was only working four days a week . 
and he just got a new job . 
he 's getting lots of overtime , 
he got a pay raise 
and so i 'm just grateful that we do n't have to worry so much about my working or not . 
there 's absolutely no question that you 're going to be the best child care provider for that kid 
so 
do it as long . 
i suppose . 
but i think you have to look through a place 
and you have to get a feel for how they treat the kids and what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them . 
and the main thing is that you have to determine that they 're perfectly open . that you 're welcome anytime without notice , in the middle of the day and so forth 
you have to start wondering if they do n't want you . 
you have other friends that have kids being taken care of in child care ? 
i have one 
but i have n't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while . 
i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and pay and exhaustion and things like that , rather than these really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy . 
this is true . 
current affair can , get several shows . 
what do you think ? . 
i ca n't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago because i 'm not that old yet . 
i can be , 
but go ahead . 
obviously you look at the technological aspect of social change . 
you did n't have video games . 
you did n't have home computers . 
you go into a business today 
and , you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper 
we fax everything . 
we do n't even wait for the mail anymore . 
a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail 
and you had to do something , 
this was concerning the s e c , 
and so if they had business to do , they had to finish it three days in advance so they could get it through the mail . 
and now it 's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute . because you can get it there in a matter of minutes through a fax machine 
because you 're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute . 
and i recently read an article on just this , that said stress today is so much worse . 
it should be less because we have a microwave 
and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes 
and we have no down time . 
we do n't stop and wait for things to happen because we do n't have to . 
so we keep moving . 
we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing . 
so we have no relaxation time in between 
so they say that 's really a bad thing . that you need to learn a lot of ways to deal with that and get your time in between things . 
so that 's good . 
that 's an interesting point . 
but i just think our family lives have changed drastically . 
of course a part of it is technology . 
some of that is really bad i think . 
but , we have all single families . 
so many single families now . 
both parents are working . 
so there 's a whole big effect on our kids 
and not very many of my daughter 's friends really are on their original mother and father . 
i 'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years . 
there 's that 
and there 's the fact that nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen . 
you 're probably right . 
and that 's never really occurred to me 
but that 's interesting . 
i never really thought about it that way . 
i saw the numbers on that awhile back 
that 's true . 
when is this good or not good . 
we do n't know that yet . 
an , extremely large part of the next generation is going to be , second generation from immigrant parents . 
i do n't know either . 
that 's true . 
and they 're going to be really struggling 
it 's no longer the accomplishment that it once was 
and not that many people are really trying i do n't think . 
that 's kind of scary . 
. that 's true . 
it 's just very , very different 
and i guess every ten years it 's just been very different . 
. and i do n't know what 's going to happen . 
i know what i 'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they 're establishing careers 
and they 've got their homes 
why do n't you go ahead and start . 
i think the court systems could stand some improvement . 
trial by jury is good 
i do n't know . 
i think so . 
and that 's the sort of system they have . 
they 're like lawyers i guess . 
they 're experts in the law 
and there really is n't a jury 
and they do the questioning also . 
the judges do the questioning 
but i 'm not sure i like that . 
i think i prefer the jury system myself . 
you think you prefer the jury ? 
you think your chances are better ? 
actually i think in most criminal cases it would n't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury . 
what i worry about is cases where it 's the government against the individual . 
that 's where you really need a jury of peers . 
because anytime the government is the government against the individual you need the protection of ordinary citizens . 
that 's true . 
i think that 's really the only thing . 
i guess i do n't think that juries need to decide sentencing all the time . 
i think maybe a judge is a better judge of that 
sometimes the sentencing is not fair . 
the jury , i guess they do decide that 
but , i 'm like you , 
i do n't know , 
maybe i 'm too , conservative when it comes to that . 
the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases , 
if you drag twelve people into a courtroom , i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone 's guilty or innocent . 
that 's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe . 
but people who do n't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are , to ask them to decide for one case , on one person , based on what they see , i think that is maybe a little bit naive . 
it 's kind of a hanging jury atmosphere . 
but in a lot of places , i think people bend over the other way , 
but i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it . 
some cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . 
i kind of like that system . 
that 's not a bad system . 
but i do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit . 
and lawyers blow sand in their eyes . 
i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries . 
insurance cases and things like that . 
and there would be more honest settlements instead of this tugging of people 's heart strings and making them cry and feel like they 're doing somebody good by giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering . 
putting on a act or whatever . 
so . i think , in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government 
have you had that experience recently ? 
recently , 
i ca n't really say recently . 
i believe it was one of these , mixers . these juice machines 
and i do n't think it was my fault because i had made a point of drying it off and cleaning it 
what about you ? 
i do n't have so much trouble with products as service . 
i do n't feel like that 's as big a problem . 
i 've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because i 've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly . 
and i 'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent . 
the one i have now is okay , most of the time . 
but that 's it . 
but that 's probably the worst . 
i do n't know if you have that up there 
but it 's a very good company . that sells sterling silver things 
and the catch broke 
and she was sitting in school on a carpet 
and when she stood up , it caught and broke 
and we took it back 
and they said this was just obviously yanked . 
this was yanked . 
they were so rude about it . 
and so we wanted a different kind of catch 
and she said it 's not guaranteed . 
and i said , put it on because apparently nothing 's guaranteed 
so do it anyway . 
so we got the kind we wanted 
and i was really disappointed with that . 
i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable 
and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends 
and i called there to see if they had it 
and the lady was very nice . 
and i said my goodness , 
i said you 've been very nice , 
what 's your name . 
and she told me 
and i said i really appreciate it . 
i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that , store 
and it turned out she was the assistant manager 
at least you 're talking to somebody who counts . 
so i felt kind of good about that . 
i did n't even know the person 's name that had given me the hard time or anything 
but i just felt like , at least i did something . 
maybe they 'll fix it . 
they might work on that . 
but i find attitudes are more of a problem . 
service is more of a problem . 
up here in the northeast we have these mail order companies like l l bean 
they 'll actually do things like this . 
they bend over backwards service wise for you . 
i 've found also a lot of companies nowadays , they have eight hundred numbers you can call . 
that 's really great . 
i guess you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance , and you can get the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies . 
and actually i 've tried that with a few companies lately . 
and most of them have been pretty good , 
the customer is always right 
and no matter how crabby you might be over the phone , they are very understanding 
and they make sure things are set properly if you 're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise . 
that 's really good . 
it use to be like that . 
i do n't think most places are like that anymore . 
things are getting rough out there , 
the morale among employees tends to go down 
and we kept that going for about a month 
and it became so onerous that we gave up on it . 
that sounds about right . 
so the only thing that we do now is i keep a little spread sheet of what i call the net worth calculation which is just the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth . 
and i only update that maybe once every quarter or so . every three months . just , basically when the statements come in just to see whether or not we 're getting ahead , falling behind or staying even or what . 
that 's really about the extent of the kind of financial score keeping that we 're doing . 
it 's kind of difficult for me . because right now like most teachers , i 'm laid off 
that 's terrible . 
i substitute a lot . 
but i know how much i have to bring in a month . 
and that 's about it . 
that 's about as far as we go . 
i see . 
are you married ? 
i 'm a single mother . 
i have three children . 
i see , 
so right now , we get aid from the state at this point because there 's no other way to do it . 
so right now i know what i 'm getting from the state 
and i have to balance , more or less , what i get from the state with my bills and try to work as many days as possible . any time they call me in . 
if i work too many days , then i lose all my state aid 
and if i do n't work enough days then i do n't get enough to meet the bills 
and it 's like a juggling act every single month . 
this week i 've been just holding my breath and hoping they 'll call me in 
but they probably wo n't because next week the kids have school vacation . 
i see . 
so the four days before , they only have a four day week 
i see . 
they do n't like to be absent before a vacation . 
because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me . 
his company went bankrupt . 
it was a computer subsidiary . 
i do n't know what a shoe company 's doing running a computer company . 
they took the top management and gave them jobs at the corporate front office 
and everybody else was sent packing . 
hang on one second 
somebody was knocking on my door here . 
it sounds terrible to say , 
but at the present stage , you probably are even more in the market for a budgetary thing than most people probably might be . in terms of keeping score of input and output . 
do you have a computer at home 
we do . 
i keep track of every penny . and , more or less , enter it in . 
every single day i 'm at the computer . 
i see . 
and , it 's what do we have left , what do we have to pay , what have we paid this month . what has n't come in yet . 
do you use a standard spread sheet 
i 'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as i have been . 
let 's put it this way . 
they 've had some serious problems in the past couple of years . 
why ? 
partly due to ownership . 
and he always had this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something 
and they 've had some financial problems with the team and so forth . 
and it recently was sold to some other people 
i 've been to a few games before . 
so you 've got two football teams down there . 
so we have one football team as far as we 're concerned . 
i see . 
that 's how it is . 
there 's that type of segregation ? 
it 's divided , 
it really is , 
so we 've got our cowboys here 
and , i do n't think anybody roots differently 
do you , 
and he is for the raiders . l a raiders , 
do you follow professional sports at all ? 
i just started to this year because of these silly raiders that did n't do very well , 
but i 've been trying more this year . 
i think i know a little more than i use to . 
i never knew very much at all 
so i 'm trying . 
it 's a good past time . 
particularly football . 
and they get together with a bunch of guys 
and they have a good time and everything 
so i should n't even try to do it ? 
it 's good in terms of a contest . 
it has the speed . 
and the hand eye coordination 
we might . 
do we ? 
you probably know , 
i do n't know . 
nobody talks about it 
so i do n't think we do . 
and we have a soccer team that comes and goes . 
we do n't even have that very much , 
i think though that professional football in particular , is becoming so diluted now . 
they have this world football league . 
you see , 
there are those teams that play in , national football league 
but now they have what 's called the world football league 
and there 's teams in the united states 
and they 're playing now during the summer months 
and there 's only so much football you can watch . 
i do n't like to watch . 
that 's good . 
i do n't like to watch anything . 
i think it 's an , excuse to do nothing 
and i can see what you 're saying about the male bonding 
and the guys get together 
and that 's kind of cool . 
that 's fun . 
have you ever been to a professional football game ? 
i have . 
have you ? 
i have . 
actually . 
that 's what you got to do . 
i 've done that for college football . 
the same thing . 
there 's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games . 
and we talked our wives into going with us one time 
and they had a real good time 
and it was , basically , for the social atmosphere . 
and that 's the thing . 
you go three or four hours before the game . 
you go set up . 
we set a table up , 
it 's not so much the contest itself and the game itself , 
but it 's the whole atmosphere of going to a game . 
that you miss sitting home in your parlor with a six pack of beer and some potato chips 
that 's right . 
you miss that . 
that 's right . 
and any professional sport i think , you miss that . 
the atmosphere of being there . 
in high school i went to every football game 
i still do n't know that much about football , obviously . 
but i still had a good time , 
the question was talking about the juries 
maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again . 
so that a judge would be the most appropriate person to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . 
i kind of agree with that , because i think in some cases the jury may not even have , the information about other crimes the person has committed . 
and if they 're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate sentencing . 
i agree with you . 
one thing i heard was this , where instead of going to the regular court , they have a mock court . 
it 's supposed to be all legal and everything . 
you go 
and you present your case , 
the other side presents their case 
and you 're done with it . 
it did n't backlog all of the cases that are all ready pending . 
that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way . 
there would be some types of crimes for which you 're not guaranteed a jury trial ? 
there 's a point on which we do n't agree . 
i would tend , myself , to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime one of the parties wants one . 
and usually it is the defendant that wants to have the jury hear the case . 
that would require a change in the bill of rights , i believe 
and i did n't mean that . 
i did n't mean that , 
i would feel that my civil rights had been violated . 
but i meant for some , when both parties agreed that we 're going to have a judge here . 
we 're not going to have a jury , 
let 's get it over with . 
sort of car accidents , 
i think that 's all ready possible . 
i think , that you can waive the right to a , jury trial 
so . i agree that that should be encouraged . 
people should know that that 's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial . 
giving a different sentence . 
the take . 
i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though , rather than civil . 
is that right ? 
in the case of , civil things maybe the use of the jury is very , often to the lawyer 's advantage 
there are cases where they could be settled , maybe out of court a little more efficiently . 
it 's to their advantage to play to as big an audience , as possible 
so . i was wondering too , if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in a criminal cases . 
i 'm not so sure i 'm in favor of that . 
but i am in favor of it for criminal cases 
so there 's a difference of my view there for those two . 
you can tell i have n't been in too many judges chambers or anything like that . 
have you ever had to serve jury duty ? 
but i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me 
they let me out . 
and that was almost twenty years ago . 
sort of amazed me 
that would have been about twenty years too 
just last year 
and the case i heard was a criminal case 
and it seemed really , trivial . 
it involved two bicycles . 
we did n't do the sentencing . 
the judge did . 
how interesting . 
we rendered a verdict 
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing . 
actually , i 've been involved in electronics a long time . in computers 
and i have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home . up until maybe about a year and a half ago , 
it 's a real easy to use color computer 
and i got a very nice printer that goes along with it 
and he uses it for his school work . 
i 'm currently in school 
and i 've found that i pretty much become addicted to it 
it 's very essential for me . 
schools have them , 
but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school . 
it 's much more convenient to have one at home . 
where you going to school ? 
i see . 
in engineering ? 
i have some games , of course , which i play on there 
and i have a program which allows me to access a weather data bank 
so i can check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby . 
so , it provides other means other than just strict computations and so on , 
so . do you have a computer for yourself at home ? 
i just have one for my son 
and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing . 
and i , in the past , have done a great deal of , system development just through software development programming . 
but now i find myself using the computer , 
even the computer at work is primarily a word processing system and a communication system . 
but 
so it 's really become my mainstay i guess . 
i ca n't even remember , 
and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high , 
i did my master 's thesis on a typewriter . 
and it was a pretty big deal . 
it must have been tough . 
it 's a little bit strange for me . 
i did my master 's thesis last year 
and i did that on a computer 
i just ca n't imagine how people did it before . 
it must have been just so much work . 
it was just a completely different world then . 
do you like that kind of computer ? 
i like it , 
i like it from a distance really . 
i see the packages on it that are available 
and it 's nice . 
i really do n't use it myself . 
when i come home from work , i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things . 
so i let my son do it 
it 's sort of a joke 
but it 's really true , 
and the kids , they just take to it like candy . 
not very good 
it 's not been a good day . 
i turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon . 
i do n't know . 
so i hope she 's turned it in . 
are you eating ? 
go ahead , 
i 'll stop eating . 
i just barely got home from the university . 
say what ? 
i just barely got home from the university . 
tell you what we can do is i can punch the one , 
and then after five minutes when the voice comes on , we can talk all night if we want . 
go ahead , 
fire away . 
but i 'm afraid i 'm probably in the minority . 
i agree with you . 
i guess i do have a bone to pick with the way taxes are distributed . 
and the sales tax ca n't . 
i think that 's regressive 
and it 's kind of dumb . 
i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax . 
but , on the other hand , i do n't mind that it 's only on things that are n't like groceries and that , 
it 's not on that . 
nobody taxes groceries . 
they do . 
where ? 
is that right ? 
but we have a pretty low tax rate here . 
i think the sales tax , they just got to do something about it . 
if you compute as a percentage of total income , all taxes lumped together , we actually do pretty well . 
there 's no other country that is taxed as low as we are . 
i 'm not sure i understand what you mean . 
and i 'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have , then have to live there . 
you mean , lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes . 
higher taxes . 
i suppose that 's true , 
probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever 
still 's that way to some extent . 
i think the other problem is it 's easy to complain about taxes because there 's something you , theoretically , can do something about . 
and you 're not quite in the same situation 
but school taxes for me . 
i wish i did n't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year than i had to pay for all of my school taxes . 
that 's probably a little tougher on you . 
that 's a decision , 
i guess that 's all right . 
when i was single and again when i 'm retired , i will not mind paying what it takes to keep the schools good . 
that 's always been a high priority . 
i think that 's just you though . 
i do , 
that 's true . 
and , there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they ca n't get anything done . 
that seems like a cultural lapse . 
people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools . 
people would rather increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them . 
but i think it 's sad selfish and shortsighted . 
or build roads . 
actually i 'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have working for a large corporation . 
and , for me , there 's absolutely no question what 's the most important benefit 
i think it 's health care . 
i think everybody would say that . 
and if you try to get it outside of your corporation , you 're going to pay an arm and a leg . 
sometimes i think it 's more important than salary . 
do you also get dental ? 
and i do n't know if i would rank that second 
but since i have three boys it can turn out to be important . 
you know 
i know . 
in a given year , dental expenses can really kill you . 
and he gets the full health and dental 
and we have four children 
and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous . 
and i do n't know how people that do n't have it can afford it . 
or maybe they do n't . 
that 's right . 
that 's right . 
i guess that would be up there . 
i 'm not sure how i would rank that compared to retirement 
or pretax savings was another thing that i think is a great benefit . 
it 's a lot easier to save it when you do n't get your hands on it first . 
when you have the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has , you can offer some incentive 
what about , lesser benefits perhaps for you but for the women in the corporation . 
leave ? 
do they have father leaves or anything like that ? 
i do n't think so yet . 
they may have just plain parental leave , which either one can take . 
i do too . 
i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks . 
she is n't recovered . 
and the infant needs her desperately , at that point and time . 
there ought to be some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position in exchange for a longer period of time . 
i agree . 
it 's so important to families then 
and yet anybody who 's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up . 
especially in this day and age . 
you do n't want to start over again anywhere . 
you 're right . 
i think you 've put your finger on the one benefit that i would most like to see changed . the parental leave . 
i think they 've come a long way . 
at least some companies . 
and as manager they have a very , very poor leave policy 
and i just do n't know how women do it . 
particularly , single parents who do n't have the support at the other end . 
there 's no other way unless they 're part of some extended family which is unlikely . 
that 's right . 
that 's exactly right . 
and it 's just a terrible choice , 
you should n't have to make it . 
you 're right . 
one of the benefits we get , of course , is travel . 
would i like to have that . 
it 's wonderful . 
the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere 
but you ca n't afford to stay once you get there . 
listen 
i have friends in a lot of different cities . 
if you just fly me there , i 'll take care of that . 
that 's right . 
you have to have an awful lot of fun 
just getting there , has to be half the fun . 
taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society . 
but really , people get upset at taxes because it 's more efficient to do things yourself . 
and so as a result it 's a trade-off for the common good for the benefit of others . 
have you ever thought just how much of that money should go to other people that really do n't deserve it ? 
i know it 's a lot that i feel just like you said , that , there 's just so much that you can do yourself . that you take care of your own self that you do n't need the money for 
but they 're giving it to other people that do n't really need it either , 
but yet they accept it . 
the thing of it is , if i wanted to just permanently become a book reader , i guess i could just go on public assistance look for people to take care of me . 
like so many people do . 
and probably a good woman , 
just con somebody to take care of me . 
and then you do n't have to be on the tax roll . 
but taxes are very difficult kind of thing 
and everybody really hates it . 
it was very timely . 
i always over pay my deductions 
so i wind up getting money back from my , withholding . 
that 's always a smile . 
but , of course i 've paid it in 
and i should calculate it better . 
you are you in business for yourself ? 
i work for the f b i . 
so i 'm a federal employee . 
guess i do n't sound like it ? 
i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else . 
unless you work for internal revenue . 
i 've got all four feet in the trough being a federal employee . 
but i can understand who gets benefits . 
every time there is a bond issue i vote no on every one of them . 
but , this is , not tax revolt country . 
so it 's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to get into a tax revolt situation . 
and so as people get older and older they think about retirement and that sort of thing 
and they 're building old people 's homes at tax expense . 
i think the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it 's cheaper . 
that 's right . 
instead , it 's the taxes here 
but there 's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer . 
and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer . 
that 's a strategy that the people have to take . is how to be able to lessen their cost of living 
i 'm five or six years before i 'm eligible to retire 
and i 'm saying i really ca n't stay here as a retiree . 
after you retire , 
it 's too expensive . 
i 'm going to have . 
my parents are in the same situation . 
their home is paid for 
but still their taxes are so high , that my father does n't feel like he can retire because they could n't pay their taxes . 
and they have no children in school or anything now . 
they do n't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards . 
and they 're not doing it again , . 
you must be what ? 
i 'm not . 
who do you work for ? 
i do n't work . 
i 'm a student . 
i go to school . 
i 'm in nursing school . 
i do n't know what you drive now . 
what do you drive now ? 
throw them in the back . 
they sort of fit our requirement . 
cab . 
and so they just fit in there . 
when they get to be teenagers with long legs , it may not work . 
right now , i can throw them all in the back when we have room 
and since i do a lot of projects , i throw things in the back 
there you go . 
and i kind of like having a pickup truck . 
actually , i think of it , as a car that 'll last . 
i know . 
i like the way trucks are built 
and i do n't care about comfort . 
so , i 'm pretty happy . 
i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too , 
so i got a four runner . 
so i would n't hesitate to get another one . 
i never buy new 
so i would n't hesitate to get another used truck . 
you 're just like me . 
i 've never bought a new vehicle in my life . 
and 
i do n't need to pay for the glitz . 
i 'll let somebody else have the showroom shine 
and i 'll pay for the rest of it . 
let somebody else break it in , 
we might go again on a van . 
we could probably do with something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time . 
i 'm not sure . 
we 'll have to face it in a couple of years 
and we were real happy with that because my second requirement after price is low maintenance . 
and it certainly had that . 
we did n't do much to it at all . 
pretty much the same . 
and it pretty much does everything i need it to . 
it 'll tow three thousand pounds 
so i can tow everything 
and it 's real reliable , 
i 've had it for almost four years now 
and up until two weeks ago , it had never had anything wrong with it . 
i do n't know , 
did n't do any damage to it . 
i caught it real early . 
at how many miles ? 
so it 's not real early . 
never overheated it . 
went out and looked . 
saw where it was coming from . 
drove it right to the shop and left it off . 
and that was it 
that 's sort of my , hobby though more than a vehicle . 
i do n't know , 
he 's pretty conservative guy . 
i do n't think it 's much of a sport for him . 
i know 
but i bet you he really enjoys riding it . 
i 'm sure he does , 
when was the last time you took your truck out just to go driving ? 
and i go out twice a week on the bike , . at least . just for the enjoyment . 
but 
the only thing i think i might get , a new car or , not necessarily a new car but , another car , 
i would consider going to a normal pickup rather than a covered pickup like the one i 've got . just because there 's a lot of times i wished i had , just an open bed to throw stuff in . 
you got one . 
that 's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back 
i really leave it on there just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty . 
to have it out of the way . 
but they 're solid . 
i think they last a lot longer than anything else . 
i kind of like mine , 
it 's a really nice truck . 
i heard about that , 
it 's beautiful . 
that thing will last forever , 
that 's a serious truck . 
it 's got a boat engine in it . 
i know a contractor who just got one of those . 
he 's pleased with it . 
think about this ? 
do you have children in school ? 
i do . 
i have two that are now just about ready to graduate from college 
but i also have two that are just entering school . 
i think they 're just pushing them entirely to fast . 
so you see a big difference then in before and now do you 
a lot of testing ? 
i do too , 
i think that 's awful . 
and i thought how mature do you have to be . 
i know . 
what 's the new criteria . 
do you have the standardized testing now ? 
we have all kinds of testing 
and it 's over and over . 
and they test , test , test . 
but it 's a very transient community . 
a lot of people from everywhere , 
and most of them from other places . 
and we just , have lots of people from everywhere . lots of industry coming in , 
and it 's a very wealthy community . 
not that i am 
but other people seem , to be 
and i would love to know why 
but they do . 
you would like to know what they 're doing . 
i would , 
i really would . 
they just have beautiful , beautiful homes 
and they have everything . 
the kids only wear name brand things to school 
and it 's one of these things , 
that makes it hard for you , does n't it . 
it does . 
and it does . 
we do it to a point 
but not to where she feels different , 
but some of them are very rich 
it 's hard to explain to them why you ca n't . 
and so we just kind of have , everything here 
and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are . 
but the kids are expected to excel in , everything . 
and it 's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody ca n't be first 
and they 're expected to be . 
their parents expect it , 
the teachers expect it , 
and if you read national surveys , they 're far from it . 
and so there 's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests . 
how about the kids . 
how are they coping with it ? 
not very well . 
they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night 's sleep and eat right in the morning before , tests . 
they make a big deal . 
to me , the paper should just be put on the desk that day 
and say just do this . 
i just feel they do better that way . 
rather than anticipating . 
and i have older children too that now are out of high school 
and they 've always done this here . 
it 's always been the same 
but it 's getting worse and worse , 
is more pressure for everything . 
and i just think it 's really awful 
and i 'm with you on that . 
you do n't hear too many people say this , 
but i think it 's a very long day . 
it is . 
and my feeling is that you 're only a kid once , and you do n't want to spend your whole life in school . 
that 's right . 
my son came home 
and he said mom , all we do is work . 
we hardly ever play 
and i do n't think that 's right . 
likewise . 
i do n't think i should have to pay for dancing lessons , gymnastics , piano . 
would n't that be great . 
and so i just find this a real problem . 
i think if they 're going to be there all day , they should find time . 
and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week 
and when she went back in six weeks , she was ahead . 
so what does that tell you ? 
is that right ? 
it tells you there 's a whole lot of wasted time . 
and they could be using this time better . 
and i think either send them home or do something a little more interesting . 
i agree . 
but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this . 
i would n't be surprised . 
i doubt if they would say it was too long . 
that 's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day . 
do you have the before school care , at your school and the after school care ? 
that 's as far back as i can remember . 
that 's before my time actually . 
and we found that it was a very liberal kind of community . 
but i really feel that the law enforcement community puts these people behind bars 
and then these lawyer groups get together 
and i think that there 's something that has to be changed in the system to do that . 
i think capital punishment was probably stringent enough 
but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way . 
i think that currently the way the law stands , 
it 's more they 're not enforcing the death penalty itself . 
it 's at that point where they 're saying here you 're going on death row 
but you 'll stay there for twenty years . 
and nothing is being done about it . 
and it 's really getting out of hand in many states . 
i 'm , at this juncture 
i 'm not sure what constitutes a technicality . 
that 's what all these hearings are about 
and that 's what all these court cases are about . 
and he tried to appeal his conviction . 
and it did n't work . 
but be that as it may , everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry . 
or you became a ward of somebody 
and you were his slave . 
and if he did n't like what you did , he killed you . 
and that 's pretty effective . 
it 's not good for civil rights , i guess , 
but it 's pretty effective in that you 've got to get along in the community 
as man has gotten more complicated so to protect him from being dumped on by civilian authority in criminal actions , especially murder cases and that sort of thing . 
it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished , 
and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually did n't , albeit it seems that we are failing in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off . 
and i know the government gives drug tests to all new applicants coming into government . 
and i quite frankly , do n't see anything wrong with it . 
and i feel that if you 're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that 's difficult unless you really go into a deep background . 
being involved in my organization we have deep background checks 
but , sometimes drug use can escape that . 
of course , if he 's fallen in love with drugs and there is n't anything but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful , then maybe there is no hope . 
what 's your feeling ? 
i guess i 'm probably a little more toward the other direction . 
there 's two sides to it i guess . 
one is that if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , even if it 's smoking then i think that , i do n't have any problem at all with testing that individual on the spot . 
but i guess i feel more like whatever you 're doing in your own private life is your own private business . 
and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that things like drug laws seem to come and go . 
we had prohibition for awhile 
and then we did n't have prohibition . 
maybe a little longer . 
who knows . 
prohibition certainly did n't last . 
i think there 's so much criminal activity that people go into to support drug habits . 
but you got to look at prohibition though . 
you had the same problems there ? 
they support drug habits with things like burglary or prostitution or stuff like that , 
it goes back to that , again , if you look at prohibition . 
because it 's illegal , it costs more . 
face it 
you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for ten or twenty dollars an ounce . 
i must admit that , 
and you 'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it . 
but 
that 's why there 's people dealing it because there 's money in it . 
there 's ridiculous amounts of money . 
and then another one will jump up . 
there 's no way you 're ever going to win that . 
the tighter you squeeze , the more the price goes up , the more incentive there is . 
that 's a losing fight . 
if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand 
but people want to , get stoned 
it goes back to what can society impose on people . 
can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen ? 
i do n't think you can . 
everybody ought to do their own share , . 
i do n't have any love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they 're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff . 
i guess it 's an easy one for me . 
i think there 's something seriously wrong , 
what is it that you are particularly upset about ? 
and i 'm not sure they know exactly what public education supposed to be for anymore . 
but i voted with my feet 
and my kids go to parochial school . 
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they would n't get in the public school system ? 
one hundred percent of the customers care . 
that 's one thing . 
everybody cares about the education the kids are getting . 
and they take an relatively active part . 
if you 're sending two thousand dollars that way every year , you watch what goes on 
and you pay attention and participate 
and you can influence the way things are . 
so you 're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of real estate or other taxes 
and , consequently , they 're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they 'd like to see them happen ? 
the immediacy just is n't there . 
and , actually , i think this is a cultural problem . 
the problem with public education is really a problem with the culture . 
and you ca n't get a tax levy passed . 
i think that 's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it was n't our kids . 
i think that 's the principal problem is that people no longer see it as their problem 
and there 's an immediate problem . 
it troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good 
and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes having an educated populace and then idea that you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes at the local level or bigger votes at the national level . 
it means that you 've got to be informed 
and you 've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision . 
i believe that the original idea of public education in the united states , which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution . it barely made it . 
i think it was added afterwards . 
i think the principal was education for civic participation . 
the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter 
and you could n't pull the wool over their eyes . 
it has taken on a more profound , economic thrust . 
that 's exactly what i was going to say . 
now there seem to be really three reasons for education . 
one is education for civic duty . 
one is education for economic reasons . 
and one is education for civilization . 
i 'm glad that you added that one . 
i think that one 's significant . 
that 's what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor 
but the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is an economic enterprise to train people for jobs . 
and i 'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is . 
and i 'm really sad to say this , 
i never thought i would have 
but i really think that the educational establishment has become part of the problem . 
and that 's why i 'm sort of , reluctantly in favor of these choice programs . 
i agree with everything that you 've said so far 
and the sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing 
and they are the three things that you mentioned . 
kids too ? 
. . 
you laugh . 
how many , 
what ages ? . 
and we had five . 
you 've been through the fun part . 
and how about yourself ? 
i have a four and a half and a three . 
i 'm sure there 's a lot of differences in the way it 's done now and then . 
when mine were growing up , i did some traveling but not that extensively 
but i always just made it a point to spend about ten minutes with each one of them . 
so it was an hour . 
but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever , telling them stories or reading to them . 
what was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest ? 
six years . 
so they were all real close ? 
that 's tough . 
that 's a lot of time . 
we look back and wonder how we did it . 
did you both work ? your wife too ? 
she never did . 
qualify that . 
she worked at home , i 'm sure . 
both my husband and i work 
and sometimes i feel like by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed , i have very little time each evening . 
that 's plenty though . 
and he spends a lot of time with them while i 'm cooking 
and then i spend time with them while he 's doing other stuff . 
and , of course , we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend . 
there 's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it 
but it 's neat , 
it 's straight 
and i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids . 
with kids you 're not going to have a neat house . 
i 've accepted that too . 
and it 's tough to find time . especially with both of them working . 
that 's true . 
it is . 
that 's true . 
and you just have to set the time and say , this is going to be it . 
that 's true 
and we do a lot of that on the weekends . 
things like that where they 're not really missing the presence . 
and we do a lot of family things together . 
we 're kind of going the other direction this weekend . 
we 're planning a trip , just he and i . 
this is the first time we 've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago . 
that 's good too . 
that 's good that way too . 
i decided that you need that once in awhile . that , you need to plan the quality time 
they say all it takes is about five , ten minutes a day . 
and as the kids got older i made them help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too . or whatever 
and they think that 's a family activity . 
that 's great fun . 
and 
of course , you can . 
just keep them talking that way . 
and what would you do , 
what ? 
discuss everything that did n't agree with them . 
and we 'd take turns being president . 
and everyone would get one vote . 
but it never worked that way . 
so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week 
and we could bring up stuff too . 
and then , 
and that was always good time . 
we really got to know the kids well . 
i imagine . 
and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them . 
that 's wonderful . 
i was raised in that type of family where you do n't disobey me , you mind me 
but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it , you can always come back and talk to me about it . 
we did too . 
we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree 
and she said , i do n't make , fun of your friends 
so why make fun of mine ? 
kind of hit us between the eyes . 
you do n't think of it that way do you . 
but that was always good quality time for us . 
that 's good . 
i like that idea . 
and then never attend , 
but if they missed it , they had to abide by the rules . 
whatever was voted on . 
and they 'd show up . 
i think that 's great . 
and we 'd usually take notes 
and the younger kids or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another . 
but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us . 
and they loved it . 
i think that 's true . 
i can remember times my parents would say what do you think would be a fair punishment . 
and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done . 
so i do think it 's right that they 're harder on themselves . 
but i feel for you and your husband . 
why is that ? 
how you doing ? 
pretty good . 
i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it . 
i 'm ready whenever you are . 
what are your thoughts on the subject there ? 
i definitely think decisions have to be unanimous . 
i think that 's probably a good thing . 
it 's probably the safest thing . 
and simple majority wo n't do . 
definitely 
but i do n't know . 
i could n't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing . 
gives them a little too much power . 
i know of a couple of people who would be arguing with that . or arguing against that pretty vehemently . 
plus you may be doing a guilty verdict 
but it may be for technical reasons . 
about the only good thing i would say about that is that it would , hurry the process up a bit 
but even now i know we 've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that 
if the judge was doing it himself , without any checks and balances who 's to say . 
there would be much more of that . 
no doubt . 
are you involved in the legal system at all ? 
but i tend to follow it just to know what 's going on . 
i 've got some friends that are lawyers 
i do too 
one of them just got his law degree . 
but to tell you the truth , i 'm not real familiar with the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now . 
i really have n't studied it in depth . 
it 's more in how you present it versus who 's right . 
i 'm sure of it . 
because a lot of those things , it 's largely a matter of viewpoint . and who can argue their case better . 
it 's kind of weird . 
i do n't know , 
i always think about watching the people 's court or something . and how weird those cases get . 
i know . 
when i was , a couple of years ago , involved in some pretrial stuff 
it 's pretty amazing . 
and it 's like the truth is n't really important anymore . 
this friend of mine 's pretty obnoxious 
and he really gets into suing people . 
and so he 'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court , and argue his case , 
it 's wasting people 's time and the taxpayers ' money and everything else . 
that sounds like a little abuse of our system 
people do n't want to take responsibility . 
and most of the time they 're looking to place blame . and stuff . 
is that right ? 
i was just thinking 
and the rest of the country is not or something like that . 
pretty strange . 
but that friend of mine 's telling me that i might have to go in as a witness . 
he may subpoena me . 
so we 'll see what happens . 
i 'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better . 
there are too many big problems . 
there 's such a backlog of court cases right now . 
i know . 
and we already have too many lawyers as it is . 
and if it 's criminal cases you ca n't put them in jail because there 's no room left . 
that 's true . 
and , in fact , they 're even letting some go . 
and it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they do n't have room for them . 
that 's not a good solution either . 
not at all . 
do you have any special interest in space flight ? 
i suspect a lot of people got turned on by watching those go off . 
very exciting . 
i 've always , wanted very much to be somehow involved in all that . and to meet and to see it actually happen . 
of course , i 've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday . 
but that seems rather unlikely at this point , unfortunately . 
what do you do now ? 
computer programmer . 
unfortunately , that can be done from the ground . 
to bad . 
made the wrong career choice to get up into space . 
i used to think when i was younger that by this time we 'd have lots more stuff in space than we do now . 
frustrating at times . 
i do n't know what you think about all that . 
i 'm kind of young . 
there 's a lot that 's happened in my lifetime as far as with the space shuttle and all . although plans to go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to the sixties . 
it would be great if we could find some way to , use that to boost the economy . 
i 've always felt that one of the long-term solutions would be to have some sort of solar power satellites up . 
and you can just get as much power as you need up there . 
it 's just a matter of how big you build it . 
so you 're talking about positive side effects then . 
i understand . 
that makes a lot of sense . 
the only problem is , of course , that that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there . 
and they want to do the research 
we should do it for the return we get for it . 
and unfortunately , that 's not what i thinks happened . 
the downside of that is after you do one of those , people say we did it . 
now we 're done . 
now we 're done . 
no need to play around with this space stuff anymore . 
but i 'd give almost anything to get into space . 
i think you 're right . 
i would too . 
what do you think about capital punishment ? 
i 'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes . 
which crimes do you feel that ? 
i think first degree murder probably warrants it . 
i originally come from the state that has , the death penalty . 
and they 're pretty liberal on it . 
go ahead . 
go ahead . 
so they 're pretty hip on it too , i guess . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't think that 's right . 
but on the other hand , there 's a lot of advantages to it . 
i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it 
and , of course , you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not . 
that 's what 's happening here . 
in fact , a big gubernatorial issue is the turnover rates of repeat offenders being let out and doing it again . 
and it 's like that 's a big problem 
but there 's not a whole lot you can do about it because there 's only so many jails you can build 
and it gets to be a big problem . 
go ahead . 
i wish if they were going to do it , they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who does n't . 
because a lot of these guys they get in 
and they get off for good behavior 
and , i do n't know , 
just because , like we said before , they do n't have enough room in the jails there 's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early . 
i do n't know , 
i think that may solve a lot of that . 
maybe not solve it , 
but , i do n't know , 
kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty . 
what program you in ? 
what do you do ? 
but i do n't know . 
it 's an interesting issue . 
i ca n't give you figures 
is that right ? 
i 've heard things about that . 
i 've heard that they do n't mess around very much . 
they do n't get repealed as easily as they do . 
and then they said , 
you do n't have to go . 
and then they took him back . 
it just seemed a little inconsistent . 
and then you have two , 
you have these people who are serial killers that did n't even get the death sentence back when ever . 
i do n't know . 
i 'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it . 
or is it a life sentence ? 
the military does n't execute anymore 
or death before the firing squad or whatever . 
so , i think about the only one is rape , 
how do you feel about it ? 
i do n't see any problem with testing for random drugs . 
i , myself , almost am in favor of it . 
and i went through a , standard drug testing thing before i was brought on . 
i think that 's pretty standard . 
i think it 's important to insure the quality and , almost the goodness of character that kind of thing . 
where do you work ? 
and they have a policy for testing . 
if they make you an offer , then they 'll test you right before you start . 
and i guess the only drawback i can see to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem . 
and that definitely happens . 
the drug tests they 're accurate 
but there 's always that margin of error . 
and that 's something to be aware of . 
another thing is , a lot of times they are n't that accurate . 
they are n't that sensitive . 
if you 're on a prescription drug of some kind what are they going to do about that . 
and i know they did n't catch that 
or else they would have said something . 
i 'm sure they screen for just a particular few types . 
although the literature they give with you says we do this 
and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for . 
i do n't know . 
electrical engineering . 
they test you before you start or before you even interview 
they essentially , made me the offer and then , did the drug testing thing after that . 
so it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests 
and then , they essentially give you the offer 
and then at that point they 'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that . 
so there 's some noise on this end . 
i 'm actually in a mall calling 
you probably wondered . 
what happens if you were to fail ? 
then do they give you one more chance or two more chances ? 
that 's a good question . 
i believe from what i remember of the literature if you fail they give you one more chance . 
they probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it . 
but once again , those things are not that accurate 
so there 's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail . 
are you working right now anywhere 
i 'm just about to finish my master 's in may and just interviewing with companies right now . 
a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there . 
and they , basically did the same exact thing . 
and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time . 
so , one of those things where we went through kind of an identical process . 
do they test you right now , at work too ? 
that 's one thing they do n't do is drug testing while you 're on the job . 
i think the unwritten rule is , expect it 
but they do n't do it . 
so . that 's good i guess . 
i do n't know . 
i have gone to a couple of parties since that time 
and while i do n't do any drugs myself , i 've seen some people who work there smoking a joint or whatever . 
and that 's the kind of thing that would definitely come up . 
but 
they do n't really do that . 
is it formal policy that they said they might test ? 
i 'm here . 
how do you feel about public schools ? 
our public schools are really poor , i feel . 
but we 're toward the bottom . 
but the system does n't allow for the corrections . 
how about you ? 
that 's interesting . 
and she has a young boy . actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there . 
and she complained quite a bit about their school system there . 
i ca n't really say much about the schools up here . 
i really do n't come from here 
and the schools down there are not bad . 
they 're pretty good . 
that 's great . 
but i know in a lot of rural areas they 're not that good . 
and he says the schools there are just terrible . 
i feel that we 're way behind . 
i have a son that is in the fourth grade 
and they have just now taken up division . 
that is slow . 
my husband and i go to the store 
and i feel like there are several areas that we 're just really , really slow in . 
and i do n't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system . 
what do you think 's wrong to cause that ? 
for one thing there 's not enough money in the school system . 
and the money they do have , they do not use it wisely . 
and that certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis . 
but more than that , i do n't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children . 
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you 're not at liberty to do something about it , other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal 's office . it can really be bad . 
that 's one thing i worry about . 
there you go , 
probably quite a few black people up there 
we 're from the county they marched in . 
is that right ? 
and there 's very , very few blacks . 
it 's not a problem because i hate to feel like they are a problem , although they are . 
you do n't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever , 
but then again . 
but it is a problem . especially in the inner city . 
there is no denying that , 
. 
you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who do n't understand , especially if there 's not a very well developed special education program at the school . 
and you ca n't put all the children in special education . 
that 's right , 
you ca n't do that . 
and the school that i went to there was fantastic . 
i really consider myself very , very lucky . 
but your teacher had control . 
i believe i was too . 
but , you 're right . 
with all this , do n't hurt the kids and do n't abuse their rights , you 've also taken something away from the discipline , i think . 
it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it , my son would be in private school . 
we just can not afford it . 
i was going to ask you if that was an option . 
you want to go first ? . 
you can start . 
one of the things they talked about was what do we think about a judge making the decision ? 
and i really do n't agree with that . 
i think that the trial by jury is better having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible . 
i do n't think that they could be objective in every case , every time . 
you know what i mean ? 
this topic is kind of mute . 
there 's no way . 
we could n't survive in a trial system without a jury . 
one man , one woman can never be objectionable in every case . 
that 's it . 
every person has their opinions 
and that 's why jury selection is often very difficult . . 
i feel the other thing too , 
they were saying what new ways could it , change the system . 
i really think that we spend a lot of time going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal , 
if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed . if they have been caught point blank in the crime . there 's no question 
it 's beyond a reasonable doubt . 
all these things . 
we 've gone through this over and over again . 
they should n't allow an appeal . 
and it can go on for ten , twenty , years . 
i think this is a little ridiculous . 
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers . 
that 's right . 
i work for a law firm . 
i 'm serious . 
and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the criminal system today . with plea bargaining . 
plea bargaining is a different story . 
plea bargaining is something completely different . 
that actually prevents trials . or at least speeds them up . 
i know . 
that 's what i 'm saying . 
i do n't know how it works exactly 
but they get lesser sentences 
and i understand that the jails are full of people and that they have to do something . 
but , i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it . 
you know what i 'm saying ? 
that a lot of states do n't have capital punishment . 
and i think they should . 
we do . 
they 're caught dead to rights . 
i just think that they 've taken a life 
and they should pay for it with their life . 
when you 're saying as far as the appeal procedure was concerned . 
we just have the case , 
his last appeal was denied two days before his sentence was up . 
so his appeal was denied 
and two days later he got out of jail . for cocaine possession . 
but that was absurd . 
there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence . 
and , i do n't know . 
what would you do to change it ? to make it better ? 
the , appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of . 
like i said , as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence , that 's absurd . 
there 's no way that could work . 
i do n't agree with that at all . 
imagine the guilt that person would have . 
there 's no possible way that you could feel good about yourself . 
if you had to do something like that , day after day . 
no one would want the job . 
not really . 
and like i said , everyone has their opinions about every case . 
do you think people should have a trial is they 're caught dead to rights , 
i feel that everyone is , entitled to a trial by jury . 
were there witnesses ? 
that you ca n't remove the jury regardless of the case . 
and there 's still mitigating circumstances . 
when you 're with a big company or a big organization , a lot of times the benefits are good 
and , the pay is regular 
but sometimes you do n't get tuned in to what 's going on . 
and i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that anybody could get in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you get to know what 's going on . 
and maybe that 's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do . 
what 's your feeling about benefits ? 
what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company . 
since i 'm kind of on the older side , i just feel like when i start talking about benefits , i 'm concerned about medical benefits . 
and so his medical benefits are so excellent , 
that 's really great . 
i work for a bank , western financial . 
and they do n't let me know really about anything that 's going on . 
even some of the immediate things that i need to know , i do n't know it until the next hour 
and all of a sudden we know we 've got changes made . 
we 're changing departments . 
we 're changing policies . 
we 're changing doing other kinds of things . which to me is disturbing . 
you are right there . 
i 'm pretty much on a low level as far as the company is concerned . 
but i do kind of like to know what 's going on and what 's happening 
and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if i had a little bit more information along that line . 
i work for the government 
and actually i work for the f b i . 
and so , there 's lots of things that we do n't get told . for good reason . 
but basically there 's lots of things that we should know about projects . 
i 'm an engineer . 
and i worked in the same lab with a guy 
and we did n't really know that much about each other 's projects for two years . 
and we should have , , 
we 're now collaborating . 
for two years we did n't . which was kind of stupid . 
and all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do . which i thought was kind of interesting . 
that is interesting . 
but , i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what 's going on . 
but of course most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know . 
and if you do n't really count . if you 're not part of the program you might not get told for months . 
but regard to benefits most big organizations have decent benefits like retirement and that sort of thing . 
and engineers are baggage as they get older , to most companies . 
and it 's very much like the military , 
it windows out . 
you think i 'm getting more money 
and i 'm getting more responsibility , 
i 'm doing this . 
but as you climb up that tree , pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree 
and pretty soon somebody falls off . 
i 've fallen off twice in the private sector . 
and , i can get up , 
i know . 
and he wants to go into engineering . 
and the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open 
and he 's interested in , basically , three different areas . 
but it 's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that . 
he needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what 's going to happen in another thirty years . 
and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical . 
he 's not ready to retire 
but his company is , closing up . 
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff . and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on . he 's getting cut back 
and he 's not ready to retire . 
he may be retired . 
i guess by what you said you do n't feel your privacy has been invaded anytime recently ? 
not really . 
that 's not really invading my privacy . 
i would n't call it invading my privacy by any means . 
and next thing you know someone calls and wants to sell you this or that 
and it 's real hard to tell them that you 're not interested . 
or you do tell them you 're not interested 
and that aggravates me . 
but i do n't know that you could call that invading my privacy 
but that does n't work . 
it does n't ? 
they get your name from if you enter any type of contest or anything . 
you put your phone number on there , 
they pass your phone number on to another company . 
or the newspapers , they just dial randomly and stuff . 
the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe . 
you call me one more time , i 'm going to stop subscribing . 
you call up during regular hours 
they have a special department , 
they 'll take your numbers out of their lists . 
and they call every month . 
and when you have more than one phone number , you get a call on each number you have . 
let me ask you about this . 
here 's something that has been kind of concerning me lately . 
they 're a department store . 
that she had visited a store there 
and they had this bill that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise . 
and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number . 
if you know a person 's social security number and their mailing address , and their mother 's maiden name you can , basically , become that person . 
if the purchase was made mail order , they should have a record of where it was shipped to 
and since it was n't shipped to her address , she could prove that it was n't her . 
if it was some coming into the store and stuff , then whoever made the purchase would have had find some kind of document 
they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature 
and if they ca n't provide a signature they 'll have to eat the charge . 
because she wo n't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there . 
we got it cleared up eventually . 
what happened , 
i 'm of the age that could have gone , although i did n't 
and looking back on it , i tend to think it was mostly a mistake . 
on the other hand the more i learn about the history , the more i see it was incremental decisions . any one of which was sort of understandable at the time . 
but on the whole i think it probably was the wrong thing to do . 
how about you ? 
i was just in high school when it ended . 
i was in the last lottery . 
and i was glad it was over by then . 
i 've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there . 
just because we did n't really do anything when we went over it seems like . 
i work with several that were over there , 
and for some of them it was just kind of not so much a holiday , 
i guess that 's how they tend to talk about it . 
but that they just kind of lived out in the woods 
and ever now and then , they 'd go and shoot their rifles 
and then they 'd , come back 
but that they were n't really allowed to do anything . 
it 's funny . 
and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was almost a personal struggle among these three , 
i guess you 'd have to call them great men in some sense . 
they 're certainly all leaders 
and , with their nations pretty solidly behind each one of them . 
looking back , it seems like that was only partly true . that there might have been a better place to draw the line . 
i guess you can say that a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight brought the cold war to an end . 
but i do n't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to call the bully out and beat him . 
they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line , beat them and they would n't come forward . 
and we were wrong . 
like i said , the more i hear about it , the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable . 
i think we did learn some lessons that we were n't prepared for , 
the other wars seemed like a valiant war . 
they seemed like a valiant thing . 
you knew who was good . 
you knew who was bad . 
and it was a traditional battle of , kind of good versus evil , if you know whichever way it is . 
the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who 's good and who 's bad 
it 's ambivalent , 
what about the domestic effects 
i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it possible and even popular to criticize the government . 
it 's dying now , 
this desert storm stuff may have killed it . 
but my only complaint is i really do n't . 
so that 's why i concentrate on weekly magazines . 
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you 'd like ? 
i do n't think i have the time to really become a student in every article . 
and so i like the weekly magazines because it gives me the high points of what 's going on . 
but many times the local news kind of suffers . 
that 's right . 
you 're very close actually . 
it 's almost a bedroom community for the capital . 
and for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events 
and i do n't really feel as though i 've gotten sufficient dose of news that way . 
a lot of my information comes from several sources . 
i think it 's fairly objective 
and i always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative . 
and while there 's an inherent filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read i always figure it 's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of favoring the other side . 
that 's potential indication of balance . 
and , generally , i really do believe they are pretty balanced . 
i also read time magazine 
and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections of the articles and the front section 
the mercury and the chronicle are the only things that up there . 
did you use to live around here ? 
i know exactly where that is . 
we get the mercury which i generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper . 
and i like a lot of the articles there . 
but the other thing that you referred to that always sounds really interesting to me is called c span . 
we have both c spans here . 
both ? 
the whole thing was run on that 
and also , they have the , parliament 's question and answer period . 
i never say that . 
that would have been interesting . 
it , 
i think that 's always fascinating . 
and everybody was making noise in the background . 
but it 's usually the prime minister ? 
major . 
and i said it 's parliament . 
so i thought to myself , i ca n't wait . 
this is how i discovered the prime minister 's question and answer period . 
i have seen that 
budgeting activity in our household is , kind of an informal kind of situation . 
and my wife looks at all those bills that come in 
and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them , 
we really do n't have a formal budgeting situation . 
every time i 've ever tried one i 've just got wrapped in my inertia . 
and i 've just decided not to pursue it . 
what 's your budget situation ? 
actually i 've had a couple of different situations . 
my current one has been the most successful . 
and that left me with three teenagers . 
actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets . is n't it ? 
it certainly is . 
but at any rate , what happened was that i just absolutely put away all the credit cards . 
i did n't send them back . 
nothing . 
i just put them away . 
because there was one that it was really handy to have . 
if i absolutely had to have something , i could go use it . 
but mostly we just spent cash . whatever we had . 
and if we did n't have it , we absolutely did n't spend it . 
my parents came through the depression . 
i 'm not sure how old you are . 
my parents too . 
late thirties , 
and my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house . 
and that 's kind of the way i was raised . 
and so i 'm not a very demanding person in that aspect . 
for quite a period of time , i just flat did n't spend any money . 
now , meanwhile , i had a building bank balance . 
and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have , i would have the cash to buy it right then and there . and not ever have to spend any money on interest . 
that 's good . 
and that 's the way i 've operated ever since then . 
and if something goes on sale and i do n't have the money , i still do n't buy it . 
we got a monster bill coming in . 
but we also have zero interest being paid . 
and we pay it off as it goes . 
and that 's the way i do my credit cards now . 
so we never really get that much over extended . 
i do almost all my purchasing on credit cards . 
but it 's the fact that i have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come , i can pay them in full . 
we 're doing that . 
two new pieces in the family room and new carpet . 
we 've just been spending , spending , spending . 
but we have n't really done anything for a long time because we 've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year . 
we do n't have that . 
it 's time for you to do these things then . ? 
it 's about time that we did that . 
but , the terrible part about it . i 've looked at it all 
and it all looks still pretty good to me . 
why ? 
why not replace it . 
but too late , 
we 'll never find that out . 
this is so funny . 
that 's wonderful . 
but you 're lucky to have her because if you 're like me and you have difficulty spending money , you need somebody to help you spend it . 
certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should , be or not . 
i do n't spend that much money . 
we sort of take care of the kids when they were 
and they got through school . 
and that was the major decade of expenses . 
but as far as any formal budgeting we just apparently have been very fortunate . 
when we want to go out to eat , we go out to eat . 
we never really have to program money for that or make choices . 
i have n't had an awful lot of incidents regarding child care . 
but , that 's about the extent of it . 
and they do n't pay very much 
and that 's a terrible kind of thing 
and i do n't think my children have ever been subject to that 
but my wife did n't work 
and so we really did n't have that much exposure to it . 
i am a working mother . 
i have three children 
i 've had various different alternatives , child care arrangements 
and like most working mothers i 'm really not defensive about it . 
i personally feel in our particular situation , i 'm a much better mother when i work out of the home 
and my kids are very secure , well raised children . 
my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities . 
it is a problem . 
but as you pointed out , i think the real problem is the low pay child facilities 
that is all they can afford . 
and then as they got older , they went to schools 
and they were wonderful . 
and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things . 
that 's interesting . 
but we really truly did pay a fortune . 
we were paying at one point about five hundred dollars a week for two children . 
you must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that . 
i 'm a physician . as is my husband . 
and i felt very good about working . 
i 'm a pediatrician actually . 
but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children 
and we all know the kind of things that you 're supposed to look for . i think , 
not all of us . 
you know the kind of things you 're supposed to look for . 
i 'm an engineer . 
i think it 's real important that you have a place that , first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they 're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in . 
and we had a really wonderful arrangement , 
i 'm with the university actually 
and they had a wonderful program that started at age three 
and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work . 
they had things like gardens and lots of pets 
and they had a four to one teacher student ratio . 
most of the teachers had degrees . 
five hundred dollars a week . for two kids . 
that 's incredible . 
it was incredible actually . 
but it was good . 
at that time there were two children 
and they were in special programs 
and each one was a little over two hundred a week 
and then , in addition , i paid a little bit extra . 
they really had some great opportunities . 
sometimes they do put them in fairly low paying situations . 
somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare 
and that 's a good starting wage 
but three hundred dollars a week does n't go very far on child care . 
my youngest child is eight . 
something like that . 
but you made the comment earlier , why would someone be interested in children . 
there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences . 
and i think they have captured a certain market . 
as a pediatrician , one of the things we 've been real concerned about is the infections . 
i guess you 're probably in the same situation we 're in . 
we 're kind of past having to provide child care . 
our kids are grown up . 
we do n't have any grandchildren yet . 
how old are your children ? 
so they 're getting there . 
they 're going to be getting there . 
there 's no prospects right away for anything to happen . 
i see . 
i have five children . 
and she 's a teacher 
and what she does is she , teaches at a preschool . 
and they let her bring her little daughter in for free . 
but she just works part-time . 
and she has to work full-time 
and it 's just tearing her apart . 
and the baby just screams . 
and she just screams . 
even if she knows that they 're fixing to get ready to go over there . 
they 're not even there yet . 
it 's hard . 
and her mother stays home 
and they live with us as orange county is really expensive . 
they live with us 
and so , of course , we love it . because we get to see this cute little baby all the time . 
she used to work in the preschool and child care 
and , here she was a provider 
but there 's only so much one person can do . 
she said it 's so awful . 
she said she 'll never put her child in a preschool . 
i 'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere . 
but it 's really very difficult 
what did you do when your kids were growing up ? 
the first ten or twelve years , i stayed home . 
and then after that i went to work . 
then i had one job 
supposed to be good recommended person from the church 
and i knew her personally . 
she had two kids of her own and everything . 
but i quit my job because i could n't stand how she was taking care of my child . 
first of all her children were sick all the time . 
so when my son stayed over there , he got sick . 
he got sick , 
same thing that her kids had ? 
that day i was saying he 's sick . 
and she goes , he has the same thing that all my kids have . 
that 's what he got . 
goes , , 
but then what happened is , i said , he just threw up 
so she said she 'll keep him home 
and he 'll probably just sleep anyway . 
you know , what 
as soon as he went there , the teacher took one look at him 
and he threw up again 
and they put him in the nurse 's office . 
guess so , 
called her 
and they said that he 's sick . 
she was n't home . 
all her kids were sick 
but she was n't home . 
why did n't she keep him home with her ? 
she did n't do that . 
and i had to leave work . 
and i found out he was still there at school . 
and they were calling me 
and they said somebody 's got to pick him up . 
and i kept thinking that she was going to pick him up because she only lives two blocks away from the school . 
i was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff . 
and he had a hundred and four fever . 
they could n't give him anything because they 're not allowed to at school and everything . 
i was so furious . 
i quit that job 
and i stayed home for awhile longer . 
then i went and got a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better . 
a little more flexibility . 
you can come and go . 
but i have n't had any really very good experience with child care . 
when our kids were small we had a couple of good women who would often get them to come to the house . 
i 'll let you start , i guess . 
i 'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing 
and i 've got some very definite opinions about it . which have n't changed all that much from my first reactions from when they announced it . but developed a little more , but have n't changed that much . 
what about you ? 
are you involved at all ? 
i 'm not , 
a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test . 
i do n't know . 
my feeling is that when there 's immediate threat to life and limb should somebody be under the influence of drugs , i 'd be willing to support that . 
for example train engineers . 
and i guess air traffic controllers . i would n't want them to be on drugs . and airplane pilots . 
but where it 's not necessary in that regard , where it 's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property i would seriously question it . 
that 's mine . 
i go back , 
it 's not , 
the constitution does n't apply . 
but it seems to me that it still should . 
our company 's doing it because they 're a government contractor . 
and so some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts 
so it 's the government that 's mandating it to a certain extent ? . 
and our company has taken that and gone all the way . 
first off we do n't have enough courage to pick out the people that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage because that would offend them if they were n't . 
so we 'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and , make it all even . 
and , 
then 
so it 's , a complete random testing 
it 's random in the sense that you do n't know when . 
it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested . 
and i sit at a terminal and write software all day . 
it , certainly has no life threatening capabilities in my job . 
and , 
i agree that there are , jobs that are definitely life threatening 
and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable and proper . 
i agree . 
there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results . 
or , i should n't say high 
i mean several percent . 
that i will give credit to our company for in that , i think there 's a couple of levels of tests in terms of drugs . 
it 's not quite that simple , 
but it 's fairly simple . 
kind of a coarse kind of test . 
coarse kind of test . 
now let me ask you this . 
so this is obviously not a condition of employment that you subject yourself to this . 
they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody . 
and at that time i could justify it in terms of someone new coming in , you do n't know . 
are you in the middle of anything ? 
i 'm not in the middle of anything . 
about the last thing i did 
about maybe close to a year ago now i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house . 
the whole thing ? 
that was fairly large undertaking . 
did the framing and all ? 
we were n't sure how to do that 
maybe you and i should get together . because when i had my last big project , i had the contractor do the framing 
that 's the exact opposite . 
we put the roof up and did all the roofing and put all the interior walls up . 
we just did n't do any of the sheetrock wall work 
and that 's it because you have 
we did n't know a thing about any of that 
my wife wishes i had n't done that . 
it looked very hard to do 
i did n't think we could do it and make it look professional . 
so , we left it to somebody who does it for a living . 
i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy . 
probably so 
and we 'd never done it 
so we just left it alone . 
i guess , 
so my vast experience of home owner 's knowledge is not very much . 
so it 's just what i have to do , more or less , around the house for my parents 
you framed in new square footage 
or was it stuff that was already enclosed ? 
it was brand new . 
brand new 
we started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house 
and you knew how to do the framing ? 
my dad knew how to do most of it . 
we 'd gotten a couple of books 
and then he just started doing it . 
i do n't know . 
he did all the flooring himself . 
he put the whole floor in 
and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there . 
it 's not enclosed . 
it 's just somewhere to drive another car to park 
do you build on slabs down there 
or did you build it up off the ground ? 
it 's off the ground . 
on the piers ? 
you had those poured 
or you did them yourself ? 
we did those ourselves 
you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete ? 
the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of . 
i 've done one , 
i helped somebody do one of those before . 
but we did n't do that way . 
i designed it from scratch and did it 
did a pretty good job . 
those are nice . 
they 're pretty forgiving . 
you can always tear stuff out and redo it . 
that 's not near , like building a house or anything 
those are nice . 
especially when you get done , you 've got something . 
i do n't know , 
i like them . 
you just sit down on the deck and do whatever . have a barbecue 
that sounds nice . 
all done by yourself , 
i had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes 
so we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts . 
and then the rest of it i just did . 
a contractor friend helped me with some of the foundation work 
it was about four or five hundred square feet . 
the same size as the addition that i just put on 
that 's a good size deck . 
so . 
it 's not that expensive . 
i think it cost me three dollars a square foot and no less than that . 
cost me about five hundred dollars , six hundred dollars all together . 
that 's good . 
that 's not bad at all . 
it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is . 
but even in this little town , it 's not cheap at all . 
i was surprised . 
i 'd be surprised if it was n't cheaper where you are . 
it 's probably more there . 
it probably comes from where you are . 
it probably does . 
i 'm not sure 
when i drive through that area , that 's all i see is pressure treated lumber yards . 
it 's nothing but woods down here . 
but that was just when i was a kid 
but i do n't know , 
we 're a college town 
so that does n't help us out any . 
gas is a dollar twelve a gallon , 
so that 's probably about what you 're paying 
that 's a lot easier . 
you 've got something going all the time . 
with regard to jury trials . i really feel as though whatever system has been used historically is really the only kinds of things that you can use . because the jurisprudence is based on accumulated body of law . 
so i really do n't think they can really do much of anything to change it . 
what do you think ? . 
i do n't think so . 
it makes you wonder had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome . 
maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that 
but then the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently 
and the other two guys sat in the car 
that 's bad . 
and they did n't get beat up . 
and they 're going to rebuild 
and it 'll be even better . 
what do you think , 
some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area ? 
that 's right . 
they 're only going to suffer . 
and you might even be able to use it for a bombing test site . 
they 're only going to suffer . 
they 've defeated themselves with their looting and violence . 
i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that are n't black or do n't live there or whatever , we all saw the same thing on the tape 
everybody is saying this is going to be a new era 
the average person is going to take a look at that and say , suspicions confirmed . 
they 're a bunch of animals . 
how can you really deal with an environment where you 're going to lose everything . 
i know . 
it 's really ridiculous . 
and i 'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and pursued it because i 'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing . 
those deaths . 
no tears . 
but i suspect a number of them . 
you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot in the street . 
or beaten . 
no one would have stopped me . 
that 's exactly how i feel too . 
they would n't have stopped my car for anything had i seen them coming . 
and i say wait a minute , 
and i do n't think like that . 
i 'm a government employee . 
in what section of the government do you work ? 
i 'm with the f b i . 
that 's interesting . 
and he wanted another collection a year later . 
and so this is my seventh call . 
i see . 
and you say you have some strong feelings about the issue ? 
i do as far as immigration as a whole goes . 
i think that we simply must start accepting everybody in the world . 
there just is not going to be room for all of us . 
we do n't have jobs now . 
i think when we come to a time of recession that it 's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time . 
i hope you 're one of the employed right now . 
i am one of the unemployed right now . 
i was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company 
but they had two thousand applications . 
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners here doing my line of work . 
and , of course , i 'm not perfectly happy about not having a job . 
how do you feel ? 
i 'm a little bit ambivalent . 
and i think one of the problems with immigration policy like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it in terms of what really is driving it . 
they 're not willing to tell the truth . the same way with issues of race and things like that . 
right now i believe there are two policies that the government uses to modulate immigration . 
three actually . 
one is at the high end , 
they always want to be able to do some brain draining . 
they 'd like to be able to get the top people in any field 
and so they can almost always find room for someone like that . 
at the bottom end , they are always willing to let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the , powerful people in that area . 
those are two things that i think are going on . although i do n't think the politicians would tell you that . 
and i think you 're right in both cases . 
and i think probably it 's pretty important right there . 
i think they 're a very difficult group to integrate into society . 
they 're very difficult group to find jobs and , places for . 
and so i do n't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem in that they 're pretty miserable where they are . 
actually i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here . 
and it would have nothing to do with political situations . 
it would have to do with poverty . 
i know about it . 
and the two of them together . 
it 's just as well , 
but there 's some differences in the immigrants , that we 're getting now . 
i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration . 
, they do n't bother to learn our language 
i really feel strongly about this . 
around here we have a program where we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers . 
so they actually have about three passes at this collection . one for the regular trash , one for the bottles and cans and one for the newspapers . 
but i gather you do not separate the bottles and cans . 
they do that on the truck . 
they separate them as they , dump them . 
and one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there . 
and i think they 're running out of . 
the sanitary landfill is running out . 
i know . 
and , in fact despite all of our open space out here , landfill space is still very hard to come by . 
you 've got a lot of nothing out there , 
but if somebody can make a regulation about it , they will . 
that 's pretty upscale trash situation . 
i do n't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques getting rid of the heavy metals . 
actually i 've been involved in recycling for . 
back when i was in graduate school , i did all of the recycling of the paper from the computer center 
and in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper . 
that 's certainly getting into the swim of things . 
i think it should go to the heart of the matter though and say , guy , 
everybody gets five pounds of garbage that they can throw away . 
but more than that every week you 've got to pay by the pound . 
i think they 'd be very careful about how they bought stuff . 
i think that 's a wonderful idea . 
the only alternative i would see is if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would speak more directly to the space needs and the landfill 
and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight . 
it 's a opportunity to stay alive really . instead of trying to exist on the good health of my youth . 
and what i like to do is i like to stretch out 
and i like to run , 
i like to run , get my heartbeat up . 
i like to run about two and a half miles . 
and i kind of think it 's a lot of work 
but i think it 's a lot of work 
but i think it 's the amount of effort that 's required to stay healthy , . 
and unless you do something like that , you 're going to get sick . 
i 'm pretty bad about that . 
i 'm lazy . 
i should , i know 
i always say that i need to start running 
and i 'm going to try and do that this summer . 
because i never have time . 
i always put it off . 
by the time i get back from classes it 's late at night 
because i 'm getting a gut here . 
i got to get back into shape . 
two years ago i started having trouble with my knee . 
i figured it 'll go away . 
i 've had to reduce my program 
i need to get back into swimming instead of running . 
if i ca n't run , i should be able to swim . 
i 'm such a terrible swimmer 
but if it gets longer than that i start not doing anything . 
so i got a real problem in that regard . 
or else you 'd be out there doing it . 
i do it , i guess , 
i 'm going to do it because i want to get in shape . 
once i get into it and if i get into better shape then it wo n't be as much of a chore to me . 
it 's always a chore . 
and i just know that i 'm going to get blown away with some piece of nonsense . 
some health related thing is going to blow me away . 
that 's the same way , 
i got too much weight on right now . 
i need to lose at least twenty , . 
but it 's just i 'm busy . 
i 'm doing a lot of traveling 
and it creates a problem when you 're on the road . 
what other programs other than running ? 
have you ever done anything at all ? 
i have . 
or last year i belong to a club right here . 
got kind of expensive to renew . 
that was a little bit too much money . 
what club are you with ? 
i 'm sorry ? 
what club were you with ? 
so you 're downtown . 
it 's plaza . 
there 's a holiday spa down there on k street something like that . 
and that 's pretty good . 
but evening time it gets pretty busy . 
but generally i can get in and get a program . 
and i got a problem ever since my knee went bad , of getting back solidly into it . 
and so i really do n't want to , back off on it . 
it 's something , 
i think i 'm young , 
i should get started getting into shape . 
i do n't want to , 
at one point it 's going to be too late to do it . . 
when you 're young , you can abuse all your systems 
and you can recover . 
why do n't you start ? 
i do n't know . 
i 've been pretty successful with that . 
things you already owned or things that you 've picked up just to do that ? 
what ? 
are they things you already owned 
i 've done some other things too . . 
i 've done both . 
and we 've done it a couple of times . 
i guess that we 've been fairly successful with those . 
that 's a kind of low risk sort of project , is n't it . 
that 's a good way to get started . 
i have a , really nice desk . a nicer desk than i could afford . which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital liberated it after a fire 
and it turned out to be a nice desk . 
a kit . 
. i 'm jealous . 
still had to cut it and everything , 
but it was fun . 
i 've built my own deck and things like that . 
and i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too . 
but i ca n't say i use them very often . 
they come in handy at the most unusual times . 
and that 's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel . 
i 'll bet . 
and now i use it twice a year maybe . 
i do n't know , 
because he was tell me the ones that you dial in are n't all that great . 
they 've plastic parts and stuff . 
the ones that what ? 
that you dial in on the side . 
i have never even looked at one closely . 
how strong is it ? 
any time you buy a tool as a package the bits that they give you are low end . 
so a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars 
and if you 're going to use for a lifetime i suppose it 's worth it . 
because , 
i imagine if i go and sharpen them myself they wo n't last . 
they really get hot do n't they ? 
and they dull after awhile . 
and that wears a bit down . 
and routing hardwood will take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast . 
i 've cut some one by eight oak before . 
was that fun . 
big solid pieces of oak are just tough . 
that was with a circular saw . 
is this going to be fun ? 
i 've used mine on treated wood 
and now all my blades need sharpening . because treated wood will also chew them up . 
treated wood can really make you sick too .
