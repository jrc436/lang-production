what kind of car are you thinking of buying next ? 
and i hate it . 
do you really ? 
what year is it ? 
i 've had one problem with it after the other . 
and there 's no reason for it 
fix or repair daily or find them road dead . 
there you go . 
my electrical system shorted out like two or three times , 
it would have been two thousand . 
she likes those . 
those are nice cars . 
what things do you consider when you buy a car ? 
the gas mileage for one thing , 
and i 've always had stick shift . 
the next car i get i want it to be automatic . 
i see . 
i hate driving anyway , 
especially when you 're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time . 
and when you work nine to five , or eight to five , and you 're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately . 
that makes it very frustrating . 
everybody i 've talked to that owns one , has been real pleased with it , 
and i like the driver 's air bag , 
i like that . 
they really look sporty . 
i like that too , 
but i could n't afford the insurance on one of those . 
and we found a real good interest rate , 
when they 're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that , they really come down on their prices 
and we looked around at used cars , 
and we really could n't afford the payments on a used car , 
and we ended up with a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car , and the payments . 
that 's what i 'm paying on mine now . 
they said it had to be a first time buyer 's car or whatever , 
and they 're charging me unreasonable interest , 
but i 've got eight more payments 
and it 's paid for . 
that 's great . 
it 's a good car 
i 
when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door . 
so in addition to everything else we got off the car , all we had to do is show them our papers on our first car , 
and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it . 
so we got a four door this time , 
and i sort of went more for the comfort factor , 
and i liked the smaller cars , 
but i 'm a bigger person , 
and i really like comfort driving along the road and stuff . 
that 's another big factor of mine . 
next car i get 's going to be a four door too . something with some room . 
and you buy groceries and stuff like that .
