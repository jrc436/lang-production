do you do a lot of cooking in your family ? 
i do some every now and then , 
i work 
and my wife 's home during the day 
so she usually ends up doing most of it . 
when i was single we used to always cook , around the house . 
do you like to cook . 
i really like it , 
there 's a few dishes , 
so we definitely have different tastes , 
but that 's neat though , because you get to have different stuff . 
i 'm a pretty bad cook . 
i 'm pretty bad . 
my husband is really good , 
he put himself through college working in restaurants . 
and he 's much better cook than i am , 
so , when i was home i still cooked a lot 
and now , i went back to work about a year and a half ago 
so , one of the things that he took over was the cooking 
and the kids are thrilled , 
they 're really happy , that i do n't cook anymore . 
they 're preferring it now . 
they say dad , let dad cook mom , 
let him do it 
but so do you have kids ? 
you obviously have one . 
two , 
you have two . 
one is nine months 
and the other is two and a half . 
two and half . 
i was just going to say , makes a difference in what you eat does n't it . 
or are you not at that stage yet ? 
it does . 
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we , eat . 
she makes six different meals , 
like to have one thing , 
the other one like hot dogs , 
i could n't . 
i could n't do that , 
but 
let me think , 
i was thinking of the one recipe that we made . 
i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy , 
what 's that . 
it has a french name , 
and you pour it over rice , 
what is that , 
i ca n't even remember what the recipe 's name is anymore , 
and it sounds sort of funny 
but it tastes really good . 
so we had a lot of seafood before we moved down here . 
and that sounds delicious to me . 
that sounds great . 
we 're just thinking of having , a dinner party . 
we went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game , 
they had a murder mystery , 
and you came dressed as one of the characters 
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner , 
and it was really fun 
and so we were going to try doing it ourselves , 
and that kind of interrupted the game , 
and then you can make that ahead 
that 's another thing 
i have a problem with my wife , 
she does n't like the beef dishes . 
she likes the chicken and fish , 
and , like i said , we always ate beef and pork a lot , 
i know , 
my husband did too . 
and they always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table . 
red meat , 
plenty of good red meat . 
my dad could eat , a meal with out any vegetables at all . 
my dad would n't know what to do . 
that you do , 
that 's just part of it . 
but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly , 
there was dishes that he really enjoyed , eating . 
there were several things that he liked 
but it never was really , something that he would have chosen . 
it 's just that i cooked 
so he had to put up with it . 
but there was one thing that he could n't stand 
and that was soybeans . 
i tried it once or twice 
and he just could not eat it , 
i was limited . 
it 's hard to get a protein content up then . 
that 's true . 
i like them every now and then for a change , 
it 's nice . 
some of the stuff is good , 
but it was a tremendous amount of cooking . 
and we had little kids at the time , 
when i was home with them , and it was just so much cooking , 
i do n't like to cook . 
and i 'm not really that great at it 
so it just turned out to be too much cooking . 
so i guess i 'll let you get back to feeding your little one there . 
he 's all done . 
he 's set , 
i set him down . 
or do you get into that , 
we used to do that , 
and that would be it . 
then be gone . 
i know , 
and i can do a pretty good pie , 
we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother 
and my mother taught me how to make it . 
i can make a pretty mean pie , 
but i do n't do it anymore because it 's just too fattening . 
we had the same kind of problem . 
it 's supposed to save you money 
but you eat three times the amount of bread that you usually eat . 
it tastes so good . 
you ever seen the starter bread , 
i ca n't remember what it 's called , 
you just leave it out , 
i 've heard of it , 
but i 've never done it . 
. 
that sounds pretty good . 
but it 's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad 
and then you add all these other ingredients to it , 
and then you make the bread 
but you pinch off a portion , or save a portion of it for the next time , or something . 
you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else 
and that 's how they continue the thing . 
i do n't know how safe that was . 
i know it sounded strange to me too , 
that 's true , 
that 's got to kill anything i guess , 
i 'll talk to you later . 
where are you calling from by the way , 
where ? 
it sounds so close . 
i know we 've got a good connection , 
that 's where practically everybody i talked to is from . 
i think that 's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state . 
they 're trying to get all different amount of people . 
that 's where we went . 
you did , 
but i grew up right here in falls church , right outside d c . 
we 'd like to get back over to the east coast , 
i 'll tell you . 
it 's nice over there . 
it 's sort of funny , 
things are doing pretty good down here , 
you could n't get a job to save yourself over there 
so we decided we 'll try in a couple of years , 
we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there 
cash . 
you probably could , 
you probably could , 
it 's good talking to you . 
nice talking to you too . 
take care .
