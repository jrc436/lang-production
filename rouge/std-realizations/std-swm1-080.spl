are
am
it 's
have it ?
just recently got
and we bought a house .
but unfortunately the house is taking my time up .
a club for a purpose
in about two years
with the guys here and then went out two weeks ago
played out there , and in a tournament
kind of
lay long enough to get rid of all my bad habits off
try a slice through a hook here
and ca n't do that
finally got out ,
've been watching quite a few videos and
have not been able to play
took out a few videos
i hope 's the right track and on .
and my handicap 's nine twenty .
that 's great .
like
been , too
've got my wife
that 's probably going to be one of the next investments
get out of the driving range
and hopefully we can start in .
bought her a set of clubs four years ago
n't
won the tournament the other day ,
she 's ready to get into it off ,
that 's good ,
same thing here
can get out and play a few hours of golf at least
and it 's not going to cost me , really an arm and a leg .
walk
do n't ride
a little exercise there
've got the same attitude
tell ,
eight or ten years ago , when now ,
then while and finally got into it
's been my main involvement
of winter when we ca n't do it the
it 's pretty nice .
and what my parents came down
was
we 're out playing golf ,
and they 're freezing cold back there ,
got into the service
now i just kind of let it and go , when
if one of the guys and then one day at work .
and said
've got my clubs ,
in quite a few years
got into it and then back out of it , and then
years to get back in there
that 's right .
really .
it 's really nice .
it is ,
it is , especially if you can find a lot of fun .
that be the hardest thing
that 's true of any sport .
you do n't want to go out and get
people do n't want to play with somebody
's too slow for them ,
somebody around your own handicap
that 's right ,
've never yet up
with a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else
that 's true .
always .
that 's true .
come out on ,
and they do n't mind if you make a mistake ,
it 's pretty nice and friendly out there
so that is .
and you ca n't find in all sports
that 's absolutely right ,
but playing with the same people
after a short period , once .
'd like to work up
a mixed league
for that and
whenever that 's next month ,
and it will then start ,
of years a
and they were just starting to learn ,
and they were shooting a hundred , hundred and twenty
so , it wo n't take
that 's good
that 's good ,
that sounds like a lot of fun .
and it 's something we can do together ,
she does n't do much hunting ,
she could care less about that .
she does
but golf would give her the exercise ,
she 'd be outside ,
give her something to do that
it sounds like we 've got real similar situations .
along took my wife and
and of the same situation .
and she talked the whole time we were out hunting and stuff ,
but she 'll make if that comes along ,
but it 's interesting ,
bowling bad if
you do n't
that 's right .
any novice how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it can pick up a club and learn right .
an in any aspect of it at all
that 's right ,
could pick two or three shots out of my game every time
can do it ,
just got to do it all on the same hole ,
and then it will get better ,
and you just keep going ,
you 're in and doing .
it really works that way .
first got back into it
did n't get it done and
need and
naturally anyway
the ball now will go straight
never broke a club or anything ,
'd get upset about it sometimes , but
do n't get upset any more
and that 's great .
talking to you
bet .
'll go back to work
like
see you later .
