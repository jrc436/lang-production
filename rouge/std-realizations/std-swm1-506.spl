one advantage of having the unanimous verdict is
.
and think a unanimous verdict help ensure that
you would have a problem that you would n't convict if you have one juror that 's very unreasonable in some way
have you ever served on a jury before ?
twice have
it was a pretty wild experience .
what sorts of cases were they ?
just small time cases
was so
they were .
they were n't
what was the verdict ?
the jury did
changed the one and
so it became unanimous after they turned it in
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in
but then it became unanimous .

so did it working out pretty well end up ?
it ended up working all right .
and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract ,
into very technical issues
wonder if the system works in educating the jurors about whatever issue are under discussion adequately and .
them enough to really know what 's going on
you said it was just sort of a matter of some kind bank in .
they get the trailer that seemingly was their property
it was on his property .
money from the bank to buy
have n't and
so they come to get it .
and he would n't
they get it back
and it was
so they 'd already taken it apart .
so they left it there
it and then when they came back later rained and got all in it
so they were suing him for the money ,
