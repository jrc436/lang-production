n't
so can work at home
and it is
but it does its job ,
what processor does it have in it ?
, do n't know
it 's so old .
what kind of work do you do on it ?
ratings television
and i some ratings and processing
and running some software
so it really do n't have to be anything sophisticated .
my husband do too
have , a fairly fancy one ,
of our customers for new products
and have
it 's so kind of fun ,
need buy a computer for the house
have n't just but
'd like to have one for the house too
i work on the computer all day at work , but usually my husband sometimes , says
do n't want to come home and have to work , too
in 's your husband , what group your husband ?
something with the defense
defense systems and electronics group ?
something like ,
so their name changed
.
the peripheral products division
i work in the airline , marketing group .
did n't even know they have anything like that
so many things that
they 're into so many different things ,
he had , one of those top secret things where he could n't talk about what he did
for
jobs but then .
half the stuff to do
he is a programmer ?
.
design engineering software
have a degree in management information , which are computer , but
of it the programming
have been at it for five years , but
could n't get a job right now probably even
it seems like it 's so much changed ,
such advances in computers
your husband use ever so
he does bring with him a little one home
he brought a portable one home , sometimes
but it quit working
so he brought it back ,
he brought one another home
but they did give him a new computer at work ,
.
and here in temple
those handy really
nice ,
he does n't have one of those ,
what is that ?
he does n't have one of those .
they are pretty handy because when i travel , it is easy to check messages ,
to your computer and dial in the phone
my husband , do n't have to travel
that 's good .
some people
'd like it , if he traveled a lot
.
, would love to have
but they are so expensive .
, do n't know
depends on what you consider expensive ,
real stuff high for now under two thousand dollars , which it would have been six , seven , eight , nine thousand dollars just a few years ago
compared to what it used
but it 's a lot to put into one .
two thousand dollars are n't just to a lot of people pocket change .
that 's right .
it 's not .
it 's not pocket change ,
so it 's major .
when they start needing something that will be different then
.
do some of my husband 's papers
his but was
did a lot of his papers
they come in ,
how many different types of packages
at home ?
really do n't use ,
most of it 's just stuff that 's been written in house that i use .
those two
probably you use or something like that , for your entry stuff that you are data , talking about
, a lot of the data entry stuff they
worked for this company before
me working at home doing things other
that worked out pretty good then .
it did .
a lot of
something really minor
but , it 's something that nobody else , want to do
and it 's time consuming .
so , it keeps in the company you ?
that 's right ,
it gives me a paycheck ,
goes for three to four weeks , three times a year
the ratings television do n't come out all the time
they come out , only four times a year
could bring a home computer and do stuff
's always phone
do something always
right now , we 've got several new products coming out , especially
lots of
you take a home computer to work
need be at the office , too , but
deal , with other all those things that happen
i bet
was it and
have done before that , a couple times
that would make that much easier , but it
just home instead of bringing home a computer
that 's right .
do n't even have to go into the office
maybe have been into the office once in the past three years
whatever courier or
that sounds nice really .
it 's real nice ,
, just to deal with them on the telephone
know who they are talking
most of them
ca n't say
a lot of people around there changed
most people know
but do n't
me by name and phone voice
got like that as well
them by the telephone
it 's been good talking to you ,
got
we sort of stayed
we tried .
it 's hard to sometimes .
we 'll talk later to you .
