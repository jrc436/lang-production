\section{Discussion}
There is some amount of convergence in the performance based metrics. Middle and Early seem to do the best. Interestingly, this correlates very well with reduced memory. Problematically, our measure of memory is somewhat incomplete. 

Also from the metrics, we can glean that Middle seems to be using a mostly incremental process, while Early seems to be using the exact opposite. While it's not entirely clear while our condition would cause that, the penalty is substantially reduced, as the model is not presently measured on the semantic information it has to store. 

While models like this have no formal system of evaluation, we take the vague convergence of many metrics to be a sign of success for the modeling paradigm.
