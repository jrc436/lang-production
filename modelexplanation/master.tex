\begin{abstract}
We present a model of language production in a way that can be considered cognitively plausible but adaptable enough to consider among a range of possibilities. While this model will produce naturalistic output, it does not consider realistic output in a vacuum to be useful. Thus, it will produce the best output it can while maximizing cognitive plausibility. Nonetheless, between two models that are cognitively plausible, we will consider the one producing more human-like output to be more human-like. Our goal is thus to use cognitive modeling to answer several questions about how language production actually works.
