do you all have a budget ? 
we do . 
and we have three teenage daughters 
and they 're very expensive . 
so we have somewhat of a system . 
it 's kind of hard to explain . 
we 've actually gone just recently , to having two checking accounts . 
we always had just one . 
and now we are having two . 
it 's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it 's very personal . 
that 's kind of the way i feel about it . 
my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances 
and of course , we 're like a lot of people . 
we just scramble through month to month . 
do you have a two income family or one income ? 
we have a two income family . 
she also works 
but she enjoys it 
and she 's good at it . 
and one of these days i am going to do something about that i believe . 
you know how that goes , 
she handles it pretty well . 
she writes all the checks once a month . 
is her career related to finance or accounting ? 
she 's an annuity administrator 
and so she works for an insurance company . 
but she enjoys it . 
she likes keeping track of all that stuff 
so that 's sort of related to her field a little bit . 
sort of . 
and we 've experimented with , budgets from time to time , 
you have to keep up with them . 
so a lot of times , we just kind of play it by ear . 
we try to keep our retirement and our savings kind of automated 
so we never see that money . 
just taken directly . 
it 's just taking it out . 
we do the same thing . 
and that 's kind of handy . 
because if you do n't see it , you do n't miss it . 
you do n't spend it . 
you have something to take it out . 
that 's exactly what we 've always done 
they 've always had , where they match your funds , 
sometimes if you save so much , then they will match it . 
we 've done that too . 
but , my husband works for an insurance company 
and he has now for about ten years . 
but he was with another company before that , 
i work also , 
but i only have a part time job 
and i get paid very little 
we just transfer it into my account 
and then i use that for food , household expenses , 
and then i add my own check to that 
and then with that i try and handle some of the clothes that the girls need and things like that , 
it sounds like you all pretty much do it the same we do . 
just kind of play it by ear , but keep the deductions . 
i mean he works it out every month and breaks it all down . 
i am given so much money a month , 
so i am suppose to kind of get the food out of that . 
i do n't ask for more . 
i just try and make it on that . 
because i think when you go to the grocery store , you can go crazy with all the choices that you have 
and you can really waste a lot of money that way . 
how long have you been married ? 
about five years . 
so you 're just really getting started . 
so do you have a family too ? 
i 've got one little girl . 
not really . 
not too bad . . 
not like she will later on . 
you will see that all of a sudden you 're trying to decide whether you are going to do soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do 
and then you really have to start saying now what can we afford , 
what can we do here 
and then you have to really sit down and plan some more 
but i think when we were back at your age , we did n't have much of a budget 
and then as the girls got older , i think we did more and more of that . 
more budgeting as they got older . 
but what do you do ? 
i 'm an electronic technician . 
i guess we 're not suppose to talk about those things . 
i 'd better get back to the subject . 
but budgeting . 
i found i feel a lot better . 
we use to work out of one check book 
and it would be very hard for me because i would n't have any idea how much money i was spending in one month . 
now , i know exactly what i 'm spending 
and it 's so much easier ,
