are we going to talk about the public school system , what 's wrong with it or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it , what should be done about it
fantastic .
's about the funding of , the school system right now
evidently that 's a big problem .
it 's amazing ,
pay nearly enough to be doing what they 're doing
was
and really
but would n't
all the problems
about stress and pressure
, to tell what
probably half what most people
and we 're paying millions of dollars a year for what basketball people .
that 's right ,
just do n't understand that
do you have little kids or what ?
n't sure
about two years
that 's a school teacher ,
, almost four and a two year old three year
this coming not fall but the year after that
is it so
so we 're thinking about that .
what 's that going to be like .
are they
they or going
in our child 's education
we do n't trust the school system , that 's very sad ,
but if it does n't start at home , it 's not going to go anywhere
that 's true .
if you can not read or write or understand .
give me a break ,
that 's
my one thing
could n't believe that
's going to be good , for resale value on and so
that age , who 's going to be a definite concern to
you talked , before about the school funding .
there 's only necessarily the best way
but is there 's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids .
if they start raising for property taxes ,
right now .
do n't and think any politician 're going to do that ,
and the only thing , they would be tuition ,
it will work down below if it works at colleges .
having kids in school , of course , that 's probably the fair only thing to do
they pay out even more
and it 's going to hurt the middle class people , because they 're the ones that will probably have to carry the brunt of the load really .
that 's right .
that 's just unbelievable .
ca n't believe that
high and high school
you never heard about that .
we did n't even think about it .
what and now .
got kids that ,
or even being a student
thinking what 's going to be like for my oldest son , when he goes to school and it .
what 's going to happen ?
'm afraid for him to go
but again , you ca n't hold them back there .
and you want to encourage them to be active and everything in school ,
all the pressure that 's going on , with all the negative things
lot and tougher than
that was twelve years ago , i guess .
so it 's different lot now .
and what it 's going to be like
that 's right ,
that 's right .
'm afraid to even think about it
that 's
but do n't know ,
's just keep encouraging them
that 's all you can do .
you still got to be their best friend
or dealing drugs your parents
and if dealing drugs , they 're going to be in even worse shape .
that 's right .
stay away from that
them good values like drugs bad
have n't been in that kind of environment for a long time ,
but , it 's just amazing ,
to teach them good values .
that 's true ,
that 's true ,
, if someone else is going to stand up and say , of course .
think and
start them at the home
the rooted deep values
and that 's about right .
that 's all you can do .
that 's right .
got to be going ,
the call
to you today .
to
have a good life .
