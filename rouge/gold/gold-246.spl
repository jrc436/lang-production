i 'm guessing you probably do . 
i do n't have one in my home here . 
my parents have one 
and they live just about three miles away , 
so we use that one . 
i see . 
and they 're almost as close . 
and what kinds of things do you use it for when you go to them ? 
usually word processing something such as forms for things 
also i have a nine year old that i 've been home schooling for the last three years . 
the one that my parents have is an apple two e . 
and so she got me copies of several of the apple programs for school programs , 
and so we use those 
so , that 's part of it . 
my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things . his resume , his letter , 
he 's been applying for jobs and things , 
so that type of thing . forms for his photography business , and that kind of thing . 
i tell you 
once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly . 
my father had a software company , 
and we 're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing , here . 
but they 're kind of older 
so i 'm not sure that we 'll be able to get too many other programs for it . 
i 'm a writer by profession 
i thought i had died and gone to heaven because , i thought , they 're so wonderful . 
i have one of those . 
then 
mine 's broke at the moment , 
ours really needs to have some work done on it 
he does n't work there anymore , 
and once that happened , there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter . 
and so i learned that on there too , 
i have n't . 
i guess i have used it once or twice . 
it 's the one that 's on my father-in-law 's computer . 
that 's probably where you 've used it . 
so that 's the program that they 're using there . 
i have that on my computer here 
and that 's what they have there 
and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and already know the software . 
and i do n't know from my own experience , 
it may be improved by now 
that 's what i 've heard . 
going forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing 
just did n't match with the kinds of keys , you were using . 
and it does a lot of things too that if you do any kind of research or anything like that where you have to use footnotes , it is just wonderful . because it keeps track of all your footnotes . 
that 's neat . 
how wonderful . 
i had heard that that was a better one . 
and it was just awful . 
so i do n't know i think we have just become really spoiled . 
but i think , it 's a nice kind of way to be spoiled . 
i agree . 
clock , 
although i think we 've probably been talking at least ten minutes 
not too much . 
what kind of things do you write ? 
i was a technical writer for many years , 
and my husband and i actually met in a computer company . 
and he was an engineer . 
excuse me . 
but you do n't need to drag it down the hall . 
got a problem ? 
. trying to figure out what all that was about ? . 
that was the majority of my writing 
and for a while i had a partnership in an advertising agency with another woman who is an artist . 
actually i 'm not working anymore . 
i 'm a graduate student 
so i 'm doing a lot of writing 
i 've done a lot of different kinds , 
but i just know right now that i could n't have put out half of what i did 
so that 's been really great . 
so i 'm real spoiled . 
i 'm anxious some day to have one here . 
and they just talked the other day about setting something up again 
so hopefully pretty soon we 'll at least have the word processing . 
my nine year old i 've decided to teach her how to type using the computer , 
that 's great . 
those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on 
and it seems like it 's getting earlier and earlier with the children . 
that 's right . 
so i think that that would be a real , advantage to her to have that and do it early , 
we 've been , writing a story together . 
and i wanted her to put it into the computer , and then print it out and , make a book with it . 
and so i decided if she 's going to do that , it would be a whole lot easier if she could type . 
so we 'll slowly learn just to type here and then put the story in . 
that 's great . 
that 's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life , 
so . might as well start now ? . 
i agree . 
this is really going to be fun i think , 
and my husband is a ham radio operator
