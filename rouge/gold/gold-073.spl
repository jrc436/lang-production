let 's see , 
i believe in the trial by jury . 
and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody . 
i really agree with the innocent until proven guilty theory . 
i think that 's a good way to do it . 
that 's about all . 
i think basically we 're in a lot of agreement in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs some kind of legal definition . 
but for anything involving that , trial by jury certainly should be mandatory . 
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of , not having to take everything before a full court , 
is n't there a type of word called a jury duty now . 
and those cases are lesser degrees of magnitude , 
and he had his pockets full of stuff when he was caught 
that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say , your pleasure your honor , 
and there 's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing . 
but the way our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time . 
and we 're starting to stretch the true meaning of right to a speedy trial . 
that 's a good idea . 
do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury 
or do they need a six person jury or those kinds of things 
and the seriousness of it , 
how , 
is this open and shut like you were saying , 
or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened a jury like that . 
that could work . 
and although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers , maybe we do n't need to do that . 
good idea . 
and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case . 
and let 's get rid of some of this harassment suing . 
that 's a good idea . 
in the bible it says if you have something against somebody , to go to them first , and if that does n't work , then to go get somebody a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them , and if that does n't work , to take it to the whole church . 
so that 's right off that same kind of principle . 
you bet , 
that 's a good idea . 
that 's true , 
that 's true , too . 
the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that . 
it does n't work on that , 
but it 's based out of that . 
so that could work , 
i 'd forgotten what that 's called . 
what is that called ? 
that may be right . 
it 's in there some place . 
i think we both know that we 're talking about the foundation of our legal society . 
i know , 
but that 's a whole different subject . 
mine , too . 
mine , too . 
but it 's been a pleasure talking with you . 
same here . 
what part of the country are you from ? 
i was just being curious . 
that 's quite all right . 
so am i . 
that 's neat . 
are you really ? 
i 'll let you go . 
and it was nice talking to you . 
my pleasure . 
have a good day . 
you too .
