some of the dress codes different at different schools
about whether she would allow slacks
and she said she , do n't have
she did n't just
and said
try to wear a skirt
have sometimes and even for me
or they have week that you wear your different outfits spirit
for that particular school the
with some sort of hat
and you never know , though , sometimes when you 're going in
might be a week spirit going on
on what ,
so , would that kind of give you a clue
the long term stuff
so you are aware ahead of time of what is going on .
and do n't know ,
they have for the kids
one on the parents or the teachers
no blue jeans
wear with it
and do n't
but if you 're going to tell the kids , .
