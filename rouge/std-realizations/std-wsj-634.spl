is here
how do you feel about public schools ?
our public schools poor , i feel really
but we 're
but the system does n't allow for the corrections .
about how you ?
that is interesting .
had a young boy one when she was there and
and she complained about their school system there quite a bit .
ca n't really say much about the schools up here
really do n't come
the schools down
they are pretty good .
that 's great .
known , but in a lot of rural areas they are not that good
the schools there terrible just
feel we 're behind way
have a son who are in the fourth grade
and they have taken up just now division .
that 's slow .
to the store
several areas that we 're really , really slow in just
n't blame as the teachers
is wrong to cause
there is not enough money in the school system for one thing .
have , they do not use it wisely
certainly and that 's a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis .
but do n't think they have the authority to command the attention of the children
two kids in that class on constantly keep the class in an uproar and you 're when it and not
is that
go there
quite a few black people up there probably
we 're from the county they marched in .
is that right ?
and there are very , very few blacks .
not a problem
whatever prejudice or or
, but then
but especially in the inner city
there is
.
especially have to slow things down for people to do n't understand
and you ca n't put all the children in special education .
that 's right ,
you ca n't do that .
and was fantastic
consider myself really very , very lucky
but your teacher have control .
was too
but , you 're right .
you also have taken something away from the discipline
it 's really because if we could afford it , my son would be in private school of mine a concern .
we can afford it just not .
was going to ask you if that was an option
