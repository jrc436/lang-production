for certain types of positions drug
endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives
with that
driving like truck drivers and things
think definitely
's and
prior to hiring companies drug
within my company
do n't know of
feel like it 's really and
it 's
they go to the expense of testing over and over and over you all
's not a drug user and especially if your personality prove you 're not
at your work place other
about random
if that 's an invasion of certain people 's rights
if it 's not done fairly .
and that 's probably my question is how do you know that it 's done fairly .
do n't
then it 's
and that 's not necessarily fair .
it 's
but then it 's kind of like a lottery .
another person does n't win anything
and it 's
.
how do they pick their people ?
an initial drug testing at
but it is to identify the ones that have the problem
.
do you think that should be implemented in the work place
have a manager or supervisor
do n't have a problem with that personally not
think that might be a violation of someone 's rights but
personal problems for
and their manager assume they have a drug problem
if someone assumed of me that would
a drug user would normal behave when
your supervisor accused you of using drugs
've been in the same job for three years ,
three years in
've already and
what type of job do you have ?
's an environmental engineer
three times
in their lifetime
have for some reason so
that 's pretty high statistics .
or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone
at all .
it 's a legal job
so it 's really strange .
that 's odd .
have now for the prior job
from my company old
what the men hired did n't
or do they have the ability to say tested her
she negative up
do n't use drugs
they tested once just me .
but , used to work
was just one of the office folk
the people service but just across the board .
and
is it a rotation .
.
depends again , but in
are fixing power lines
the power lines and .
but they make those guys are the drug testing schedule .
.
they say , we 're testing tomorrow you
while test every three months you
so they know .
it 's made very clear .
have we spent our at least five minutes ?
think so .
nice to you
to you .
