you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team , or who you think will be doing well this year . 
and , course , we have duke university that was the national champions last year , 
so i 'm kind of hoping that they 'll repeat again this year . 
they have a lot of the same players back . 
this is college basketball . 
this is college , 
so , hopefully we 'll have a good year . 
and that 's probably all i saw . 
we have n't really followed them too much 
and none of them are our alma mater 
so , that seems to help . 
do you like professional basketball ? 
i follow it especially around the playoffs , 
and , maybe now that that 's over they 'll come out of it 
that 's an up and coming team , though . 
i hope they do something . 
they need to 
or they 're not going to have any of the team left at all . 
that 's somebody you can get behind and , be patient . 
kind of like the cowboys , i guess . 
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons . 
they , coming out of it this year . 
we 'll see if it 's held on . 
the bulls ? 
they 'll probably be pretty good . 
that 's true . 
that 's true , 
it will be interesting . 
it will certainly be different . 
i do n't know , how close i 'll follow them , though . 
and the season has n't started yet . 
i 'm usually more the end of the season person , 
and we need to talk about baseball 
the basketball season 's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks . 
it 's a long season . 
it is , 
i guess my mind went blank . 
it 's like last season was so long ago 
and i have n't really even started thinking about basketball yet 
but , this was n't a good subject , 
but , we 'll see how our predictions come true . 
it 's a little early . 
we definitely will . 
it 's good talking to you . 
good to talk to you .
