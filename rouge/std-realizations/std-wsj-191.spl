in the jury system
at all .
have taken justice criminal two classes
must you then
thinks the system is fine right now
think it should be by a jury
do n't think it should be either unanimous even
what about the idea that is one guilty only when proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt ?
of the idea then if everyone agrees that there should n't be any reasonable doubt a unanimous jury was
but if , it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable for some people doubt .
do n't know
course that there is
what they 're doing but .
have you served on a jury ?
never
, either have never
few my friends have
and do n't know what they 're doing and say
start just as soon as they and then
the prosecution and defense choosing the jury
they do n't want you on the jury .
they do n't want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system .
exactly .
that anyone can get out of jury just about ,
or not falsely arrested
tried by a jury of my peers
tried by a jury of people who had nothing else to do and were n't very knowledgeable ,
and do n't know ,
a little bit
have never even
was
was out , but
and apparently they thought
so did n't make any noise about it
come back
and said they
was out at the time , but
is so
, do n't know
there 's a lot of problems with the legal system
, do n't know
you could , if you just could have a simple majority or something pretty much
that 's hard to say .
so it is , saying , we do n't like the way he look
witness expert testimony
juries extremely vulnerable to sort of emotional pitches
them pay as much as possible
things like .
ca n't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury ,
having a jury at least not
do n't think the judge should make just the decision alone
going to decide
you 're the person 's fate .
a judge work together on
i wonder if that 's possible ?
the judge 's timing is worth too much , though
they pay compared to that judge those jury members very little money .
he makes put together in an hour than all twelve of them more money .
probably ,
but
somebody 's life is in twelve people 's hands
and those twelve people could sometimes care less .
because they kind of pick when out .
of course .
it 's political maneuvering .
will want to hang everyone ,
is the one other and
or sensible or rational juror
want that
it was a little bit harder to serve on juries not actually
an awful lot of intelligent people
they answer because you can do that , and the wrong way just one of the questions
say they just
at court
if it was a family members of theirs , though that was innocent , then they 'd want to be on that jury .
they would be
you 've and
it sounds like we need both get out there and serve on a jury .
called up too long before
would
is ready to go
they call me up yet
they will eventually .
it was nice talking .
it was nice talking .
