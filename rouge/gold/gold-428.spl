that a little town or a bigger city ? 
it 's not one of the bigger ones . 
maybe a little smaller . 
i talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town , i think . 
i forgot the name of the town . 
i thought maybe it was you . 
we 're supposed to talk about education . 
i certainly have some ideas since i 'm studying it now in college . 
i 'd say , first of all , they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading , writing , arithmetic in grade school , 
and it shows up . 
that 's one idea . 
do you have any ? 
i do n't know , 
and my dad is actually on the school board there , 
so , i kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on . 
that 's for sure . 
it used to be the pits . 
but i 'm just speaking overall across the country . 
something is definitely wrong . 
and one thing , they do n't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing , 
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year 
and they truly ca n't read 
so i do n't know how they expect them to pass history when they ca n't read anything even read a word problem in math . 
so that 's definitely a problem . 
another problem is you 're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do . 
so what do you think is good about the schools ? 
it depends on where you are . 
they 're all so different . 
that 's another thing about the united states . 
there 's no national curriculum , 
you may have half literature for the whole year , 
whereas in another one they 're going to concentrate on grammar and give you a little literature , 
grammar . 
it 's up to the teacher , in other words . 
so that 's kind of odd to me . 
it depends on what school you 're in and who your teacher is , actually 
so i guess we lucked out when we moved here . 
and where our kids might be in a great school , we 're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they ca n't read . 
but do you think that there should be nationwide curriculum ? 
i do n't know . 
i just read about that the other day , 
and i had never even thought of it . 
actually it makes sense to a certain extent , 
because sometimes a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that did n't even learn what they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach according to her plan , 
so i guess if there was a national curriculum we 'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn . 
so unless we want to keep paying for these people that ca n't make it in society , we 're going to have to do something . 
who do you think it should be done through ? . 
i do n't know . 
obviously nobody 's smart enough to have figured it out yet , 
so i probably ca n't . 
so i think that 's a start at least , going back to the basics in the early grades 
and that 's a big jump . 
i believe that . 
i did . 
through high school .
