the recycling program here is just terrible . 
it 's hard to find places to go . 
do they do newspapers ? 
i do n't know , 
i really do n't know what the details are . 
as a matter of fact , i 'm pretty sure there 's a place you can call and find out the closest thing to you , 
they pick up newspapers and milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans like soup comes in and stuff . 
they pick up everything . 
they all have shopping carts and stuff 
and they go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff , 
and so we used to just save them up 
and then they 'd come around 
and we 'd give them to them . 
during the winter time they move south or something 
so , i do n't do that anymore . 
i know it , 
i know it . 
they just overflow . 
it piles up . 
what 's a guy to do . i asked myself . 
i just do n't know . 
i just do n't know 
you ca n't really unload all your stuff . 
that 's true , 
had n't thought about that . 
that is very inconvenient . 
inconvenient , even . 
i know it , 
i know it . 
i 'm kind of bad about it . 
if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i 'll throw it in there , 
but i do n't ever take anything . 
you ought to , because the farmer 's market recycles absolutely everything . 
but wait 
i 've never seen you before . 
who are you ? 
my name 's bill . 
me , too . 
i just think that everybody ought to do it . 
do you know ? 
what about those grocery bags ? 
but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over . 
but , also most places big star does 
they 'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic . 
and they have little boxes that you can put your old bags in . 
can bring them in . 
those petroleum products are going to kill us . 
i know it , 
i know it . 
it really is a small , hostile planet . 
did you know that , 
really not . 
paper does n't seem threatening at all . 
it is , though . 
it comes from trees . 
how can it be bad ? 
they treat it with chemicals or something ? 
why ca n't trees break down ? 
i do n't get it . 
they do treat paper with chemicals 
you can bury a piece of yellow paper , 
it will still be there in a couple of weeks . 
it will be whole . 
you 'll be able to read off of it . 
i 'm glad you told me that , because i use those at work , where i work 
but i can just forget that from now on . 
i 'm going to switch to the white ones . 
white paper 's bad too . 
they treat it , too . 
i 'm sure that 's fine . 
i 'm sure . 
maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again . 
you think so ? 
maybe . 
tablets ? 
i think we should just abandon the written word altogether . 
you think ? 
i do n't know , 
what do you think ? 
everybody has a computer . 
kind of radical , i know 
we would no longer need paper at all . 
that 's true . 
i would love that .
