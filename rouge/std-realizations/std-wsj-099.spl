and work garden
it all
.
do you have a garden ?
try to grow a garden vegetable
the same thing
have just a small plot
it is ten feet by five feet .
, have two plots
ten one 's by ten
.
area more than
it 's all my backyard .
.
.
it is cheap entertainment .
get out in the open air
it is ,
that 's right .
but i i wish have sometimes more space .
go ahead .
of things , a lot of food
want to plant something , and sometimes
that 's right .
that 's right .
a lot of room .
and it takes up your whole space .
it sure does .
what that was a mistake .
they run just over
.
it was very good
a lot of your garden area , you say
the first and only time
we do n't do anything exotic
the basics
that are too
my wife used to plant a few peas snow .
really do n't care for snow peas
just a plants for herself
peas
a few peas out
you really did ?
,
.
until the warm weather enough to stick
you can get an earlier harvest by doing that ,
probably .
you can get a head start on it .
but a heck of a lot of work is sure .
,
watch them every day
'll do it again
is sure
.
from work
and and usually then go out and just walk around the yard and inspect it fiddle
you got to inspect it ,
and the kids , want to swing
them and on swing .
my own
and do n't have a sprinkler system
do n't
especially ,
we have a sprinkler system
and it 's nice really ,
it dragging hoses around
you and by the time you and that off about is up .
that 's right .
that 's right .
it 's nice really .
usually it started for my wife
she and move it ever around other day .
my own yard
do n't really enjoy doing that
enjoy having a nice looking yard ,
just do n't enjoy the work , that it takes to get it done
the real hot summer months until
my excuse for that
, so to have
have done it myself for
too much money but .
it is kind of expensive ,
it is .
of course , the chemicals when you buy them themselves , they 're too expensive .
but it is still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself .
that 's right .
really need get out and apply something ,
and the weed come , up
that 's right .
have and of all
that 's right .
's kind of bad about that
having a lawn service
have now , but the time
want to spend the money for it
get out in the morning before
that 's right .
can do it on any most days of the week
can start in the evening after work doing it when the days start getting
that 's right .
more an hour
rollback an hour
that is coming up pretty here soon .
it is this weekend ?
do n't know
it 's pretty soon .
really do n't know
it on the news the day before
think it is coming up here soon and
believe it 's too
you having any trouble with bugs in your garden
not a whole lot .
seldom use anything harsher than seven dust
really do n't like to put a lot on it chemicals
do n't want the bugs eating either it again , but then
they come in spurts
did n't put on anything
did n't have any problems and
covered just
did n't go out there for about three days
went out there
and the plant was
that 's right .
that quickly
really going
and , they have a good appetite , .
really .
like twenty of them off picked
and have been watching them every day
and have n't seen yet any signs
is going if
that a little bit different this year
it is kind like this shape box ,
other various things and
raised it up .
the good stuff .
are hoping especially with those tall big sides on there
'll at least
built a box
have
have
but you can improve your own soil there
that 's right ,
really .
you know .
that 's right .
n't
did it by hand ,
small enough ,
do just by hand it ?
it was n't too much of a job .
get one of these small little ones , that
it would be handy .
and or it weighs twenty pounds , something like that .
my neighbor across the street have one .
out there
it might be handy ,
have never seen one
have a friend that has one
it 's a fairly large to one , and
, just go to my garage and grab it if .
that would
that would be nice .
we have a garden for years , and years and years , of some size ,
ca n't remember a year when we did n't have one of some kind
what you got have growing right now ?
