, then
what do you think about it ?
think it 's a real good concept
drug testing procedures would have to be refined .
have seen on the news , there is
did n't realize that
up in their , test
but they did n't know for sure what it was ,
but it was a drug ,
they got so
people getting somebody and
that 's right ,
like a positive , negatives or some kind of word they use when
and then there 's an error every now
their rights and their rights
so
everyone coming
did three years ago
everyone goes through the drug testing procedure coming in
as for better and better
we did , in
if to continue to do once you 're in they
you 're always on called for it
they about a year and a half ago and instituted a , drug and testing alcohol program .
as each employee come in part of the hiring procedure is a test blood .
think , but the big problem is , though they send these large off to labs
and then they have thousands and thousands of samples going through it in a day
bottles and get up , things like that .
it 's a good idea ,
need the drug testing procedures
working for the company for
good company
and all that
that was a great place to work .
it 's good news .
in with them you can start buying stock
can a pretty fair amount of stock but
that 's what my brother was telling me .
that 's good deal .
have n't done in a couple months this
supposed to discuss
you are supposed to get five minutes .
we got a couple minutes , i guess , then more .
i think what else can say about that .
see 's
everyone coming in goes through the drug test .
what was you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through
me think about that
have already
you get
you come in the first , then
ca n't remember
already be working here in the first week of the drug test
maybe it was during the interview .
come up for an interview , a couple times
so it 's hard for me to remember
they wait for the drug test before you to come in
is so sure that happened to me , too
was there already working
they were n't and testing of those who were already working any .
