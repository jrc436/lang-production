what do you think is the worst culprit for air pollution ? 
i think it 's probably a combination of things . 
those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain , 
and i think that 's probably hurting us a little bit . 
hopefully we 're backing off from that a little bit , 
but i know we have n't cured it yet by a long shot . 
but it 's really bad on the environment . 
i guess i missed that one . 
automobiles of course are contributing , too , 
and , you know , how we are with our love affair with the auto 
kind of hard to do anything about that , i guess . 
i know , 
i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right , 
but they had a new policy where in order to get your car license , renewed , you had to meet the pollution standards 
we have that here , too , 
but it 's part of the inspection sticker , 
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe 
and so that 's the way they 're dealing with it here . 
i guess that was just mainly in the cities there , 
and as far as where i live , i do n't have to do that , 
and there 's no way i would put in a lot of money to repair it to meet standards . 
it 'd probably be difficult anyway . 
i was just reading an article in mother earth news magazine 
a lot of places are burning wood 
a lot of people are burning wood , 
i 've got a place in the country 
but they 've had up those for quite a while , 
it 's a catalytic converter , 
it 's a plate that fits into the smoke pipe 
and apparently it sort of feeds itself . 
after you get to like five hundred degrees , the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is . 
and it sounds real neat . 
i have n't seen them priced anywhere yet , 
that might help a little bit , especially in some places . 
we 're really lucky here . 
it depends , 
it comes back . 
i really think we 're doing some important things . 
education , raising consciousness awareness , 
i work for the school district here , 
and this is one of the big things with kids . 
kids are writing letters to the newspapers telling adults to clean up their act 
i hope we 're not too late with it . 
we 're having all kinds of recycling . 
that 's a big thing , too . 
i know it has nothing to do with air pollution ,
