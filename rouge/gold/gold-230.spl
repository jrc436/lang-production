i should not say i do not know . 
i do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed . 
and when difficult decisions are made they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on . 
i know in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code a unanimous verdict is not required . 
and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people , 
they are down to as small as six people in minor felonies and misdemeanor trials . 
but is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world ? 
if they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences , 
i think that is what is happening . 
i think the judges are trying to save the people from having , the cost of new prisons . 
that might be it . 
they are saying , the people can not afford it . 
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions prevail . 
plus , i guess , there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial . 
so 
you might be right about that . 
i do not know , 
it just seems to me that only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway . 
in the very end 
or less than half the cases that go to trial end up with the jury actually making the verdict . 
with a conviction ? 
that most of it is plea bargained half way through 
or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway . 
but how do you feel about the jury system itself ? 
do you think that should be changed ? 
i know one of my friends was brought up for jury duty . 
most of it was robberies or things like that , 
it was not any serious crimes . 
so apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person any felony . 
they give the person the option for a jury . 
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with the jury . 
but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in any sort of a case where damages are the result of some sort of an action that you are bringing against someone else . you can ask for that to be heard before a jury . 
takes a heck of a long time to get there in some states . 
i do not know , 
it is faced with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system . 
because everywhere i read that there is a shortage of judges . 
not that they wo n't appoint them 
but there is no budget for them , i guess . 
and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the court clerks . 
whatever . 
i do not think i would change it . 
i do not know what we would replace it with . 
i do not think i would either . 
i know , 
i can not think of the word i am looking for . 
anyway , the deterrent . for people to not commit the crime is sort of gone away . 
i do not know , 
they just do not care any more . 
and yet there are so many people in prison . 
my impression of it is that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty . 
i mean it , 
i guess our population has grown some too . 
but there definitely is to me one of the worst things that could ever happen from what i read and see and understand . 
i do no think i could handle prison . 
it would be very difficult , 
i would be interested in finding out what the percentage of drug related type things are , 
there must be a very great degree of that . 
but there again i do not know if the jury system itself comes in to play there . 
i would think that , 
of course it is a constitutional right that the press must have here , is the interviewing of jurors after the trial . 
it seems to me that when a jury makes a decision , they should not be asked before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision . 
i imagine there is a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that . 
i know , 
i was there during the trial actually , 
and the opposite was true of me . 
it was a picture is not good enough . 
we want to see , 
i do not know what they wanted honestly . 
i do not know . 
just because you feel like he was being kicked on , which he certainly was . 
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted . 
i felt that way . 
but it does not matter . 
the guy was obviously guilty . 
i always balanced in the situation . 
i remember the jurors , 
one count . 
but i do not know , 
maybe when you are there in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody . 
and the prosecutors do a lousy job , 
or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it . 
that might be it . 
i think i am getting a call coming in . 
nice talking with you . 
it has been nice talking to you . 
thank you .
