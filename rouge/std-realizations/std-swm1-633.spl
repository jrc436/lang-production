how do you feel about it ?
do n't see any problem with testing for random drugs
myself am in favor of it , almost .
and went through a , standard drug testing thing before
that 's
and that kind of thing , almost the goodness of character
where do you work ?
a policy for
if make they an offer , then .
on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of problem
and that happens definitely .
the drug tests they
but there 's always
and that 's something to be aware of .
's another thing .
they sensitive that
going to do about what that
they did n't catch that
they or else would
'm sure they screen for just a few particular types
with you
about five thousand drugs
do n't know
electrical
before they test you before you
, did the drug testing thing after that
through the general battery of all their tests
and then , they give you essentially the offer
'll at they and then
there 's so
's actually
probably .
what happens if you were to fail ?
they give you one more chance or two more chances
that 's a good question .
give you one more chance
they probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it .
accurate that once again , but not
people do fail
you working anywhere right now
in may be just about to finish my master 's
'm a doctoral student down there also
and they did , basically the exact same thing .
drug at the same time
we went through kind of an identical process .
do they test right now , at work , too , you ?
drug while you 're on the job
think the unwritten rule 's expect it ,
but they do n't do it .
that 's good i guess .
do n't know
of parties since that time a
while 've seen some people who work there and
and that 's the kind of thing that would definitely come up .
but
they really do n't do that .
might they test it formal policy they said
