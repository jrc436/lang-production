how old is she ?
she 's only about a little less than two years old .
you reached the stage where you need promote a college or anything

so we started saving ,
but that 's all .
you planning to encourage to go to a particular school your children
no particular school
going
they want to do
a big influence
what can afford , but what 's going to be best for you and not only
what it 's
where did you go to school ?
it was
it was , but not necessarily
it was between there and a private college was a bit more expensive choice .
not at the time , we could afford it really
ended up going there so although it was quite a drive away for me
enjoyed it
did you
it was a six hour drive .
when you said did not know that meant you have to drive an hour
it was like another world .
did not get home that often ,
and it 's kind of difficult sometimes at that age .
, especially if you have not been a lot away .
did you go straight out of high school there ?
did not get my degree until later on ,
of years a
it makes a lot easier your choices and when guess
that 's true .
went to get my master 's it on
was pretty much
was and
in of being able to have some latitude
the computer science
's

about three years .
work , somewhere else
sounds like you got your master 's before here
actually came from school
.
this was the first real job after getting my degree
after my master 's
.
my undergraduate degree was in what was my master 's not .

got my master 's at , which was a different school
and almost as well liked it
's not but
if , that 's fine ,
would get quite a break on tuition
because you went there .
did n't know that
certain schools
do this school .
and because it was kind of fun .
and there was a bunch of kids and a bunch of schools .
there was a hundred schools , probably all competing for the same kids there .
talk up your , school
your own school ,
by the number of kids who come by
may have until you start thinking about it
was and so
that worked out well so .
did you , then , drum up any interest
or that 's good .
think so .
but it seemed like there was quite a few kids that were interested in going there definitely .
one mother came by right , even before we started , which was obviously very interested in getting her daughter in having got or
some more information and .
and she was , letting us know how good her daughter was .
and she had these business cards she was passing out
and it was quite a production .
a little bit
