do you have any pets ? 
i have a dog and cat now . 
what are their names ? 
which is the dog 
and which is the cat ? 
and liberty is the cat . 
wife and i , we have two cats . 
one 's real nice , 
she 's pretty wild . 
. ours are pretty calm . 
are they just house pets ? 
that 's what ours are too . 
our cat we got from the pound the night she was going to be put to sleep . 
so that 's why we call her liberty . 
that 's a nice story . . 
do you want to hear about my other animals i 've had ? 
i 've had rats , 
i 've had mice 
let 's see , 
i had a son that was an animal lover . 
it was litter trained 
and we had it perfumed 
and it was very aggressive . 
nobody came near it when he was there . 
i had a dog one time , 
but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to back up and get ready . 
one other question we had is , why do you have pets ? 
why , i do n't know , 
i think they 're kind of nice to have , 
i do n't know , 
when they sit up on your lap and stuff like that , just kind of enjoyable to have , 
i do n't know , 
i always said if i died i 'd come back as a dog . 
what do you think ? 
that 'd be the best way to be . 
do you like big dogs or little dogs ? 
and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went . 
so , when he died , we got a little one . 
almost cruel for him to walk . 
he could n't get up , 
he could n't walk , 
he was a hundred and twenty pounds , 
so it was a chore . 
so we said the next time around we 'd get something little that if something happened , it would be easier to carry . 
and then we 've had three cats in our married life , 
do you ? 
she 's the nice one . 
we used to live in an apartment 
and our cats never went outside , 
but the neighbors used to let their dogs out , 
and our neighbors were kind of slimy , 
and our cats wound up getting fleas from the apartment that we were in 
so , we had to flea bath them 
and it was an experience that they did n't enjoy at all . 
do n't even talk to me , 
when i was single i had gone away for the weekend , 
and he let her out , 
and my house was loaded with fleas , 
you walked in 
and your legs were just black . 
and we had such a time , and never got the cat back . 
i found it in the street .
