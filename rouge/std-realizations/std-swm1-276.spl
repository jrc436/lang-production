i work quite a bit with
i look , and from more
they can find guilt or innocence
, too
should the jury
think the judges should ,
not knowing exactly from murder on up to tax stuff .
've been on a few juries
have been an expert witness some ,
so that it 's so hard to come up
and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is
two or three times
juries most might sit on three and over .
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime if they 're lucky that sometimes .
and they may have some different idea ,
it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was longer that the punishment did n't fit the crime .
or or not whatever the case may be long enough
the judges do have better knowledge of it
have a name , that 's the defendant and sometimes might have more pull , which do that happen , there
we ca n't say it does n't , because it does happen .
not everybody has the right morals sometimes .
whatever the case may be politically can
and that 's real not fair either , though sometimes
things that got me on the juries are in that often
often in the headlines
or get reduced in terms of sentences
and that makes the press never
gets as you or on a jury
and we do n't have , a lot of knowledge , again ,
really the range of
also be fair either
but , that does n't either make any sense to me .
and all this other stuff
like , they were
but then , to me , you should pay for what you did , when
and you should n't be able to go on the lesser charge .
do n't think that 's right , because all 's what 's going to do is to say
have the same thing
that 's not right .
that 's where the role of juries be restricted
'd want to change ,
is it be restricted in the sense
is if , it
with first degree
and you can decide guilt or innocence on that .
it 's what information
we call in a sense ,
they decide guilt or innocence
somebody think it had , because they 've got it there .
have all the information
do n't they ?
the oath 's tell the truth ,
they do n't want the whole truth .
part of it
different parts of the truth
that 's just like that game witness old ,
it 's a game kids play , too ,
somebody did it , but just for
there was four people ,
