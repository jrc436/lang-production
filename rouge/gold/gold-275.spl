there are certainly parts of town i would not want to live in . 
because it 's the situation 
it is very location dependent 
and we live right outside the city 
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people , though i 'm in graduate school , 
i live here because it 's close to the university . 
it 's really funny , 
the only crime we really see is just the kids being malicious . 
and i think most of that is because their parents are n't around . 
that make sense ? 
something like that . 
or fathers are just missing , 
so there 's no consistency there in the home or whatever . 
there 's no one to tell them what 's right and what 's wrong . 
sort of on my end is more of the upper middle class 
not that we do n't have a certain amount of local problems 
but on the other hand we get the affect of the city 
and the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes . a small number of assaults , 
and they are , unfortunately having murders at a rate greater than one a day . 
and they experience a lot more . 
i think they definitely have more problems in the area . 
what do you think can prevent crime ? 
but that 's which came first . 
basically the problem is in the society and the society 's views 
i think , i agree with you there . 
because it just was not something back in the sixties that i even had to worry about . 
but i think that there is a lot in the society where things have changed , 
i think the drug culture definitely is one of the main problems . 
that make sense ? 
he 's one of the big proponents of that . 
and he was a district attorney before , and a prosecutor before becoming mayor . 
it 's a different viewpoint . 
in a sense i have real mixed feelings on that 
it would certainly be an interesting test 
what happens if we lose worse . 
but the thing is , if somebody ruined their life society did n't try to then save themselves from it , 
they let this person who had ruined it die or whatever . 
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise , we need to take care of people even if they have physically ruined themselves . 
they have induced it themselves . 
that 's true . 
i would certainly like to see a real test of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then do n't use them . 
but i never heard results or anything like that , 
but that was interesting , 
i do n't know , 
the drug culture , 
i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things , not thinking anything wrong with it . 
and , of course , i 'm a baby of the old school 
but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality . 
that 's true . 
that 's true . 
we worked hard for everything . 
that 's very true . 
but nowadays , there 's so much on tv where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing . 
of course i work for lawyers a lot 
and drunk driving is a good one , 
and 
if you 're going to drink you better have your designated driver . 
in this country , and for example with alcohol or with drugs we do n't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say it is okay under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme . 
and we mean it . 
i think that , the drunk driving has actually , just caught on . 
my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school 
and that was an awful three years afterwards of recovery and the difficulties and everything we did 
his father was even , the police chief of the town . 
but he was uninsured . 
so our insurance paid for everything , 
but it was a very difficult time 
and then later my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a new car 
and they came and questioned us . 
it was an acceptable social behavior . 
very much so . 
those are some important points . 
what does your city have for gun control if anything ?
