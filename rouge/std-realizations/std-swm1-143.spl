or public service commitment
is it
heard too much about it
up when was there so much controversy about reviving a draft
have to provide military service to the country ,
an awful lot of young people who would benefit from some sort of public service , like the conservation back in the thirties or various other things of that sort
and it seems to me that it 's not a totally bad idea ,
do n't see how they 'd make it work quite but
my first impression was it would be very good .
think it would be good for people to serve ,
do n't know if it should be an option but
it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that was during the depression , or coming out of the depression available for kids .
they able to work
and some people would get military service
and some people would get civilian service , like working in hospitals .
do hospital service or things like that
farm work in
there 's justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
it 's a possibility .
rather war work in a hospital than to go
'm sure that most young men and women would and
it was something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life .
that makes sense .
and then you run into the bureaucracy in running it .
you going to cover that many people
because we 've got a lot more people now than then we did
and we have in addition to that
even if , you have to pay them something .
plus .
that would be in most cases expensive .
and it did really seem to be a worthwhile organization ,
but on the other hand is not sure what the permanent value of it was
do n't know what we got for all the money ,
but do n't know how to cope with their lives better if they have really significant effects in the places where they went , in teaching the people
was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me and
doing it in different situation not a really religious background , if
did because it emphasized that sort of thing
a lot of self evaluation
and it was voluntary definitely , too .
and not
'm sure that would make too , and
what about a voluntary program ?
do you think that would be a good idea ?
go and do work in the national parks and working in neighborhoods to clean
what it is organization under
if it 's a charity private that 's put it together or it 's a government running
n't either
the ones
forestry work and .
they
and they put up
fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort and .
's and
but there may be other things .
'm not so sure
, it 'll do them in the long run
it 's probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble ,
but whether it 's something that they can put to economic use are later on
'm from the inner city
back to the inner city , if they may not see , much less be able to take care of them .
that 's true .
point good
so that may not benefit in the long run them .
's
're going to have to go ,
's my other line
thank you .
but it was good to talk to you .
too
