i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows 
and the other one is night court . 
and i think they 're real different 
i do n't think they have anything in common , 
but mostly it 's kind of science fiction , 
and it 's adventure and things like that 
and then night court is just pure weird fun , 
it 's nothing serious about it at all . 
so , i do n't know why the two of them happen , to be my two favorite shows , 
but that 's the way it is , 
it 's funny that those are my husband 's two favorite shows , too , 
and i enjoy watching both of them , 
but i used to did n't like night court 
and the only reason i think i like it now is because i 've seen it so much 
and i 'm involved with the characters , 
he is . 
and i told my husband , that 's the whole point , 
that 's right , 
i find him degrading at times . 
i guess that is the point , 
they really have changed him though . 
if you 've watched it this season he still is in his own way degrading and everything , 
but he 's involved in that charity , 
in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some beautiful woman just because his mind was on the ozone layer and global warming and all this other kind of stuff . 
so that was part of his character building or whatever , 
i think it probably adds a little bit of depth to his character . 
which of course he needed . 
i think so , 
even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see a real person in those situations . 
he 's doing amazing things 
but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do 
that 's a good point , 
i like that . 
what do you consider your favorite shows ? 
i think my favorite show is hunter . 
i agree . 
and then the blond that they took out , the one that got killed 
i ca n't remember what her name is , 
i did n't enjoy her . 
and i think that 's what they try to do , 
and they say that there was a conflict between her and him that they never really could get her into any character that they could use . 
the second lady ? 
the second one the blond 
they did n't . 
they were never partners . 
she would go her way , 
and he would do his , 
and i think that 's what i did n't like . 
but it seemed like it was almost two different organizations , 
hunter was the boss , 
and this other girl was not , 
and you 're wondering , when did this happen ? 
so 
i kind of agree with that . 
and i like the new lady better , 
but i 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there . 
i 'd just as soon have the police story without all the romance . 
i 'm afraid that 's what they really wanted to do , 
i think most shows were doing that , 
and then they went away from it 
and now they 're starting to go back to it , 
and maybe that 's what the public wants , 
i do n't know , 
but i like the cut and dry solve the mystery , 
and that 's what i always enjoyed about it . 
but they started it , 
and then they 'd pull it back , 
and they 'd start it and pull it back . 
and that really made it a very interesting show to where you never really knew which one was going to show up whether it was going to , where they 're going to be real close or whether they 're just going to be partners 
and , that i kind of thought was good , 
you always kind of sit there 
and you see these two people together , 
and you always wonder , why they do n't get together or whatever . 
and so i guess that 's what they decide to do 
just go ahead and quit the wondering 
maybe it 's not a good example . 
the last day , all they did was the last season , to where the two of them got married 
and that was the killer , 
i was going to say , i did n't ever watch moonlighting , 
go ahead . 
but i heard that 's what killed it 
same thing . 
and so the show died . 
it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they get married , 
the minute they get married , everything 's supposed to be cut and dried 
and , of course , another one of their mistakes is they have a tendency to change characters , or to change the characters ' personalities especially after they get married . 
why would they do that ? 
it made no sense . 
unfortunately , that 's probably true . 
like in the big soap opera shows , which i do n't enjoy because of that , 
do you watch who 's the boss ? 
i 've seen it before , 
but i do n't watch it regularly . 
i hardly ever watch it , 
but , as i 've seen it , they 've done sort of the same thing to where they started to let them get together , 
and then they pulled them apart 
and i think they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about . 
so . i always thought that was kind of weird . 
but when he gets married , then you do n't care any more or something like that , 
probably , 
i know it affected me when i was younger . 
i 'm not into rock stars too much lately , 
i do n't particularly like either one of them 
but their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together 
or at least , that 's the way i look at it . 
so i do n't know , 
it would have been hard , would n't it . 
i would think so . 
when you get married you 've got relationship to develop in the first place , 
they would n't be easy . 
that 's kind of interesting . 
i guess that 's about all we need to do , is n't it . 
i think we 've covered our time . 
it 's been good talking to you . 
i really appreciate it . 
you 're the first man i 've talked to , 
everyone else has been a female , 
so this is a change . 
you 're the second female i 've talked to . 
you 've had a little bit of variety . 
it 's kind of nice . 
thanks so much .
