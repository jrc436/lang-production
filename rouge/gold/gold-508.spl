pretty good , 
pretty good . 
we 're talking about drug testing in the work place . 
drug testing in the work place . 
. i 've been tested a few times , just before employment . 
but that 's about it . 
i 've never had random drug testing . 
we have random drug testing in my business , 
but i 've never had to do it . 
they started that about a year ago , 
and i think it 's mostly for the field people that drive trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff . 
but they have done some testing around our office , mostly after lunch , looking for people drinking beer and stuff at lunch time , 
they do with alcohol . 
they do it with alcohol ? 
they 'll check for alcohol . 
once you start doing that stuff , you 're sort of stuck into checking for the whole thing . 
. that 's interesting . 
what type of field of work are you in ? 
i 'm in the oil business . 
in the oil business . 
i work in the office , 
so it 's pretty safe environment . 
i work in the automotive air bag industry , where we make the safety bags for the cars , 
and we work around a lot of explosives . 
that sounds like kind of an important job to be straight on . 
i 'm all for it , because the type of environment i work in they 're working with explosives , 
they have safety features with each of the explosives they use , 
but still , it can be dangerous . 
i agree . 
i think that under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working in high risk industries , where you can really hurt other people , that you need to have that kind of stuff . 
as long as it 's not abused random , 
as long as it 's random , and the individual 's rights are protected , i do n't have that big a problem with it . 
do they fire them , 
this is it , 
this is where i start having my problems with my company . 
i work for a private company , 
and the policy is something like if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem , then you 're eligible for company counseling . 
but if they catch you , if you test positive for a controlled substance , then you get fired . 
it 's probably the same thing . 
it 's one of those things that you read once , 
and then , if you 're not worried about it , you just forget about it . 
that 's right . 
but i know , they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance , 
but i 'm not sure if it 's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in . 
our company 's a little tougher on the second chance . 
if they 're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in , then they ought to go out of the way a little bit more to help get you rehabilitated to get back at your job . 
but when you 're a private company , the rules do n't always apply . 
it 's hard for me to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment 
i guess i have n't run into anybody that 's been a problem . 
so i guess it works much like any lottery , 
everybody 's got an equal chance to get picked . 
you could time it just right . 
i know one employee , i know , when i was working with , he had alcohol on his breath , 
and i 'm not sure if our policy covers that or not . 
that 'd be just as dangerous . 
especially around equipment , machinery and stuff . 
. that 's true . 
i 've gone out and had a beer at lunch time , but not to excess in any case . 
do they give any limits on alcohol , 
i do n't remember , to tell you the truth . 
i do n't think they do . 
they must , 
that just shows you how much i 've been paying attention , 
because i really do n't know . 
i 'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask . 
you can take some of that testing a little bit too far . 
it was not only drugs ,
