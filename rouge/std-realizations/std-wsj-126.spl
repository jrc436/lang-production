is in favor of it all ,
doing a pretty good job on us not taking advantage of the financial dependence most of the countries have
direct even more than we 've been
do n't think we 've been doing too bad
do you think that 's right ?
think , we should ?
that money is just power ,
it 's like his , mother came over
about our intervention , and their government and stuff like that
and he was
the kind of control that is bad ,
their governments corrupt so
they should work their way , ,
they should be able to work their self out of it
in another country 's problems and things
the ones have to do it and things like that
if that influence will affect our country too for one
and for two that it does help .
the people do want our help in those country
we did n't have to
, as long at least , it is their choice
it 's a government that stays in power , which can stay in power ,
it seems , but
out of agreements with certain leaders
aids and stuff government or
think that , has a lot of things to
i
down or not
was they
so do n't know really what 's going to happen
but we 're not intervening in that ,
put it this way ,
thought
and we 're
with that
stand up
this is ridiculous
with these kind of conditions in a world who are advancing as fast as it is
, we do n't want anywhere of this
in a way
think a religion has a lot to do with that sometimes
it was around the other way .
a lot of the rules
the ones , do keep the people down
people in sort of line
do n't understand quite that
even understand what
which is now it that way not
actually
did n't understand though they still
up for their rights as much
do n't think
really never thought , it that way of
are
speak so , for their rights
, do n't know
could be the economic still .
do n't agree with that ,
, do n't agree
a lot more chances
they are
so , what 's the difference ?
thought
think communications does have a lot to do with it in education , maybe
do n't know about education
because the black community is
think it 's communications , so
think it had a lot to do with education maybe
that 's true .
that 's good , in a way .
with something
rate literacy gone down
in our country ?
in our country ,
good education is still really free .
though just good education , is that it .
it 's good education ?
it may be free
but it good education 's
that 's just it and
are we willing to pay for it ,
people and about the taxes and all
they to , pay for quality education
higher degrees than
so , you 're going to have to expect it .
some of that money out of your pocket
so do n't know
