we are supposed to discuss the school system
that should n't be too much trouble for the two of us .
as many years as we
in , even though that
some major problems with dropouts but from talking .
they did n't even show up for class and sometimes
and they did n't just
that are really sad
they do n't even come
just working in high school that students and recently .
for , but that was very possible handling a job , and it seemed to have other factors .
think so too .
their plans after high school
what 's and their home situation .
is the home
the main goal is making money now and
and it may be a thing for the family , when you can understand survival .
this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now ,
but that the most important thing is still getting your education .
your education .
when they said , my first impulse was it is n't really what is wrong with the public schools
it is what is wrong with families .
that 's right .
it is what is wrong with families
they do n't know what to expect at home .
they do n't feel secure there ,
of their apartment complex
was for example that child
how they can concentrate on schooling ?
with you
think that 's the main problem
educate the kids and try to provide them with some security
and that 's
at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids
last year and was the first year that we had ever more than one counselor .
and that is really just not enough .
it is n't .
somebody who in a middle school teaches to
said they at a tougher and rougher age and all that and
there be a counselor at least
and we have recently at just a counselor .
we did n't even
had three at middle schools , though , because we have a thousand about kids
they between three counselors up and
for every year but they 'd have a different counselor
and they decided that did n't work .
here .
more security in
if they have a rapport with their counselor .
hope they have the flexibility to be able to change
to change
and that happens occasionally .
but , it 's frightening
because , 's education
it 's certainly .
getting their education , for one reason or another ,
that 's right .
what 's going to happen to them ?
they going to be the thieves and the people in prison
faster then we can build up
that 's no good .
is on for my school that campus strategic planning committee
they have all these different names for things , strategies and all these different things .
one of the key things were anyway , but we believed the public education is the best economic value
then think they decided to strike economic
anyway , is what happens when public education fail ?
then people will go to private schools ?
what kind of a situation
we and in to private schools
think one thing that we 'll see is that we wo n't be educating everybody
the things that
we try to educate everyone .
that 's right .
that 's right .
we are only in the world do the country .
higher willing to work and have some ability if they are
they can do that .
believe it 's something like that ,
it is worded .
and do n't know
that is so important ,
then that helped a lot .
think the gang violence are scaring everyone to death too
it 's scary .
really a frightening situation
in situations and schools to be where to do n't see that we .
my mother was teacher for years , and years
and they are talking a lot about the situation school there , too .
shall up
the amount of time necessary
we have to
'll so
was n't at church
how exciting
that are n't
is that
what an experience .
