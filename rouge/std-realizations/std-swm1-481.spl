this is an unusual topic .
what do you think about it ?
it took eight times to find
should say
and then he reminded me ,
just so and they
just a small , dinner type thing and then at a park or something to have .
how do they come ?
and sometimes we 've gone
and his dad 's family 's all around the area
they have everybody and each time .
that makes sense .
nobody 's out of a lot of trouble more than once .
and that person can call beforehand and just make sure that everyone know , too .
and then they just sort of do a little program or something like that so
that 's interesting .
you sound like you have a lot of experience with this , then
that 's
have to either or
and we 're all there
a , orange county area
mostly not than an hour away
.
of the family my mother 's
years ago there was
they have a reunion since then
and all that
summer we have
in from out of town
and they had some activity ,
and all of that stuff
about various parts of the family tree
a lot of that sort of thing and
you could do that once since .
next time we have one , we 'll have to think of something more creative to do .
and everyone 's just very interested inevitably
and they always have two or three new ones to add to the list ,
someone 's been born
or someone passed away
something like that or
or little
compared to my mother-in-law not very much
not a passion
we will do more of it
about some of the relatives
a lot of
they 're really kind of fascinating .
my grandmother was
virtually no background on
'm sure she 's dead now , because my grandmother died about twenty years ago
.
's probably
maybe they just moved away and then
do n't know
