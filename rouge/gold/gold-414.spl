how do you feel about capital punishment ? 
i 'm not certain that it does a lot of good that it ends up effectively avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment penalties . 
yet , on the other hand i do n't know , 
seems like it 's the right thing to do . 
i do n't know . 
what about yourself ? 
i have the same dilemma , i think . 
it seems right sometimes 
and then other times , you do n't know . 
and they 're extremely severe . 
i think to a certain degree , the reason that it does n't serve as a deterrent may be because you never know if it 's going to be applied . 
and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand 
and everybody knows exactly what for . 
or there is a good chance you 're going to get off . 
and also , it does n't seem like it does that many harm , 
their life is taken , 
but they 'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway , 
so i think sometimes they 'd prefer just to get it over with 
so it 's more of the easy way out than making them pay for what they 've done . 
except that the average cost to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is extremely high something , i was amazed at . per year , 
it 's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year . to keep people in jail . 
and it 's sort of a crass perspective on the usage of capital punishment , 
but on the other hand i do n't know if that is that serious that they 're really never going to be out of jail , 
but then again , also , you ca n't bring back lives that have been taken anyway , 
i do n't know , 
i know , 
taking one more life does n't get things back the way they were . 
i do n't know , 
i really do n't know , 
what state are you in ? 
where are you calling from ? 
i see , 
i guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment . 
it 's one of the quickest , 
i think it was outlawed for a while by the supreme court or , the interpretation of the constitution 
and it seems like everybody stopped 
they do it by lethal injection . 
and there they do it by hanging . 
i still remember the movie in cold blood . 
i 'm sure you 're familiar with it , 
but , have you seen the movie ? 
i have n't , 
that way . 
and they do it that way ? 
they show it , 
and so it 's not particularly graphic , 
it 's kind of a barn like structure . 
i think they 're there , 
i 'm not really familiar . 
is that right ? 
are you there in school ? 
i am . 
a long time ago , i remember my dad was telling me this that they do it by a bunch of men have guns 
and one of them has the real gun in it . 
has a real bullets 
i know that . 
i know . 
as long as you 're sort of safely removed from it , it seems not so bad , i guess .
