they tell you what our topic was ? 
i think golf , is n't it ? 
are you a hacker ? 
you bet . 
i 've been a hacker , 
i know i did , 
i know i did . 
and it 's like they do n't have a muscle in their body . 
i know , 
if i play a lot of golf , i play six to eight times a year 
and that 's about it . 
i figure that 's my retirement game . 
i come from a family of golfers . 
that was their deal , 
that 's what it takes , 
you need to play that often to get a really good handicap . 
but i just never could do it . 
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf 
i decided this past year that i was going to get out and start playing a lot more 
and i went after it 
and and i really did n't find much improvement . 
fact , ever time i 'd start trying to correct something , it seemed like the score would go back up , 
i probably need to take some more lessons and practice more often . 
i think i 'm probably the same way . 
lessons do help . 
i go to this ducks unlimited dinner , 
it 's a hunter 's type affair 
i 'm familiar with it . 
and we just have a ball , 
and we play three days in a row , three different courses 
and , course by the end of the third day and the end of the third course , my score has gone from a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five . 
if you play regular , i think it makes a big difference . 
you bet , 
so that makes a lot of difference to me . 
i try to work out regularly 
and when i am doing that and feeling loose and , that i swing better , 
i get through the ball better . 
i found as i 've gotten a little older here , i worry less about my distance . 
you bet . 
my control is a little bit better there . 
that 's super . 
i have n't learned to hit the ball easy 
i 'm always wanting to hit it hard 
and subsequently when i do tire out from playing like twelve , fourteen holes , a lot of my energy 's gone , 
when i do swing it 's an easier swing 
and i do , actually , hit the ball better . 
have you ever tried a one iron ? 
i have a two through wedge . 
i hit a two iron awful lot . 
off the tee . i do n't hit a driver off the tee . 
that 's why i need my driving lessons . 
i put mine back in my bag this year , too , 
and i used a three wood rather than a driver . 
that helps . 
i had a lot more control on it , 
but i was n't in trouble every time i got down the fairway . 
that 's a good idea . 
i think this next year , i 'm going to attempt to play more 
and i 'm going to do the same thing . 
i laid off my woods about three years ago 
and i just use a two wood off the fairway 
and i 'm a fairly strong person 
so i get a pretty good little drive 
and and i guess control my irons , better , 
if you 'll take lessons , the first thing they put in your hand is an iron . 
and i still remember that watching myself and my son 
but i think the key is you need to play more often than i play . 
i think there is less frustration factor there , too , 
makes good sense . 
the one iron is something i 've been thinking because my driver 's gone so badly lately that i should pick one up and try to start . 
apparently they 're very difficult to play with , 
and i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron , 
it 's incredible . 
and his accuracy is what 's so startling with it . 
but it 's an iron that he 's really practiced with . 
he has used , 
and it would be fun to get that good with uh , distance iron . 
you bet . 
if i can get off the first tee when everyone 's standing around watching you , i 'd be , great after that . 
and get away without embarrassing yourself ,
