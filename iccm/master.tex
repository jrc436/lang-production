\begin{abstract}
Our goal was to compare among different starting points in the process of language production. We accomplished this by building a model of language production that takes as input a set of words and attempts to construct a grammatical sentence from them. We pre-biased the model's initial utilities to start in the middle, beginning, and end of the sentence in order to add evidence to the debate of how incremental language production is. [Insert findings here]  Language production is an interesting process that is difficult to examine with traditional means.
