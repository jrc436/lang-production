all set , then . 
what do you think about it ? 
i think it 's a real good concept . 
drug testing procedures would have to be refined . 
from what i 've seen on the news , there 's a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy , poor procedure in drug testing . 
i did n't realize that . 
there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their , test , 
but they did n't know for sure what it was , 
but it was a drug , 
so they got turned down 
and turns out it was a prescription . or people getting somebody else 's blood test . 
that 's right , 
i do n't remember what they call it , sort of like a positive , negatives or some kind of word they use when you get a positive indication of drugs , but there were n't really any there . 
every now and then there 's an error 
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated . 
so do we , 
everyone coming in . 
i guess i did three years ago . 
everyone coming in goes through the drug testing procedure 
and they talk about it as better for the country and better for the working conditions . 
i know we did in the military , 
but i do n't know if once you 're in they continue to do it , 
but i guess you 're always on call for it . 
and about a year and a half ago they instituted a , drug and alcohol testing program . 
as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a blood test . 
but i think the big problem , though , is they send these off to large labs 
and then they have thousands and thousands of samples going through it in a day 
and bottles get mixed up , things like that . 
it 's a good idea , 
but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better . 
then he 's been working for the company for a while , too . 
good company 
he 's telling me about good profit sharing and all that , 
that was a great place to work . 
it 's good news . 
two or three years in with them you can start buying stock 
but you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while . 
that 's what my brother was telling me . 
that 's good deal . 
i have n't done this in a couple months . 
how long were we supposed to discuss for ? 
you 're supposed to get five minutes . 
we got a couple more minutes then , i guess . 
think what else i can say about that . 
let 's see , 
everyone coming in goes through the drug test . 
were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through 
let me think about that . 
it was after , i had already been hired . 
you get hired , 
then you come in the first , 
i ca n't remember . 
that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test . 
maybe it was during the interview . 
i came up a couple times for an interview , 
so it 's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened . 
they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment , 
so i 'm sure that happened to me , too . 
, it was after i was already working there 
and they were n't testing any of those who were already working .
