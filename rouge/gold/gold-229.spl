i have probably had more time than you have to think about this subject , 
so i 'll tell you , 
is it a serious problem ? 
i do believe it 's a serious problem . 
however , there are solutions to it . 
if a third of the people are shift workers , they wo n't be able to get to the polls in any case . if they have to work late into the evening and not get up . 
they hold it on the weekends ? 
but that is one of my solutions . 
and i do not think they have seen a really high improvement . 
i always vote . 
and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot . 
i do not say that it is that complicated , 
so registrations are perhaps a problem also . 
and we 're the mobile society , 
one out of every seven people moves every year . 
but i do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place , who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard . 
i think that is the biggest one . 
that 's the biggest problem . 
i , just read two books , 
one of them is whose stars and stripes now ? 
it 's a fairly decent book . 
it 's preceded by several other books by these guys . 
and i forget what the other books were , 
in any case , they say that there 's a definite trend toward candidates using negative voting . 
it is the only way that you can use television effectively . 
i do n't understand that . 
is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public ? 
the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than a positive factor . 
if you go on the attack , and put some sensational thing before the public and it is not refuted , people will believe it . 
if you do n't refute it , as he did n't , there must be some truth to the matter . 
he did refute it . 
he refuted it , 
he did n't believe anybody would believe that . 
and indeed his trend started upward . 
i did n't believe anybody would believe that either . 
they do . 
then how can a democracy work then ? 
i do n't know . 
how can it work ? 
is it working ? 
that 's the question . 
everybody seems disappointed , 
my solution to part of this is to make it an economic incentive for people to vote . 
what ? 
you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever . 
how about the reverse of that ? 
what if we just severely limited the campaigns so money was n't so much of an issue ? 
i feel like , , if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count . 
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls , 
, i do n't care how easy it is for them , 
i do not think they are going to because they do no think that anybody listens to their vote . 
and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance . 
you mean the special interest groups ? 
they do not promise anything specific these days . 
but whatever you are promised , they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office . 
read my lips . 
and no new taxes 
but he 's excused from that . 
i 've read polls now where they 've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget . 
then why did he say that during his campaign ? 
he promised the best he could . 
and he is the president 
and he should address those problems 
what was so funny about it is that it happened so rapidly . 
he knew it . 
he actually knew it . 
and being associated with government , he should be held up to the light for that . 
and maybe he will . 
and he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that . 
i think voters are motivated ... 
what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about ? 
because it 's going to be totally different , 
you do not think so ? 
just , it got more violent every year . 
but , simply because people were so concerned about their inability that their vote does not count any way . 
now everybody is available . 
i see , 
were disqualified . 
or is that just the truth ? 
i think there 's a higher percentage in certain black areas of voters . 
i think in this sort of conversation we can only do our own reaction . 
they have this huge fight going over redistricting here . 
and at one point they took another vote on it , 
and the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to pass their plan . 
and this is something that had been going on for months . 
it was on the news every night . 
and they have had lawsuits over it . 
it was a major issue , 
and there still was n't enough minority vote to pass the plan that they were backing . 
i think that you have really hit on something there . 
what do you mean ? 
why , 
did you not press one ? 
i did press one , 
but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up .
