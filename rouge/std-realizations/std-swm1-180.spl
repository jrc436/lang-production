what type of music do you like ?
like , and sort of rock type popular music
too
had never really
my wife and enjoy it .
have never so
whenever she does
it and even put on myself .
used to play the piano ,
those really nice
like
do n't know myself all that much ,
just know , when
you like .
how about popular music ?
a hard time clearly hearing the words if
's pretty much the same way
know
know ,
know
can remember after the song 's over
it two or three times
's the same way
it 's
and the difference in the radio with popular music , is totally different ,
so , it was sort of a funny thing .
there 's a big variation among the country ,
're starting to realize that
never really thought about that much ,
but there is .
moved to this area
did n't really
it just seemed
but it really changed when .
does it ?
you do n't have to wait till the hour mark .
it 's sort of constant .
you just turn there ,
the latest news and everything and .
and it 's on .
that would really be beneficial .
so .
the news basically on the radio
never get
behind if you 're in , all the time the car if
that 's pretty good .
like to listen to tapes of music , on a long trip stuff
and now you can even get books on tape .
my grandmother on fact do , because she , 's blind
or she is .
can imagine if you 're driving cross country listening to a story
lot of the classics
so , that 's a lot of fun
that would be good .
guess so .
music comes into that whole aspect of listening
we can just cut off
it was
good luck ,
and you make some more calls
thank you .
