you do
subscribe to any magazines at home
.
of course , anything that appeals to the homemaker since that 's my main line of interest .
a working woman or something back to work and
of course , is one of those who do things at once two ,
kind of and
and then you stopped them all .
but
the subscriptions ran out
renewed them and never
time at home since i work , read them and .
get of and then turned off by it
for that kind of sets
so many things that
travel and we
on in the various different ones travel parts
, and get
that kind of tell you
put down
might then read something , and if something caught my eye
otherwise they were not useful to me , too , but
is that
got some good recipes from them , sometimes
recipes
and you save them forever
and you never really use them .
that 's right ,
that 's right .
every so often and then
did put that recipe ever
but that 's my on short subject reading and things like this whole idea mainly .
, like i
on the newsstands or something like that while that new magazine and in a
have since i work with computers during my work to keep up on the new computer equipment and software and everything all
be a very long time , probably , before
know if you 're in public transportation sometimes will people read them on something like that
dump them at
and do n't have to carry them back with me
that 's right .
that when
no matter what it 's
air travel or anything
that 's when you 've really time .
somewhat got into computer work ,
we have our own computer system at home
would get more from it
and it was
a little bit more than
did so never get into them
was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail when
, we have a live one
'll
but they were wrong .
never got into them
our conversation at
it was nice talking .
talk with you , too
thank you .
