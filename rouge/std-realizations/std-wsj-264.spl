think is the biggest problem ?
the biggest problem in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools that you can throw money at it ,
, do n't know
the schools reflecting society in a bigger way
or the values they get from home
it 's a lot more ,
it is socially unacceptable ,
a lot more emphasis on athletics
thought that carries over to a lot school and
thinks the biggest problem is with the home environment being part of it
while teach the moral aspects of things to the kids
you 're not going to do that ,
you 're going to carry out into the world you learned to school at home ,
think that part of that
part of
and is part of it
drugs , is now a big problem
think that 's another problem root and
i wonder if that 's a problem root or not ,
think a lot about that ,
it 's just like on drugs now
but i wonder ,
kind of
, of course they 're doing better ,
but because they still have a better success rate .
it is the socioeconomic mix
that way they are not all , and
to the inner city public schools
actually was this
was people
just because their kids have the ability and the drive that they did n't send him to a public school ,
learn in instance not
in a lot of cases like that , if , because it is .
think it shows the parents , have some desire for the kid to do well
that may be passed on down to the kid as well , and
maybe they and pick up on that .
do a good job because the classes , may be smaller
they may be able to give the resources that are needed to do a good job .
i
what would you do to fix the school systems and ?
that 's a tough question how to fix the school system .
at home and respect for other people
think that 's a big part of it
if you 're not going to care about learning ,
you 're not going to really care about yourself .
was going to say
it is the chicken , and the egg thing .
i wonder ,
be in high school
in school grade
when they 're doing that goes through
but that 's not an easy task ,
it 's a tough question
kind up in a home that may be just the pits ,
any kind of a good environment to live in
care of other people 's stuff
could see where that would be a problem ,
