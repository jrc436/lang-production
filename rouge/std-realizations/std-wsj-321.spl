why you do n't go ahead and say
'll respond and then
very guilty of doing not my part with recycling
and it was very easy to put out there everything ,
we do n't have at least in our neighborhood right now , but it
to take the effort
how long have you been here ?
feel so , still
but it is working up to a year now ,
think that 's a good excuse
to get into the system , a little more
we 've been here probably two and a half years ,
think so we 're doing well
right now we save most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper .
where do you take those things ?
them in for money and usually then save our cans up
where do you do that
because we 've been saving cans for my daughter 's choir ,
did n't them but
think there 's a station there service
they worth much right now
but it is better than nothing ,
better than
do now have a lot of neighborhoods ,
hearing that it is coming
it is
read in the mail that we get
, and ca n't wait for that
that will be easy .
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off ,
a lot of
the whole garbage kitchen
'll start doing , too
it was really ,
it was just no effort at all no trouble more than taking the garbage out ,
salad bottles and things like that
it 's not of a deal that big ,
and it 's just to throw them out
do or two
how much , do you earn on the cans
maybe a grocery sack full or maybe two sacks full grocery
and it would be two dollars
but since last time we 've gotten more like a dollar .
so it 's gone down .
which is understandable ,
more people
, we used to take out for a bike ride the boys and pick up the litter
that was kind of fun , and
but we have n't done for a long time that
that sounds like a pretty good project .
the boys think it is fun ,
plus you get
you do and
'll have to keep myself and get on it
my neighbor across the street , is so careful
keep telling myself
but , maybe they 'll beat me and do .
that will spur on you , and
wo n't have any excuse then ,
that 's for sure .
thinking about it , anyway
that 's all you can do
do they this thing for us time ,
or , do we
do , as long as it
if it 's been long enough ,
five minutes are when .
you ca n't
it was good talking to you ,
maybe we 'll get again on line and .
