my mind went when kind of blank .
n't have taken anything back for a long time
have n't either ,
returning things
and take everything back again
it 's a game to her ,
do like to do that , but not
consider it kind of a waste of my time
's usually pretty careful so
things over if it 's an appliance or something to make sure that it has the features in it
had it for
it just was n't working ,
missing from it and .
my husband opened up it
and of course we do n't have any more ,
so we ca n't take back it .
of course ,
a lot of goods
get you just by five years
throw it away rather than
we 're a wasteful society , for sure .
that 's true ,
usually for you and get .
and they were ten dollars ,
nice work for the little kids
and they did n't work worth anything .
we took those back ,
and that 's about that
all that was taken back in ages .
you know pretty well ahead of time ,
and if you buy a good one , you should n't have too much of a problem with it ,
it 's hard .
and the car would go
and it would stop
and with the manufacturer and everything
, it seems like ,
, and still do n't have
they know when it 's old they 're going to buy ,
think that 's true ,
now , a warranty and at least should go wrong with it .
my husband is really good at fixing things , too ,
usually so
do n't know if they 're making them better or not ,
it 's hard to say .
make
think the technology is better but
think technology is better ,
'm not sure
got
about
do n't
everything is
an awful lot of things
that 's true .
so , if .
sell stuff at shows
