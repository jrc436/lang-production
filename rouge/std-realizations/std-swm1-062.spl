the question was
just read
with two little kids can understand that
is that simple .
to escape
and do
just finished one last night
a great book .
, it 's very a typical for my reading , though ,
strange book
by somebody that was there
a guy that was there as a soldier foot
can imagine
what 's the latest one
, to tell what
'm trying to think back now ,
an awful lot of periodicals and almost what you call reference books
have similar problems
as a matter of fact ,
finished one ,
think two years ago
and did n't do that much for me
but the period of time was fascinating .
was it battle cry of freedom ,
think it was battle cry of freedom
cry of freedom .
and it 's not a story of the civil war ,
to the events that brought about the civil war that
there was a lot more to than that it
there was a lot more to it than that .
it was a political move .
really surprised me
and are not
've got the same problem
that way you put
all this civil war pride and
is n't much there , there were ?
well they have not even been there .
they were n't
and the only way that they have any part in it was after
, keep telling that my husband and
and he , keep saying .
,
and they have an interesting time there .
'll bet they did
ca n't think of the guy 's name
, why they actually held them off
that , could be it .
you did n't
and they did n't get across the river there
and that was actually after the war was over
and they won the whole thing
that 's
that 's
if corn did n't grow there , and it did n't matter .
so what does that make me ,
is she then
of those kind of things that the other thing
kind of it
read a lot more than
get out two or three books
read all four of them
and understand
he 's been on the road a lot in the last six weeks .
was space ,
did n't get very far on that
was so disgusted with it and even then
whatever one it was was it such a seller blockbuster .
got about a hundred pages through it
ca n't do this
kind of
's see
too many people read
that 's a big , thick book ?
for the
because that 's
awhile back and they have
take command ,
that was pretty good .
do n't know
'd call science it fiction or fantasy
sometimes it is awful hard ,
some of those get
they can
put them
loved
have a hole in my roof and
was waiting for the whole house to collapse and ,
read and rather ironic
is you reading dune .
that 's probably
, that was n't it
and the movie was awful .
was it ?
it was just terrible .
did n't see
do n't know ,
could n't figure out at all , what they were talking about ,
real in that
'll tell you ,
do you like scary things ?
books pretty scary
that 's true .
somebody saw the movie the other day here , told me ,
they did n't
or not want to go see
's the book
just
then wo n't tell you
that 's the one .
that 's the one .
because the character that is horrible so is another human being .
to kind of like him
this guy 's smart
the worst kind ,
