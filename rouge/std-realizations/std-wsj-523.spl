are
and do you have a family ?
is to both questions
do you and your wife and
.
the ones come every month
those into a spread
kind of what sort of range on
.
what do you do ?
is that
about every three months or so ,
from the largest bills
i part time working at night
and my husband work full times days
we have four checks , and so
we paid every week
that , and so does help
that helped a lot .
and then we do n't have ,
is so it ear
out
's every pence
who that work the best
cut and cut up the house payment in half
up , and between all
all the checks ,
we taking a huge sum out of one
the next check then we are real short pay and
a on kind of the unnecessary expenses
that 's true .
we kind eat out a bit more than we should have ,
things get out of hand
we thought it to be helpful really .
because of this and stuff like that really pay off
it helped you to focus where your money goes
is sure you felt before you got on a budget , the same frustration and
my , when
when all that money did
that 's a lot of money ,
where it does go ?
and we did this .
we real consistent with this
but we did it for about a month
we wrote down everything we bought and every pay check
and so we could see where every pence went
spend it and was
real with it
does it help
what other the thing helps we 're
if that way it kind of and and then was the amount entertainment gone for the month says .
that sounds like a really good idea .
it really and helpful
or anything like that
we have n't .
our initial goal was to retire completely just for car payments and credit card debt and all of that debt .
where we could start thinking about it
that 's good .
