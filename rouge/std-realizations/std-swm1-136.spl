would probably on a scale of one to ten being ten , no , kind of legislation and zero
like a total ban guns are just going to put on the guns
and they have a total ban on guns
in n't stop
or was that on rifles ?
think and also
and that did n't help at all ?
the crime is not any better or any worse ,
do n't know if it was any worse ,
but it certainly did n't get any better .
guns by
character along that nature and the seven days holding period and things
you should n't be able to go out there and just buy .
with that
the law on who can buy
think that kind of control , would be good and so
times you make the statement , just kind of a little bit it to and
the guns was only in the hands of the criminals ,
because the person who is being robbed have a gun
and maybe they do n't just report those
or 'm not sure
good thing they have their gun on them but
and they thwarted the attempt robbery .
'm not really sure ,
do n't own a gun , personally
would like to know how to handle one ,
think everybody should learn
you just never know when you might come .
how about that
so we ended up with these guns ,
and my only experience with a gun really were shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
hit me in the thumb
have with guns
kind and .
would feel better if
see someone
you have anytime of course in this world
that 's true .
do n't know if that 's a large percentage of crime or not
it would be some
and think that 's a good idea
would definitely support that
kind of
the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks but
that 's crazy .
carry guns in their vehicles
in the window back for
kind of
kind of
that 's
thanks for talking
you 're welcome .
