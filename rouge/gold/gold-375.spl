what ? 
do you want to start ? 
it does n't matter . 
we 're discussing the capital punishment , i believe . 
you are right . 
i suppose i should have , 
i am pro capital punishment except that i do n't like the way it 's done . 
i guess , i hate to see anyone die 
but i guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse i do n't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives . 
i agree . 
capital punishment is necessary in many cases 
it 's not a deterrent , 
or our jails would not be so full . 
there would n't be so many people in death row . 
something not gruesome but something more where people know that it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people . 
if you committed a certain crime , you were going to receive a death penalty 
and it was going to happen to you . 
no stays of execution . 
no loopholes , 
and even that i do n't really know if that would help . 
notoriety . 
the double reason 
and also the fact of notoriety . 
they become well known . 
they are almost like a big star . 
but they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal . 
they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years . 
that they are going to write a book . 
they are going to go on talk shows 
that 's a reward for a heinous crime rather than having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life . 
that 's for sure . 
there 's exceptions to the rule 
but most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure i do n't like to see that . 
it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again . 
they will . 
not if he 's killed he ca n't , do it again . 
that 's correct , 
if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is executed . 
the death penalty . 
but the chances are not great that that will happen . 
but there 's a greater chance that he 'll be back out on the streets in twelve years . 
i guess i 'm also looking at beyond even that . 
i guess i been thinking about it 
and i do n't have a definite opinion 
but repeat crimes maybe not the more mild ones but more severe ones especially on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people , and not just taking the money but beating them half to death . 
that 's right . 
just for pleasure too 
and i guess you 've got to look at something like that . 
do they deserve to remain on this earth too ? 
and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this . 
unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes , 
you would n't be able to under our system . 
china and a few other countries have a little different view of that . 
you get caught with dope there and you die , period . 
there is no appeals .
