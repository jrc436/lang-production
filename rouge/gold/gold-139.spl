what , 
go ahead and tell me about your home . 
my home at the moment is an apartment . 
is that right ? . 
that 's interesting . 
and let 's see , 
we are to compare homes . 
correct ? 
my home is typical for the area . 
i live in a development , 
it sounds like i 'm bragging . 
that 's okay . 
but it 's upper middle class kind of an environment . 
it 's a two story colonial , which my wife and i designed . 
that 's neat . 
that 's large . 
and i would imagine in terms of size and so forth , it 's relatively typical for the area . 
i would say it 's probably midsized for the area . 
there are some smaller , 
and there are , several larger . 
it is probably ten years old . 
that 's not too bad , 
that 's still fairly new . 
the housing there is extremely affordable compared to other parts of the country , 
do you mind if i ask what it 's worth down there , 
so , i have n't really priced in the market , 
although right now it 's a lot lower because of all the layoffs and everything 
the economy around here is real poor . 
i thought that was on the upswing again now . 
not really . 
there 's been tremendous amounts of , layoffs 
so , really housing is real bad . 
the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad , 
but housing is still real bad . 
it really is a buyer 's market there now . 
there has been a lot of speculative building . 
i do n't know , 
a new carrier was coming in and the attendant support vessels . 
that 's no longer , the case . 
it is . 
the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population . 
and so overbuilding has been a real problem there . 
so you can still get a good house for a very , very reasonable price . 
let 's say typical , say three bedroom two and a half baths , on a half acre or so of land , 
and probably , perhaps , cheaper , depending upon the neighborhood . 
what about your home ? 
but it is a home . 
it 's a four bedroom home . 
it 's on one floor . 
we have no basement . 
i do n't know , 
nor do we , 
i was n't sure . 
most of the ones up north and everything do , 
but anyway it 's also pretty typical for the area . 
most of this area was developed , 
it 's almost twenty years old , 
and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style . 
we have a friend that lives two blocks over , 
but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same . 
so i think most of them are 
like most areas that are built there were probably two or three styles you could choose from . 
and , that 's pretty much all the houses in the area , for probably a square mile at least , maybe even a little bit more than that . 
we are west . 
they designed it and everything , 
and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand . 
that 's not unusual , 
for example there is a condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live , 
and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium . 
it was very nicely done . 
sounds like a lot of money though , 
i ca n't envision spending that much money , on something along those lines . 
maybe a little bit higher than that now , 
but that same house here , you 'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year , taxes on it . 
that much of a difference ? 
it 's really sad . 
this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country . 
why is that ? 
do you know ? 
they do have such things as extremely good school systems , for example . 
it has one of the best school systems in the country . 
public employees make great salaries around here . 
this is the figure , 
they did not define it ,
