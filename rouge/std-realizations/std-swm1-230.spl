do not know
do not feel very stronger that the jury system should be changed
they generally and out
know now in some cases in some states
no some juries and longer
small as six people in minor felonies and misdemeanor trials as
but 's 's really happening in the real world a reflection of then what ?
if they keep giving everybody sentences hundred year ,
think that 's what 's happening
the judges save the people from having
that might be it .
, the people can not afford it
indeed the present conditions overcrowding and .
jail waiting for trial
so
you might be right about that .
do not know ,
only about ten percent of the cases for trial anyway come
the very
or end with the jury actually making the verdict up
with a conviction ?
that most of it is through
most of the cases or .
but how do you feel about the jury system itself ?
do you think that should be changed ?
my friends up for jury duty
most of it was robberies or things like that ,
it was not any serious crimes .
even any felony so apparently for the smallest crimes
they give the person for a jury the option .
on with the jury criminal trials
of some sort of
to of a long time
do not know ,
with enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system
read that there 's a shortage of judges
wo n't they not appoint them
but there 's no budget for them , i guess .
that and the courthouse go with them and the bailiffs and court the clerks .
.
do not
would replace it
do not
know ,
're looking
the crime is
do not know ,
they do not just care any more .
so many people in prison and yet .
it doubled in the last ten years
,
our population grown some too
and see and understand ever
could handle prison
it would be very difficult ,
drug related type things
there must be a very great degree of that .
do not know if the jury system itself comes in there to play again , but there
would think
of jurors after the trial the
how they reached that decision before television cameras and newspaper reporters
there 's a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that
know ,
was there during the trial actually ,
was true of me and
it 's a picture was not good enough .
we want to see ,
do not know what they wanted honestly
do not know
being , when he was certainly
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out
felt that way
but it does not matter .
the guy was guilty obviously .
always in the situation .
the jurors
one count .
but , do not know
make a judgment on somebody
a lousy job
or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it .
that might be it .
're getting a call coming in
with you .
it been nice talking
thank you .
