i do n't think that it 's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions . 
for instance , jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there 's , endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives . 
i agree with that . 
people that are driving like truck drivers and things like that . 
i definitely think they should be tested . 
and i 'm not opposed to any testing . 
how do you feel about companies drug testing prior to hiring ? 
i was tested within my company . 
because i do n't know of any other countries that are doing this 
and i feel like it 's really just within the united states . 
it 's okay . 
i think your record should stand for itself . that if you 've been tested at other companies and you 've always come up negative or whatever , then i do n't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over . 
and once you 've established the fact that you 're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you 're not . i think they could save money by not doing that every time , 
if you change jobs you would n't have to do it if you 'd just been tested at your other work place . 
what about random testing , though . 
do you feel like that 's an invasion of certain people 's rights if not everyone is tested ? 
not if it 's done fairly . 
and that 's probably my question is , how do you know it 's done fairly . 
i do n't know that you do . 
if it 's random , then it 's random 
and that 's not necessarily fair . 
they might tell you it 's random . 
but then it 's kind of like a lottery . 
somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries . 
and it 's not random . 
i see . 
how do they pick their people ? 
i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season 
but it 's almost discretionary on the coach 's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem . 
i see . 
do you think that should be implemented in the work place 
as a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs , do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested . 
not being a drug user i do n't have a problem with that personally 
but i think that might be a violation of someone 's rights . 
if someone 's having personal problems for some reason that 's causing them to behave differently 
and their manager assumes they have a drug problem 
if someone assumed that of me , i would be upset . 
and it 's based on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave normal . 
and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and your supervisor has accused you of using drugs . 
i agree with that . because i know personally myself , i 've been in the same job for three years , 
it will be three years in august 
and i 've already been drug tested three times . 
what type of job do you have ? 
i 'm an environmental engineer 
and i 've been drug tested three times 
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime 
so for some reason , i 've come up three times . 
that 's pretty high statistics . 
does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone ? 
not at all . 
it 's a legal job 
so it 's really strange . 
that is odd . 
i was drug tested not for the job i have now , but for the prior job , 
the job i have now , requested my , medical record from my old company 
so i do n't know if i was n't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me did n't request the drug test , because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion . 
for instance , does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say we 've already drug tested her 
and she came up negative . 
they do n't know that i do n't use drugs . 
they just tested me once . 
but , i used to work for a power company , 
and since i was just one of the office folk , i guess it was n't as important to them that they test me regularly . 
but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly just across the board . 
and are they tested random ? 
it 's a rotation . 
i see . 
but again , it depends on what job you 're in . 
the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot 
and the men that drive the trucks with the guys that fix the power lines are n't tested as much . 
but they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the drug testing schedule is . 
i see . 
they say we 're testing you tomorrow 
and we 'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here . 
so they know that . 
it 's made very clear upon hiring . 
have we spent our at least five minutes ? 
i think so . 
nice speaking to you . 
nice talking to you .
