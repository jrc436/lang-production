that 's one of my old favorites . 
so i 'll just ignore it . 
and now , i did like thirty something 
my daughter says nine oh two one oh . 
we like that one . 
that 's one of my favorites . 
and how old are you ? 
so you 're little bit younger than i am , 
but 
and i like it . 
i think it 's wonderful . 
it 's a good show . 
all of our kids are in sports , 
but that 's one that we watch . 
i like that , 
that 's a good show , too . 
very good . 
i did n't . 
it 's a good episode . 
the new character on there did . 
what time is it there ? 
it is twenty minutes to nine . 
i 'm twenty minutes to six here . 
three hours difference . 
what else do you like ? 
let 's see , 
i like a lot of different shows . 
let 's see , 
i like murder , she wrote . 
i never watched that ever in my entire life . 
a small bowl will be plenty . 
that 's mine . 
a small bowl will be better because it 's pretty fattening . 
talk to my daughter . 
all my children , 
i 've watched that for about twelve years . 
i 'm sure i watched it for more than that probably . 
twenty something . 
so that was a long time ago . 
she was my favorite character on there . 
i read the reason they killed her off was because they could n't settle a contract , 
and i said if they 're going to do that to her , i wo n't watch it . 
that 's great . 
i do like all my children , 
i do n't know . 
i like the people on it , i guess . 
i like it . 
i just wish they 'd bring some of the old characters back . 
tad 's going to come back , i bet , 
do you think ? 
i 'm sure he will . 
he 'll come back , show up at just the right moment . 
cliff 's on the young and the restless now . 
he is . 
so he 's out for good . 
he 's out for good . 
did they marry ? 
that 's how they left the show , but not in real life . 
and she 's happily married 
and that 's the reason she left the show . 
i guess she wanted a private life . 
i watch it maybe twice a month , 
so , i do n't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies . 
i watch . 
because i play lots of tennis 
and i 'm gone a lot , 
so , i do n't get to watch , 
i watch it everyday , religiously . 
i videotape it when i have to miss it . 
i used to be like that . 
i 'm that way about a lot of different shows . 
there 's two new characters on there . 
i do n't know if you know her or not . 
that 's a show i like . 
i do n't like her on it , 
i never have liked her , 
i just know which one she is . 
i never watch that one either . 
life goes on comes on about the time that we eat dinner , 
those are always pretty cute . 
murder , she wrote comes on opposite of that , 
and so , 
we like that real well . 
be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebody 's getting killed on it . 
i know . 
the kids already know who it is , 
i do n't know who it is , though , 
who is it ? 
ask them .
