. how 's your products been ? 
i really have n't had too many problems . 
seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out . 
i hear that one . 
have you had any lately go out ? 
unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time , when i bought my new house , 
and i really do n't have any recourse , 
so i had to call and have them all repaired and that . 
so you did n't get anything , 
even , all the warranties were out ? 
the refrigerator warranty 's still good , 
but the ice maker itself , passed its three years , 
and it was three years and two months . 
we just moved into a new house , too , 
so we had to buy all those , too . 
watch out . 
i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail 
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings . 
i just ended up using it . 
but , that 's about the only thing i 've had gone wrong . 
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances , 
it was within two days that all three of these stopped working , 
and the ice maker had to have a new pump , 
that 's incredible . 
so it was almost three hundred dollars for all three of them . 
and they all went out at the same time ? 
within two days of each other . 
or two days . 
it was n't a good week . 
i was pretty mad . 
and plus the place that i 'd bought them all had gone out of business , 
but still they were through that retailer , 
so i do n't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not . 
it 's frustrating . 
but i did n't have to worry about all that , because they were n't under warranty . 
so . it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all , 
they go out a lot ? 
i 've had two or three of those go out . 
one was under warranty , 
and the other two were n't , 
i do n't think products are getting much better though . 
i 'm in the manufacturing 
and make automotive air bags , the safety air bags . 
that 's interesting . 
it 's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment . 
we test everything after each assembly process , 
and so our testing is pretty thorough , 
do you test each individual one 
if you 've got ten , you test one , 
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay ? 
we test every one electrically . 
i think they test four or five a day , actually exploding the air bags 
but we do test during the assembly product , , 
so , each assembly process has an inspection right after it 's done , 
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process , 
that 's something i 've never had to use , 
i 've never been involved in an automobile accident , 
but i think it 's a great idea . 
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about 
they do all the testing that we have to do through the government , 
it 's incredible how much testing they have to do . 
i do n't mind spending the extra money on the car even if they pass the cost onto the consumer , because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing .
