with the benefits that we have working
and there 's absolutely no question is the most important benefit , for me
think it 's health care
think everybody would say that
and if you try to get it outside of your corporation , you 're going to pay an arm and a leg .
think sometimes it 's more important than salary
do you
do n't know
it can turn out to be important but since .
you know
know
in a given year , dental expenses really can kill you .
and he got
and we have four children
is outrageous and
people do n't have it
or maybe n't
that 's right .
that 's right .

they come a long way
at least some companies
and they have a very , very poor left policy as manager
and just do n't
particularly , single parents
some extended family is unlikely
that 's right .
that 's exactly right .
and it 's just a terrible choice ,
you should n't have to make it .
you 're right .
, of course , we get
i like
it 's
the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere
but you ca n't
listen
have friends in a lot of different cities
fly just care of that , if you .
that 's right .
you have to have an awful lot of fun
be half the fun
